		<h3>Tor</h3>
		<p><a href="https://www.torproject.org">Tor</a> is an encrypted anonymising network that makes it harder to intercept internet communications, or see where communications are coming from or going to.</p>
		<p>In order to use the WikiLeaks public submission system as detailed above you can download the Tor Browser Bundle, which is a Firefox-like browser available for Windows, Mac OS X and GNU/Linux and pre-configured to connect using the anonymising system Tor.</p>
		<h4>Tails</h4>
		<p>If you are at high risk and you have the capacity to do so, you can also access the submission system through a secure operating system called <a href="https://tails.boum.org">Tails</a>. Tails is an operating system launched from a USB stick or a DVD that aim to leaves no traces when the computer is shut down after use and automatically routes your internet traffic through Tor. Tails will require you to have either a USB stick or a DVD at least 4GB big and a laptop or desktop computer.</p>

		<h3>Tips</h3>
		<p>Our submission system works hard to preserve your anonymity, but we recommend you also take some of your own precautions. Please review these basic guidelines. </p>
		<div>
			<h4>1. Contact us if you have specific problems</h4>
			<p>If you have a very large submission, or a submission with a complex format, or are a high-risk source, please <a href="#submit_help_contact">contact us</a>. In our experience it is always possible to find a custom solution for even the most seemingly difficult situations.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h4>2. What computer to use</h4>
			<p>If the computer you are uploading from could subsequently be audited in an investigation, consider using a computer that is not easily tied to you. Technical users can also use <a href="https://tails.boum.org">Tails</a> to help ensure you do not leave any records of your submission on the computer.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h4>3. Do not talk about your submission to others</h4>
			<p>If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in source protection – it is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This includes other media organisations.</p>
		</div>

	</div>

		<h3>After</h3>

		<div>
			<h4>1. Do not talk about your submission to others</h4>
			<p>If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in source protection – it is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This includes other media organisations.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h4>2. Act normal</h4>
			<p>If you are a high-risk source, avoid saying anything or doing anything after submitting which might promote suspicion. In particular, you should try to stick to your normal routine and behaviour.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h4>3. Remove traces of your submission</h4>
			<p>If you are a high-risk source and the computer you prepared your submission on, or uploaded it from, could subsequently be audited in an investigation, we recommend that you format and dispose of the computer hard drive and any other storage media you used.</p>
			<p>In particular, hard drives retain data after formatting which may be visible to a digital forensics team and flash media (USB sticks, memory cards and SSD drives) retain data even after a secure erasure. If you used flash media to store sensitive data, it is important to destroy the media.</p>
			<p>If you do this and are a high-risk source you should make sure there are no traces of the clean-up, since such traces themselves may draw suspicion.</p>
			<div>
				<h4>4. If you face legal action</h4>
				<p>If a legal action is brought against you as a result of your submission, there are organisations that may help you. The Courage Foundation is an international organisation dedicated to the protection of journalistic sources. You can find more details at <a href="https://www.couragefound.org">https://www.couragefound.org</a>.</p>

		<p>WikiLeaks publishes documents of political or historical importance that are censored or otherwise suppressed. We specialise in strategic global publishing and large archives.</p>
		<p>The following is the address of our secure site where you can anonymously upload your documents to WikiLeaks editors. You can only access this submissions system through Tor. (See our <a href="#submit_help_tor">Tor tab</a> for more information.) We also advise you to read our <a href="#submit_help_tips">tips for sources</a> before submitting.</p>

			<!--<div>
				Copy this address into your Tor browser. Advanced users, if they wish, can also add a further layer of encryption to their submission using <a href="#submit_wlkey">our public PGP key</a>.
			</div>-->
		</div>

		<p>If you cannot use Tor, or your submission is very large, or you have specific requirements, WikiLeaks provides several alternative methods. <a href="#submit_help_contact">Contact us</a> to discuss how to proceed.</p>

SUBJECT: SECURITY COUNCIL DEBATE ON SITUATION IN SOUTHEAST
ASIA, FEB 23.
SUMMARY: IN ITS SECOND DAY OF DEBATE ON THE SITUATION IN

STATEMENTS BY FRANCE, UK, ZAMBIA, BANGLADESH, JAMAICA,
DEMOCRATIC KAMPUCHEA, VIETNAM, CANADA, NEW ZEALAND, CUBA,
INDIA, AUSTRALIA AND POLAND. BOTH VIETNAM AND CUBA
ACCUSED THE US OF COLLUSION WITH CHINA IN ITS ATTACK ON
VIETNAM. KAMPUCHEA REITERATED ITS OFT-STATED
CHARGES AGAINST VIETNAM AND POLAND ECHOED THE SOVIET VIEWPOINT. OTHER MEMBERS GENERALLY ADDRESSED BOTH CONFLICTS
AND CALLED FOR AN IMMEDIATE END TO HOSTILITIES, WITHDRAWAL
OF FOREIGN FORCES, RESTRAINT BY ALL OTHERS AND, IN MANY
CASES, EFFORTS TOWARD A PROCESS OF PEACEFUL SETTLEMENT OF
THE UNDERLYING ISSUES. MANY COMMENDED TO THE PARTIES
THE SYG'S OFFER OF GOOD OFFICES. THE COUNCIL WILL MEET
AGAIN SUNDAY, FEB 25 AT 3:30. SPEAKERS ALREADY LISTED FOR
THAT MEETING ARE MALAYSIA, THAILAND, JAPAN, HUNGARY, GDR,
SINGAPORE, PHILIPPINES, INDONESIA AND BULGARIA. END

WITHDRAW TO THEIR RESPECTIVE COUNTRIES. FRANCE WILL CONSIDER ANY RESOLUTION WHICH IS INTENDED TO BRING THESE RESULTS AND A PEACEFUL SETTLEMENT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE
PRINCIPELS OF RESPECT FOR INDEPENDENCE AND
TERRITORIAL INTEGRITY OF EACH OF THE STATES IN INDOCHINA.
3. UK: AMB RICHARD CITED THE SC'S RESPONSIBILITY TO ACT IN
A SITUATION THAT HAD DETERIORATED SINCE THE VIETNAMESE
INVASION OF KAMPUCHEA. NOW CHINA HAD MOUNTED AN ATTACK ON
VIETNAM AND THERE WAS A RISK OF OUTSIDE POWERS BEING DRAWN
INTO THE CONFLICT. REITERATING HIS GOVERNMENTS POSITION ON
THE KAMPUCHEAN QUESTION, RICHARD CRITICIZED BOTH VIETNAM
AND CHINA FOR VIOLATING THE CHARTER. HE URGED CHINA TO
WITHDRAW IMMEDIATELY FROM VIETNA. HE REFERRED TO THE ASEAN
STATEMENT OF FEB 20 AND SUGGESTED THAT IT MIGHT OFFER A
BASIS FOR A COUNCIL RESOLUTION, FOR WHICH THERE WERE THREE
MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS: AN UNAMBIGUOUS CALL ON ALL PARTIES
TO CEASE HOSTILITIES; A WITHDRAWAL OF ALL FOREIGN FORCES
FROM AREAS OF CONFLICT IN SEA AND RETURN TO COUNTRIES FROM
WHICH THEY CAME; AND A RESTATEMENT OF &quot;OUR COMMITMENT&quot; TO
THE PRINCIPLE OF SOVEREIGNTY, TERRITORIAL INTEGRITY AND
INVIOLABILITY OF ALL STATES. HE WARNED AGAINST THE DANGER

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
OF A &quot;DRIFT&quot; INTO A MAJOR CONFLICT. NOTING THE SYG'S OFFER
OF GOOD OFFICES, STATEMENTS BY CHINA AND VIETNAM THAT THEY
ARE READY TO NEGOTIATE, AND SUGGESTIONS THAT THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY MIGHT HELP IN SOME WAY TOWARD A RESOLUTION
OF THE AREA'S PROBLEMS, RICHARD SUGGESTED ADOPTION OF A
RESOLUTION SUCH AS HE SUGGESTED WOULD HELP PROVIDE TIME TO
CONSIDER THESE POSSIBILITIES.
4. ZAMBIAN CHARGE MUTUKWA SUPPORTED SC CONSIDERATION OF THE
SITUATION IN SEA AS REQUIRED BY ART 24 OF THE CHARTER ON
THE COUNCIL'S PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITY FOR MAINTENANCE OF
INTERNATIONAL PEACE AND SECURITY. NOTING THAT LIMITED
WARS CAN TRIGGER GENERALIZED WARS, HE WARNED THAT THE CONUNCLASSIFIED

FLICT COULD EVENTUALLY BRING POWERFUL NUCLEAR POWERS INTO
CONFRONTATION. HE CALLED ON THE PARTIES TO THE CONFLICTS
IN SEA TO CEASEFIRE IMMEDIATELY AND END HOSTILITIES AND
TO NEGOTIATE SERIOUSLY EITHER BILATERALLY OR THROUGH THE
AEGIS OF THE SYG'S GOOD OFFICES. HE SUGGESTED A COMMITTEE
OF SC MEMBERS COULD ASSIST IN MEDIATING THE DISPUTES.
MUTUKWA CONCLUDED WITH AN APPEAL TO THE PERMANENT SC MEMBERS
NOT TO ABUSE THE VETO POWER, AS IT WAS INESCAPABLE TO CONCLUDE THAT THE PRESENT SITUATION IN SEA IS A THREAT TO
INTERNATIONAL PEACE AND SECURITY ON WHICH THE SC MUST TAKE
APPROPRIATE ACTION.
5. BANGLADESH: REFERRING TO THE COUNCIL'S CONSIDERATION OF
THE SITUATION IN SEA IN JANUARY, AMB KAISER EXPRESSED
&quot;GRAVEST CONCERN AND ANXIETY&quot; OVER THE CIRCLE OF
ACTION, REACTION AND COUNTERACTION AND THE &quot;WIDER OMINOUS
IMPLICATIONS&quot; IT HOLDS. HE CITED FOUR CARDINAL FACTORS.
FIRST, THE UN MUST TAKE RESOLUTE ACTION. BILATERAL CONTACTS
AND PERSUASION AND OTHER BEHIND THE SCENES ACTIVITIES WERE
BENEFICIAL, BUT HE WAS CONVINCED THE UN SHOULD AUTOMATICALLY TAKE UP CRITICAL ISSUES, IRRESPECTIVE OF WHERE THEY
ARISE. VIOLENCE ANYWHERE THREATENS PEOPLE EVERYWHERE.
HE HAD, THEREFORE, SUPPORTED THE CALL FOR A SC MEETING.
SECONDLY, THE FIRST PRIORITY WAS TO UPHOLD CHARGER PRINCIPLES, INCLUDING RESPECT FOR SOVEREIGN RIGHTS TO PEACE,
INDEPENDENCE, TERRITORIAL INTEGRITY AND SELF-DETERMINATION,
WITHOUT OUTSIDE INTERFERENCE, AS WELL AS NON-USE OF FORCE

ACCUSATION, RECRIMINATION AND MORAL JUDGMENT IN COMPLEX
ISSUES AND TO ACT CONSTRUCTIVELY FOR A DURABLE PEACE

ARE REQUIRED: CESSATION OF HOSTILITIES IN ENTIRE REGION
WITH RESPECT FOR POLITICAL INDEPENDENCE OF ALL STATES INVOLVED, WITHDRAWAL OF ALL TROOPS FROM FOREIGN TERRITORIES,
AND EXERCISE OF MAXIMUM RESTRAINT BY ALL OUTSIDE POWERS.
KAISER ALSO URGED THE COUNCIL TO PROMOTE ALL AVENUES TOWARD
NORMALIZATION OF THE SITUATION AND PEACEFUL SETTLEMENT. HE
WELCOMED THE SYG'S GOOD OFFICE OFFER AND URGED THE PARTIES
TO SEIZE ON IT. HE ALSO EMPHASIZED BANGLADESH'S LONGSTANDING SUPPORT FOR A ZONE OF PEACE, FREEDOM AND NEUTRALITY
IN SOUTHEAST ASIA.
6. JAMAICAN AMB MILLS ALSO FEARED A POSSIBLE WIDENING OF
THE CONFLICT. HE DID NOT WISH TO ENGAGE IN RECRIMINATION
AND ACRIMONIOUS CHARGES, BUT RATHER SEEK TO PROMOTE A
HARMONIOUS SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEMS ON THE BASIS OF CHARTER
PRINCIPLES, WHICH HE HAD CITED IN JANUARY AND WERE APPLICABLE TO THE NEW OUTBREAK OF HOSTILITIES. HE CALLED ON
THE PARTIES TO END HOSTILITIES AND WITHDRAW TROOPS FROM
FOREIGN TERRITORY AND TO RESPECT THE INDEPENDENCE AND TERRITORIAL INTEGRITY OF ALL STATES. HE ALSO URGED RESTRAINT BY
ALL &quot;OUTSIDE INTERESTS.&quot; MILLS EXPRESSED WILLINGNESS TO
PARTICIPATE IN ANY EFFORT TO HAVE THE SC DEAL CONSTRUCTIVELY EIYH THE SITUATION AND IN THIS CONNECTION WELCOMED THE
SYG'S GOOD OFFICES OFFER AND ENCOURAGED ANY OTHER CONCILIATORY MEASURES. HE SHARED ZAMBIA'S HOPE THAT THE SC WOULD
BE PERMITTED TO TAKE A CLEAR-CUT DECISION.

CALLED FOR SC ACTION ON THE SAME LINES AS REQUESTED BY
CHINA.
8. VIETNAM: IN BY FAR THE LENGTHIEST STATEMENT OF THE DAY
AMB HA VAN LAU REVIEWED ITS COMPLAINTS AGAINST CHINA, AS
OUTLINED IN THE NUMEROUS COMMUNICATIONS IT HAS SENT TO THE
SC AND SYG. HE ALSO REVIEWED HISTORY OF DIFFICULTIES
BETWEEN VIETNAM AND CHINA, CLAIMING PROBLEM STARTED IN 1965
WHEN DENG XIAOPING MADE TRIP TO VIETNAM TO PERSUADE THE
VIETNAMESE TO ACCEPT CHINESE AID IN PLACE OF SOVIET ASSIS-

TANCE. WHEN VIETNAMESE REFUSED, THEY BEGAN BLOCKING SOVIET
SHIPMENTS TO VIETNAM AND PROVOKING VIETNAM IN ALL KINDS OF
WAYS AT EVERY OPPORTUNITY. TURNING TO RECENT EVENTS, LAU
CLAIMED THAT INFORMATION HAD COME TO VIETNAM'S ATTENTION
THAT DURING DENG'S VISIT TO THE US, CHINA HAD RECEIVED
&quot;CONSENT, IF NOT ENCOURAGEMENT&quot; TO INVADE VIETNAM. HE
MADE SEVERAL COMPARISONS BETWEEN CHINESE ACTIONS AND THOSE
OF JOHNSON ADMINISTRATION, E.G. CHINA USED SAME TRICKERY
IN CALLING FOR NEGOTIATIONS AT SAME TIME THEY WERE PREUNCLASSIFIED

PARING TO LAUNCH AN ATTACK. ALSO, CHINESE SPOKE OF LIMITED
WAR TO PUNISH VIETNAM, IN SAME WAY AS JOHNSON ADMINISTRATION. THE US DELEGATE, LAU ALLEGED, PURPOSELY SOUGHT TO
SOW CONFUSION IN CALLING FOR DISCUSSION OF SITUATION IN
SOUTHEAST ASIA. THERE WAS NO PROBLEM IN SEA EXCEPT THE
CHINESE AGGRESSION AGAINST VIETNAM AND THE FACT THAT US
LINKED THAT QUESTION WITH KAMPUCHEA PROVED ITS
COLLUSION IN THE AGGRESSION AGAINST VIETNAM. HE ALSO
WARNED THAT THERE COULD BE NO POSSIBLE TRADE-OFF BETWEEN
WITHDRAWAL OF CHINESE FORCES FROM VIETNAM AND VIETNAMESE
FROM KAMPUCHEA AS VIETNAM WAS EXTENDING ASSISTANCE TO A
FRIENDLY COUNTRY AT ITS REQUEST, IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE
CHARTER, WHILE CHINA WAS MILITARILY SUPPORTING THE REMNANTS
OF THE POL POT FORCES AND ENGAGED IN AGGRESSION IN VIET NAM.
9. CANADIAN AMB BARTON NOTED THAT A MEASURE OF CANADA'S
CONCERN WAS THE UNUSUAL STEP IT HAD TAKEN IN JOINING A
LETTER TO THE SC PRESIDENT IN SUPPORT OF THIS DEBATE. HE
POINTED OUT THE DUTY OF THE SC NOT ONLY TO REVIEW THE
FACTS OF THE PRESENT CRISIS BUT TO CONSIDER PRACTICAL
MEASURES TO HELP DEFUSE THE SITUATION AND, IN TIME, TO RESTORE PEACE. CALLING FOR RESTRAINT BY ALL, HE URGED THE
COUNCIL TO OBTAIN AN IMMEDIATE CESSATION OF HOSTILITIES
AND WITHDRAWAL OF FOREIGN FORCES FROM CAMBODIA AND VIETNAM,
AND TO CONSIDER PRACTICAL WAYS TO DEVELOP A CLIMATE CONDUCIVE TO PEACE, SECURITY AND STABILITY. BUT BARTON SAID
IT WOULD BE A MISTAKE TO CONCENTRATE ONLY ON CURRENT OUTBURSTS OF VIOLENCE AND IGNORE OTHER ILLS. CITING CANADA'S
PAST RECORD OF DEPLORING HUMAN RIGHTS DENIALS IN THE REGION
HE CALLED ON THE SC AND THE UN AS A WHOLE TO CONSIDER URGENTLY WHAT MODALITIES MIGHT BE ESTABLISHED TO ALLEVIATE
CONDITIONS WHICH HAVE DRIVEN HUMAN BEINGS TO JOIN THE REFUGEE FLOW. HE THOUGHT THE SYG WAS WELL-PLACED TO PLAY A

USEFUL ROLE IN HELPING TO ESTABLISH THE NECESSARY CONDITIONS
OF PEACE AND SECURITY IN THE REGION. HE HOPED THE SC MIGHT
INVITE THE SYG INFORMALLY &quot;TO EXPLORE POSSIBILITIES THAT
MAY BE OPEN AND ACCEPTABLE TO THOSE MOST DIRECTLY INVOLVED
FOR A POLITICAL MEETING&quot; AIMED AT &quot;TRANSLATING INTO MUTUALLY ACCEPTABLE POLITICAL REALITIES THE ISSUES OF
CONTENTION.&quot;
10. NEW ZEALAND AMB FRANCIS SAID CHINA'S ACTION WAS CLEARLY A REAPONSE TO THE INVASION OF CAMBODIA BY VIETNAM.
THIS WAS NO JUSTIFICATION, HOWEVER, AND FORCES SHOULD BE
WITHDRAWN IMMEDIATELY IN BOTH CASES. CITING THE SOVIETVIETNAMESE FRIENDSHIP TREATY, HE EXPRESSED HOPE THAT STATESMANSHIP WOULD BE EXHIBITED BY WORLD LEADERS SO AS TO
AVOID FURTHER ESCALATION OF VIOLENCE. THERE MUST ALSO BE
EFFORTS TO RESOLVE THE SITUATION PEACEFULLY AND PERMANENTLY.
HIS GOVERNMENT HAD NOTED WITH INTEREST SUGGESTIONS FOR AN
INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE TO REACH AGREEMENT ON GUARANTEEING
THE INDEPENDENCE AND NEUTRALITY OF CAMBODIA. HIS GOVERNMENT BELIEVED SC MEMBERS SHOULD SERIOUSLY CONSIDER PROMOTING DISCUSSIONS BETWEEN THE PARTIES, WHETHER IN A CONFERENCE
UNDER THE COUNCIL'S AEGIS, THROUGH THE SYG'S GOOD OFFICES
OR IN ANY OTHER APPROPRIATE MANNER, TO RESOLVE THE CAMBODIAN PROBLEM. UNTIL IT WAS RESOLVED, TENSION WOULD CONTINUE.

DERED WHY THE CHINESE HAD NOT TAKEN SUCH A STAND REGARDING
THE EUROPEAN ENCLAVES ON CHINESE TERRITORY OR TAIWAN. ROA
KOURI SUGGESTED THAT DENG XIAOPING HAD BEEN &quot;BEWITCHED BY
THE ALMIGHTY DOLLAR&quot; AND HAD SEEN THE POSSIBILITIES OF
&quot;COLLUSION&quot; WITH THE NORTH AMERICAN IMPERIALISTS IN CHINA'S
EFFORTS TO DOMINATE SEA. HOW COULD ONE EXPLAIN CHINA'S
ACTION IMMEDIATELY AFTER DENG'S RETURN IF HE HAD NOT OBTAINED APPROVAL OF WASHINGTON. HE ALLEGED A &quot;DEEP-SEATED
REACTIONARY IDENTITY&quot; BETWEEN WASHINGTON AND PEKING. AFTER
THEIR IGNAMINIOUS DEFEAT THE NORTH AMERICANS ALSO HOPED
TO REGAIN LOST GROUND. ROA KOURI DECLARED THAT CUBA IS
WILLING TO SHED ITS OWN BLOOD FOR VIETNAM. HE ASSERTED
THAT THE PEOPLES OF THE WORLD, PROGRESSIVE FORCES IN ALL
COUNTRIES, THE FATHERLAND OF LENIN, AND ALL THE STATES OF
THE SOCIALIST CAMP SUPPORT VIETNAM IN ITS JUST STRUGGLE
AGAINST THE FOREIGN INVADERS. HE CALLED UPON THE COUNCIL
TO CONDEMN &quot;THIS CRIMINAL ADVENTURE&quot; AND SHOW SOLIDARITY
WITH THE VICTIMS OF AGGRESSION, TO DEMAND THE IMMEDIATE
WITHDRAWAL OF ALL THE INVADING TROOPS OF THE &quot;NEO-FASCIST
CLIQUE OF DENG XIAOPING&quot;, AND THE &quot;PUNISHMENT&quot; CHINA DESERVES.

AND HAD PERSONALLY UNDERLINED TO THE CHINESE AUTHORITIES
THE NEED TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM PEACEFULLY. NOTING THAT CHINA
REPORTEDLY HAS DECLARED ITS INTENTION TO WITHDRAW, HE SAW
NO REASON FOR DELAY. HE STRESSED THAT &quot;IT IS IMPERATIVE

SPEECH TO THE CHINESE ATTACK, JAIPAL STATED THAT BOTH
VIETNAM AND KAMPUCHEA HAVE THE RIGHT TO FULFILL THEIR ASPIRATIONS FREE OF OUTSIDE INTERFERENCE, AND HE REGRETTED THAT

SUBJECT: SECURITY COUNCIL DEBATE ON SITUATION IN SOUTHEAST
ASIA, FEB 23.
SUMMARY: IN ITS SECOND DAY OF DEBATE ON THE SITUATION IN
SOUTHEAST ASIA, THE UN SECURITY COUNCIL FEB 24 HEARD
STATEMENTS BY FRANCE, UK, ZAMBIA, BANGLADESH, JAMAICA,
DEMOCRATIC KAMPUCHEA, VIETNAM, CANADA, NEW ZEALAND, CUBA,
INDIA, AUSTRALIA AND POLAND. BOTH VIETNAM AND CUBA
ACCUSED THE US OF COLLUSION WITH CHINA IN ITS ATTACK ON
VIETNAM. KAMPUCHEA REITERATED ITS OFT-STATED
CHARGES AGAINST VIETNAM AND POLAND ECHOED THE SOVIET VIEWPOINT. OTHER MEMBERS GENERALLY ADDRESSED BOTH CONFLICTS
AND CALLED FOR AN IMMEDIATE END TO HOSTILITIES, WITHDRAWAL
OF FOREIGN FORCES, RESTRAINT BY ALL OTHERS AND, IN MANY
CASES, EFFORTS TOWARD A PROCESS OF PEACEFUL SETTLEMENT OF
THE UNDERLYING ISSUES. MANY COMMENDED TO THE PARTIES
THE SYG'S OFFER OF GOOD OFFICES. THE COUNCIL WILL MEET
AGAIN SUNDAY, FEB 25 AT 3:30. SPEAKERS ALREADY LISTED FOR
THAT MEETING ARE MALAYSIA, THAILAND, JAPAN, HUNGARY, GDR,
SINGAPORE, PHILIPPINES, INDONESIA AND BULGARIA. END
SUMMARY.
2. FRANCE: EXPRESSING GRAVE CONCERN OVER THE SITUATION IN
SOUTHEAST ASIA AND SUPPORT FOR THE PRINCIPLES OF THE UN
CHARTER, FRENCH AMB LE PRETTE CALLED FOR THE SC TO TAKE
ACTION TO INSURE THAT HOSTILITIES CEASE AND FOREIGN FORCES

WITHDRAW TO THEIR RESPECTIVE COUNTRIES. FRANCE WILL CONSIDER ANY RESOLUTION WHICH IS INTENDED TO BRING THESE RESULTS AND A PEACEFUL SETTLEMENT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE
PRINCIPELS OF RESPECT FOR INDEPENDENCE AND
TERRITORIAL INTEGRITY OF EACH OF THE STATES IN INDOCHINA.
3. UK: AMB RICHARD CITED THE SC'S RESPONSIBILITY TO ACT IN
A SITUATION THAT HAD DETERIORATED SINCE THE VIETNAMESE
INVASION OF KAMPUCHEA. NOW CHINA HAD MOUNTED AN ATTACK ON
VIETNAM AND THERE WAS A RISK OF OUTSIDE POWERS BEING DRAWN
INTO THE CONFLICT. REITERATING HIS GOVERNMENTS POSITION ON
THE KAMPUCHEAN QUESTION, RICHARD CRITICIZED BOTH VIETNAM
AND CHINA FOR VIOLATING THE CHARTER. HE URGED CHINA TO
WITHDRAW IMMEDIATELY FROM VIETNA. HE REFERRED TO THE ASEAN
STATEMENT OF FEB 20 AND SUGGESTED THAT IT MIGHT OFFER A
BASIS FOR A COUNCIL RESOLUTION, FOR WHICH THERE WERE THREE
MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS: AN UNAMBIGUOUS CALL ON ALL PARTIES
TO CEASE HOSTILITIES; A WITHDRAWAL OF ALL FOREIGN FORCES
FROM AREAS OF CONFLICT IN SEA AND RETURN TO COUNTRIES FROM
WHICH THEY CAME; AND A RESTATEMENT OF &quot;OUR COMMITMENT&quot; TO
THE PRINCIPLE OF SOVEREIGNTY, TERRITORIAL INTEGRITY AND
INVIOLABILITY OF ALL STATES. HE WARNED AGAINST THE DANGER

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014

ARE READY TO NEGOTIATE, AND SUGGESTIONS THAT THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY MIGHT HELP IN SOME WAY TOWARD A RESOLUTION
OF THE AREA'S PROBLEMS, RICHARD SUGGESTED ADOPTION OF A
RESOLUTION SUCH AS HE SUGGESTED WOULD HELP PROVIDE TIME TO
CONSIDER THESE POSSIBILITIES.

FLICT COULD EVENTUALLY BRING POWERFUL NUCLEAR POWERS INTO
CONFRONTATION. HE CALLED ON THE PARTIES TO THE CONFLICTS
IN SEA TO CEASEFIRE IMMEDIATELY AND END HOSTILITIES AND
TO NEGOTIATE SERIOUSLY EITHER BILATERALLY OR THROUGH THE
AEGIS OF THE SYG'S GOOD OFFICES. HE SUGGESTED A COMMITTEE
OF SC MEMBERS COULD ASSIST IN MEDIATING THE DISPUTES.
MUTUKWA CONCLUDED WITH AN APPEAL TO THE PERMANENT SC MEMBERS
NOT TO ABUSE THE VETO POWER, AS IT WAS INESCAPABLE TO CONCLUDE THAT THE PRESENT SITUATION IN SEA IS A THREAT TO
INTERNATIONAL PEACE AND SECURITY ON WHICH THE SC MUST TAKE
APPROPRIATE ACTION.
5. BANGLADESH: REFERRING TO THE COUNCIL'S CONSIDERATION OF
THE SITUATION IN SEA IN JANUARY, AMB KAISER EXPRESSED
&quot;GRAVEST CONCERN AND ANXIETY&quot; OVER THE CIRCLE OF
ACTION, REACTION AND COUNTERACTION AND THE &quot;WIDER OMINOUS
IMPLICATIONS&quot; IT HOLDS. HE CITED FOUR CARDINAL FACTORS.
FIRST, THE UN MUST TAKE RESOLUTE ACTION. BILATERAL CONTACTS
AND PERSUASION AND OTHER BEHIND THE SCENES ACTIVITIES WERE
BENEFICIAL, BUT HE WAS CONVINCED THE UN SHOULD AUTOMATICALLY TAKE UP CRITICAL ISSUES, IRRESPECTIVE OF WHERE THEY
ARISE. VIOLENCE ANYWHERE THREATENS PEOPLE EVERYWHERE.
HE HAD, THEREFORE, SUPPORTED THE CALL FOR A SC MEETING.
SECONDLY, THE FIRST PRIORITY WAS TO UPHOLD CHARGER PRINCIPLES, INCLUDING RESPECT FOR SOVEREIGN RIGHTS TO PEACE,
INDEPENDENCE, TERRITORIAL INTEGRITY AND SELF-DETERMINATION,
WITHOUT OUTSIDE INTERFERENCE, AS WELL AS NON-USE OF FORCE
UNCLASSIFIED

PAGE 03

USUN N 00793 02 OF 05 250631Z

TO SETTLE DISPUTES. THE THIRD FACTOR WAS TO AVOID
ACCUSATION, RECRIMINATION AND MORAL JUDGMENT IN COMPLEX
ISSUES AND TO ACT CONSTRUCTIVELY FOR A DURABLE PEACE

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
AND SECURITY IN THE AREA. FINALLY, THREE IMMEDIATE ACTIONS
ARE REQUIRED: CESSATION OF HOSTILITIES IN ENTIRE REGION
WITH RESPECT FOR POLITICAL INDEPENDENCE OF ALL STATES INVOLVED, WITHDRAWAL OF ALL TROOPS FROM FOREIGN TERRITORIES,
AND EXERCISE OF MAXIMUM RESTRAINT BY ALL OUTSIDE POWERS.
KAISER ALSO URGED THE COUNCIL TO PROMOTE ALL AVENUES TOWARD
NORMALIZATION OF THE SITUATION AND PEACEFUL SETTLEMENT. HE
WELCOMED THE SYG'S GOOD OFFICE OFFER AND URGED THE PARTIES
TO SEIZE ON IT. HE ALSO EMPHASIZED BANGLADESH'S LONGSTANDING SUPPORT FOR A ZONE OF PEACE, FREEDOM AND NEUTRALITY
IN SOUTHEAST ASIA.
6. JAMAICAN AMB MILLS ALSO FEARED A POSSIBLE WIDENING OF
THE CONFLICT. HE DID NOT WISH TO ENGAGE IN RECRIMINATION
AND ACRIMONIOUS CHARGES, BUT RATHER SEEK TO PROMOTE A
HARMONIOUS SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEMS ON THE BASIS OF CHARTER
PRINCIPLES, WHICH HE HAD CITED IN JANUARY AND WERE APPLICABLE TO THE NEW OUTBREAK OF HOSTILITIES. HE CALLED ON
THE PARTIES TO END HOSTILITIES AND WITHDRAW TROOPS FROM
FOREIGN TERRITORY AND TO RESPECT THE INDEPENDENCE AND TERRITORIAL INTEGRITY OF ALL STATES. HE ALSO URGED RESTRAINT BY
ALL &quot;OUTSIDE INTERESTS.&quot; MILLS EXPRESSED WILLINGNESS TO
PARTICIPATE IN ANY EFFORT TO HAVE THE SC DEAL CONSTRUCTIVELY EIYH THE SITUATION AND IN THIS CONNECTION WELCOMED THE
SYG'S GOOD OFFICES OFFER AND ENCOURAGED ANY OTHER CONCILIATORY MEASURES. HE SHARED ZAMBIA'S HOPE THAT THE SC WOULD
BE PERMITTED TO TAKE A CLEAR-CUT DECISION.

WITHDRAWING OSTENTATIOUSLY FROM ROOM AS AMB PRASITY TOOK
HIS PLACE. VIETNAMESE AMB LAU AND MONGOLIANS ALSO LEFT
ROOM, ALTHOUGH OTHER VIETNAMESE DEL MEMBERS REMAINED IN ADVISERS' SEATS AT SIDE OF CHAMBER.) PRASITH BROKE NO NEW
GROUND IN HIS STATEMENT, WHICH WAS A ROUTINE REPETITION OF
KAMPUCHEA'S GRIEVANCES AGAINST VIETNAM AND THEIR SOVIET
SUPPORTERS. HE CHARGED THAT PHNOM PENH IS NOW OCCUPIED BY
SOVIET AND CUBAN ADVISERS ALONG WITH THE VIETNAMESE. HE
CALLED FOR SC ACTION ON THE SAME LINES AS REQUESTED BY
CHINA.
8. VIETNAM: IN BY FAR THE LENGTHIEST STATEMENT OF THE DAY
AMB HA VAN LAU REVIEWED ITS COMPLAINTS AGAINST CHINA, AS
OUTLINED IN THE NUMEROUS COMMUNICATIONS IT HAS SENT TO THE
SC AND SYG. HE ALSO REVIEWED HISTORY OF DIFFICULTIES
BETWEEN VIETNAM AND CHINA, CLAIMING PROBLEM STARTED IN 1965
WHEN DENG XIAOPING MADE TRIP TO VIETNAM TO PERSUADE THE
VIETNAMESE TO ACCEPT CHINESE AID IN PLACE OF SOVIET ASSIS-

TANCE. WHEN VIETNAMESE REFUSED, THEY BEGAN BLOCKING SOVIET
SHIPMENTS TO VIETNAM AND PROVOKING VIETNAM IN ALL KINDS OF
WAYS AT EVERY OPPORTUNITY. TURNING TO RECENT EVENTS, LAU
CLAIMED THAT INFORMATION HAD COME TO VIETNAM'S ATTENTION
THAT DURING DENG'S VISIT TO THE US, CHINA HAD RECEIVED
&quot;CONSENT, IF NOT ENCOURAGEMENT&quot; TO INVADE VIETNAM. HE
MADE SEVERAL COMPARISONS BETWEEN CHINESE ACTIONS AND THOSE
OF JOHNSON ADMINISTRATION, E.G. CHINA USED SAME TRICKERY
IN CALLING FOR NEGOTIATIONS AT SAME TIME THEY WERE PREUNCLASSIFIED

USUN N 00793 03 OF 05 250633Z

PARING TO LAUNCH AN ATTACK. ALSO, CHINESE SPOKE OF LIMITED
WAR TO PUNISH VIETNAM, IN SAME WAY AS JOHNSON ADMINISTRATION. THE US DELEGATE, LAU ALLEGED, PURPOSELY SOUGHT TO
SOW CONFUSION IN CALLING FOR DISCUSSION OF SITUATION IN
SOUTHEAST ASIA. THERE WAS NO PROBLEM IN SEA EXCEPT THE
CHINESE AGGRESSION AGAINST VIETNAM AND THE FACT THAT US
LINKED THAT QUESTION WITH KAMPUCHEA PROVED ITS
COLLUSION IN THE AGGRESSION AGAINST VIETNAM. HE ALSO
WARNED THAT THERE COULD BE NO POSSIBLE TRADE-OFF BETWEEN
WITHDRAWAL OF CHINESE FORCES FROM VIETNAM AND VIETNAMESE
FROM KAMPUCHEA AS VIETNAM WAS EXTENDING ASSISTANCE TO A
FRIENDLY COUNTRY AT ITS REQUEST, IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE
CHARTER, WHILE CHINA WAS MILITARILY SUPPORTING THE REMNANTS
OF THE POL POT FORCES AND ENGAGED IN AGGRESSION IN VIET NAM.
9. CANADIAN AMB BARTON NOTED THAT A MEASURE OF CANADA'S
CONCERN WAS THE UNUSUAL STEP IT HAD TAKEN IN JOINING A
LETTER TO THE SC PRESIDENT IN SUPPORT OF THIS DEBATE. HE
POINTED OUT THE DUTY OF THE SC NOT ONLY TO REVIEW THE
FACTS OF THE PRESENT CRISIS BUT TO CONSIDER PRACTICAL
MEASURES TO HELP DEFUSE THE SITUATION AND, IN TIME, TO RESTORE PEACE. CALLING FOR RESTRAINT BY ALL, HE URGED THE
COUNCIL TO OBTAIN AN IMMEDIATE CESSATION OF HOSTILITIES
AND WITHDRAWAL OF FOREIGN FORCES FROM CAMBODIA AND VIETNAM,
AND TO CONSIDER PRACTICAL WAYS TO DEVELOP A CLIMATE CONDUCIVE TO PEACE, SECURITY AND STABILITY. BUT BARTON SAID
IT WOULD BE A MISTAKE TO CONCENTRATE ONLY ON CURRENT OUTBURSTS OF VIOLENCE AND IGNORE OTHER ILLS. CITING CANADA'S
PAST RECORD OF DEPLORING HUMAN RIGHTS DENIALS IN THE REGION
HE CALLED ON THE SC AND THE UN AS A WHOLE TO CONSIDER URGENTLY WHAT MODALITIES MIGHT BE ESTABLISHED TO ALLEVIATE
CONDITIONS WHICH HAVE DRIVEN HUMAN BEINGS TO JOIN THE REFUGEE FLOW. HE THOUGHT THE SYG WAS WELL-PLACED TO PLAY A

USEFUL ROLE IN HELPING TO ESTABLISH THE NECESSARY CONDITIONS
OF PEACE AND SECURITY IN THE REGION. HE HOPED THE SC MIGHT
INVITE THE SYG INFORMALLY &quot;TO EXPLORE POSSIBILITIES THAT
MAY BE OPEN AND ACCEPTABLE TO THOSE MOST DIRECTLY INVOLVED
FOR A POLITICAL MEETING&quot; AIMED AT &quot;TRANSLATING INTO MUTUALLY ACCEPTABLE POLITICAL REALITIES THE ISSUES OF
CONTENTION.&quot;
10. NEW ZEALAND AMB FRANCIS SAID CHINA'S ACTION WAS CLEARLY A REAPONSE TO THE INVASION OF CAMBODIA BY VIETNAM.
THIS WAS NO JUSTIFICATION, HOWEVER, AND FORCES SHOULD BE
WITHDRAWN IMMEDIATELY IN BOTH CASES. CITING THE SOVIETVIETNAMESE FRIENDSHIP TREATY, HE EXPRESSED HOPE THAT STATESMANSHIP WOULD BE EXHIBITED BY WORLD LEADERS SO AS TO
AVOID FURTHER ESCALATION OF VIOLENCE. THERE MUST ALSO BE
EFFORTS TO RESOLVE THE SITUATION PEACEFULLY AND PERMANENTLY.
HIS GOVERNMENT HAD NOTED WITH INTEREST SUGGESTIONS FOR AN
INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE TO REACH AGREEMENT ON GUARANTEEING
THE INDEPENDENCE AND NEUTRALITY OF CAMBODIA. HIS GOVERNMENT BELIEVED SC MEMBERS SHOULD SERIOUSLY CONSIDER PROMOTING DISCUSSIONS BETWEEN THE PARTIES, WHETHER IN A CONFERENCE
UNDER THE COUNCIL'S AEGIS, THROUGH THE SYG'S GOOD OFFICES
OR IN ANY OTHER APPROPRIATE MANNER, TO RESOLVE THE CAMBODIAN PROBLEM. UNTIL IT WAS RESOLVED, TENSION WOULD CONTINUE.

DERED WHY THE CHINESE HAD NOT TAKEN SUCH A STAND REGARDING
THE EUROPEAN ENCLAVES ON CHINESE TERRITORY OR TAIWAN. ROA
KOURI SUGGESTED THAT DENG XIAOPING HAD BEEN &quot;BEWITCHED BY
THE ALMIGHTY DOLLAR&quot; AND HAD SEEN THE POSSIBILITIES OF
&quot;COLLUSION&quot; WITH THE NORTH AMERICAN IMPERIALISTS IN CHINA'S
EFFORTS TO DOMINATE SEA. HOW COULD ONE EXPLAIN CHINA'S
ACTION IMMEDIATELY AFTER DENG'S RETURN IF HE HAD NOT OBTAINED APPROVAL OF WASHINGTON. HE ALLEGED A &quot;DEEP-SEATED
REACTIONARY IDENTITY&quot; BETWEEN WASHINGTON AND PEKING. AFTER
THEIR IGNAMINIOUS DEFEAT THE NORTH AMERICANS ALSO HOPED
TO REGAIN LOST GROUND. ROA KOURI DECLARED THAT CUBA IS
WILLING TO SHED ITS OWN BLOOD FOR VIETNAM. HE ASSERTED
THAT THE PEOPLES OF THE WORLD, PROGRESSIVE FORCES IN ALL
COUNTRIES, THE FATHERLAND OF LENIN, AND ALL THE STATES OF
THE SOCIALIST CAMP SUPPORT VIETNAM IN ITS JUST STRUGGLE
AGAINST THE FOREIGN INVADERS. HE CALLED UPON THE COUNCIL
TO CONDEMN &quot;THIS CRIMINAL ADVENTURE&quot; AND SHOW SOLIDARITY
WITH THE VICTIMS OF AGGRESSION, TO DEMAND THE IMMEDIATE
WITHDRAWAL OF ALL THE INVADING TROOPS OF THE &quot;NEO-FASCIST
CLIQUE OF DENG XIAOPING&quot;, AND THE &quot;PUNISHMENT&quot; CHINA DESERVES.

LONG FOR THE SC TO CONVENE A MEETING, AND LIKENED QUIBBLING
OVER AGENDA WORDING TO THE &quot;HISTORICAL FIDDLING WHILE ROME
BURNED.&quot; FOCUSSING MAINLY ON THE CHINESE ACTION, JAIPAL
NOTED THAT HIS FOREIGN MINISTER &quot;BY AN UNFORTUNATE COINCIDENCE&quot; HAD BEEN IN CHINA AT THE OUTBREAK OF HOSTILITIES
AND HAD PERSONALLY UNDERLINED TO THE CHINESE AUTHORITIES
THE NEED TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM PEACEFULLY. NOTING THAT CHINA
REPORTEDLY HAS DECLARED ITS INTENTION TO WITHDRAW, HE SAW
NO REASON FOR DELAY. HE STRESSED THAT &quot;IT IS IMPERATIVE
THAT THE WITHDRAWAL SHOULD COMMENCE BEFORE THE CONCERNED

REACTION.&quot; HE QUOTED HIS FOREIGN MINISTER'S STATEMENT IN
PARLIAMENT THAT &quot;THE DAYS OF PUNITIVE EXPEDITIONS AND GUNBOAT DIPLOMACY ARE OVER.&quot; AFTER DEVOTING MOST OF HIS
SPEECH TO THE CHINESE ATTACK, JAIPAL STATED THAT BOTH
VIETNAM AND KAMPUCHEA HAVE THE RIGHT TO FULFILL THEIR ASPIRATIONS FREE OF OUTSIDE INTERFERENCE, AND HE REGRETTED THAT
BOTH WERE EMBROILED IN CONFLICTS INVOLVING OUTSIDE FORCES.
HE CALLED FOR A CAREFULLY DRAFTED RESOLUTION WHICH WOULD
PROVIDE FOR A CEASEFIRE, WITHDRAWAL OF TROOPS FROM FOREIGN
TERRITORY, RESPECT FOR THE SOVEREIGNTY AND TERRITORIAL
INTEGRITY OF STATES IN THE AREA, NON-INTERFERENCE IN THE
INTERNAL AFFAIRS OF OTHER STATES IN THE AREA, AND ACCEPTANCE OF THE GOOD OFFICES OF THE SECRETARY GENERAL TO BEGIN
