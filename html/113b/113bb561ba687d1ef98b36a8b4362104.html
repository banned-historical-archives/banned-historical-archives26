		<h3>Tor</h3>
		<p><a href="https://www.torproject.org">Tor</a> is an encrypted anonymising network that makes it harder to intercept internet communications, or see where communications are coming from or going to.</p>
		<p>In order to use the WikiLeaks public submission system as detailed above you can download the Tor Browser Bundle, which is a Firefox-like browser available for Windows, Mac OS X and GNU/Linux and pre-configured to connect using the anonymising system Tor.</p>
		<h4>Tails</h4>
		<p>If you are at high risk and you have the capacity to do so, you can also access the submission system through a secure operating system called <a href="https://tails.boum.org">Tails</a>. Tails is an operating system launched from a USB stick or a DVD that aim to leaves no traces when the computer is shut down after use and automatically routes your internet traffic through Tor. Tails will require you to have either a USB stick or a DVD at least 4GB big and a laptop or desktop computer.</p>

		<h3>Tips</h3>
		<p>Our submission system works hard to preserve your anonymity, but we recommend you also take some of your own precautions. Please review these basic guidelines. </p>
		<div>
			<h4>1. Contact us if you have specific problems</h4>
			<p>If you have a very large submission, or a submission with a complex format, or are a high-risk source, please <a href="#submit_help_contact">contact us</a>. In our experience it is always possible to find a custom solution for even the most seemingly difficult situations.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h4>2. What computer to use</h4>
			<p>If the computer you are uploading from could subsequently be audited in an investigation, consider using a computer that is not easily tied to you. Technical users can also use <a href="https://tails.boum.org">Tails</a> to help ensure you do not leave any records of your submission on the computer.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h4>3. Do not talk about your submission to others</h4>
			<p>If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in source protection – it is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This includes other media organisations.</p>
		</div>

	</div>
</div>

<div id="submit_help_after" class="submit_elem">

			</div>
		</div>

		<h3>After</h3>

		<div>
			<h4>1. Do not talk about your submission to others</h4>
			<p>If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in source protection – it is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This includes other media organisations.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h4>2. Act normal</h4>
			<p>If you are a high-risk source, avoid saying anything or doing anything after submitting which might promote suspicion. In particular, you should try to stick to your normal routine and behaviour.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h4>3. Remove traces of your submission</h4>
			<p>If you are a high-risk source and the computer you prepared your submission on, or uploaded it from, could subsequently be audited in an investigation, we recommend that you format and dispose of the computer hard drive and any other storage media you used.</p>
			<p>In particular, hard drives retain data after formatting which may be visible to a digital forensics team and flash media (USB sticks, memory cards and SSD drives) retain data even after a secure erasure. If you used flash media to store sensitive data, it is important to destroy the media.</p>
			<p>If you do this and are a high-risk source you should make sure there are no traces of the clean-up, since such traces themselves may draw suspicion.</p>
			<div>
				<h4>4. If you face legal action</h4>
				<p>If a legal action is brought against you as a result of your submission, there are organisations that may help you. The Courage Foundation is an international organisation dedicated to the protection of journalistic sources. You can find more details at <a href="https://www.couragefound.org">https://www.couragefound.org</a>.</p>

		<p>WikiLeaks publishes documents of political or historical importance that are censored or otherwise suppressed. We specialise in strategic global publishing and large archives.</p>
		<p>The following is the address of our secure site where you can anonymously upload your documents to WikiLeaks editors. You can only access this submissions system through Tor. (See our <a href="#submit_help_tor">Tor tab</a> for more information.) We also advise you to read our <a href="#submit_help_tips">tips for sources</a> before submitting.</p>

    <br />
   President Asif Ali Zardari on Wednesday strongly condemned the killing of<br />

   Updated from Print edition (below)<br />
    <br />
<br />
   Veteran Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) leader and former lawmaker Waja Ahmad<br />
   Karim Daad was among seven others shot dead in the city on Wednesday.<br />
    <br />
   The fresh spate of violence broke out in the wake of the recovery of five<br />
   bodies of Lyari residents found in gunny bags from various localities in<br />
   the city.<br />
    <br />
   More than a dozen people were injured in the wake of the latest outbreak<br />
   of bloodshed.<br />
    <br />
<br />
   Karim Daad, a former PPP MNA and a popular social worker of the area, was<br />
   targeted by armed men on motorcycles outside a local restaurant in front<br />
   of the Kharadar Jamaat Khana in the limits of the Jackson police station<br />
   just before iftar. Karim Daad and one of his friends were killed on the<br />
   spot.<br />
    <br />
   The police officer investigating the murder, Sub-Inspector Iftikhar told<br />
   The Express Tribune that both Karim Daad and his  friend Sadaruddin<br />
   regularly used to sit together in front of the main gate of the Kharadar<br />
   Jamaat Khana, adding that Karim Daad was shot once in the forehead,<br />
   Sadaruddin was shot in his upper torso.<br />
    <br />
   Deputy Inspector-General (DIG) Shaukat Ali Shah told The Express Tribune<br />
   that the killing of the former legislator was the result of a a**gang war<br />
   between two rival groups in Lyaria**. There is old rivalry between Arshad<br />
   Pappu (currently being run by Ghaffar Zikri) and Rehman Dakait (at<br />
   present, run by Baba Ladla) groups.<br />
    <br />
   a**This is (the outcome of) a chain reaction. These incidents are<br />
   happening in reaction to each other,a** said the DIG.<br />
    <br />
   Attacks, he said, were also mounted against the Salar Compound after the<br />
   bodies of five Baloch men were found. a**God knows what else is to<br />
   follow,a** he said.<br />
    <br />
   DIG Shah confirmed the killing of at least six more people, and said<br />
   nearly a dozen others were injured.<br />
    <br />
   Fierce fighting between the two groups ensued in parts of Lyari, Old City,<br />
   Saddar, Pak Colony and Old Golimar were affected after intense firing<br />
   gripped the areas. Hand grenades were freely used by both the groups in<br />
   the fierce fighting.<br />
    <br />
   Meanwhile, the authorities were unable to take any action and failed to<br />
   enter the affected areas. The bodies stuffed in gunny bags of the five<br />
   Baloch-speaking residents of Lyari, which triggered the violence, were<br />
   found from different areas of the city and all five victims were killed<br />
   after being kidnapped. They were shot multiple times, mostly on their<br />
   heads.<br />
    <br />
   Three of the dead a** who were later identified as Kamran Behram, 26,<br />
   Shahnawaz Buksh, 25, and Saqib Ghani, 24 a** were found within the limits<br />
   of Ferozabad Police Station. All three victims were residents of Sangu<br />
   Lane, Lyari.<br />
    <br />
   Two more bodies, identified as Irfan Baloch and Nadir Baloch, were also<br />
   found from Garden and Preedy, respectively. Following their funeral,<br />
   residents of Lyari took to the streets and staged a demonstration against<br />
   the killings. The protesters, headed by former president of defunct<br />
   Peoples Amn Committee (PAC) Shahid Rehman, then marched towards the chief<br />
   minister house and demanded stern action against the perpetrators.<br />
    <br />
    <br />
   However, the protestors dispersed peacefully after Sindh Information<br />
   Minister Sharjeel Memon pledged to take immediate action over the<br />
   killings.<br />
    <br />
   While returning from the Chief Minister House, a score of unidentified<br />
   persons attacked their rival gang in Old City areas including Salar<br />
   Compound, Bhimpura and the Aqal Bonga area where they hurled nearly a<br />
   dozen hand-grenades and also fired at least two rockets following intense<br />
   firing.<br />
    <br />
   Resultantly, a twelve-year-old girl Esha, daughter of Ramji, and two other<br />
   unidentified persons were killed and nearly half a dozen were injured. At<br />
   least three vehicles were also damaged after catching fire in the rocket<br />
   attacks.<br />
    <br />
   Meanwhile, three people a** including a hosiery shopkeeper Yousuf Sattar<br />
   a** were killed and at least four others were wounded during the firing in<br />
   the Kharadar area.<br />
    <br />
   Sources told The Express Tribune that Salar Compound and its surrounding<br />
   areas were a stronghold of PPP senior activist Akram Baloch and Lyaria**s<br />
   gangsters or the defunct PAC former members believed that Akram was<br />
   supporting their rival Ghaffar Zikri group and attacking them.<br />

   Police in Berlin ask for help as arson attacks on cars continue<br />
<br />
   http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,15322644,00.html<br />
   CRIME | 18.08.2011<br />
<br />
   Cars in Berlin were torched for a third consecutive night<br />
   Police in Berlin have requested federal assistance after unknown vandals<br />
   torched more vehicles for a third consecutive night in the German capital,<br />
   in what the authorities say may be politically motivated attacks.<br />
    <br />
   Another six cars have been torched in the latest in a series of deliberate<br />
   arson attacks in Berlin, prompting local police on Thursday to ask the<br />
   federal government and other states for assistance in finding the<br />
   culprits.<br />
    <br />
   Wednesday's attacks come after a series of car fires Tuesday night, when<br />
   17 vehicles were damaged, and after 11 cars were set alight the day<br />
   before.<br />
    <br />
   Police, who believe the vandalism may be politically motivated, are<br />
   continuing the hunt for an individual or group of unknown offenders who<br />
   are believed to be anarchists or left-wing extremists.<br />
    <br />
   A spokesman for the police union (GdP) said Thursday that federal police<br />
   and officers from other states should be dispatched to the capital for &quot;at<br />
   least six months&quot; to provide support to the local police.<br />
    <br />
   &quot;The assistance is necessary because the Berlin government in the last 10<br />
   years has cut 4,000 police from its staff,&quot; GdP spokesman Michael Purper<br />
   told the Berliner Morgenpost newspaper.<br />
    <br />
   More than 130 vehicles have been torched in the German capital so far this<br />
   year - more than twice the number in all of 2010.<br />
    <br />
   Reward for information<br />
    <br />
   Wednesday's night's arson attacks targeted cars in the Charlottenburg and<br />
   Tiergarten neighborhoods but have occurred in a number of others areas of<br />
   the city in the past three nights. No injuries were reported in any of the<br />
   incidents.<br />
    <br />
   Police and firefighters were first called to a truck fire in the district<br />
   of Spandau on Tuesday evening before tackling the sequence of fires in the<br />
   early hours of Wednesday morning.<br />
    <br />
   On the first night of fires, Berlin's respectable Charlottenburg district<br />
   was the main target. On Monday night, 11 cars were set alight in the area.<br />
   A week earlier more than a dozen cars were damaged or destroyed in similar<br />
   attacks.<br />
    <br />
   Police have struggled to indentify the arsonists, believing the fires to<br />
   be part of a growing trend rather than the actions of an individual. They<br />
   have posted a reward of 5,000 euros ($7,200) for information leading to<br />
   the arrest of the culprits.<br />

   Egyptian official tells Al Hayat that each side insists on the best<br />
   possible outcome for itself, and stresses that Israel and Hamas must make<br />
   concessions.<br />
    By Avi Issacharoff<br />
<br />
   A senior Egyptian official said Thursday that the third round of<br />
   Israel-Hamas indirect talks over the release of abducted Israel Defense<br />
   Forces soldier Gilad Shalit have ceased with no results and without<br />
   setting a date for renewing the negotiations.<br />
<br />
   This comes, according to the source, as a result of both sides' insistence<br />
   on their respective positions.<br />
<br />
   The official told the London-based Arab daily Al-Hayat that Egypt will try<br />
   to find new solutions in the near future that would facilitate the<br />
   completion of a deal on Shalit. The official also said that Hamas leader<br />
   Khaled Meshal, who came to Cairo for the negotiations, did not go into<br />
   details of the talks and just discussed the main principles.<br />
<br />
   &quot;Each of the sides tried to achieve the best possible outcome for itself<br />
   since each party needs to answer to its public and its demands,&quot; the<br />
   Egyptian official said, stressing that &quot;each side must make concessions.&quot;<br />
<br />
   On Wednesday, Al-Hayat quoted Palestinians sources as saying that Hamas<br />
   does not intend to give up on its demand to release Palestinians<br />
   imprisoned in Israel who are considered political leaders .<br />
<br />
   Moreover, a senior Hamas official Osama Hamdan said Tuesday that Israel<br />
   has shown significant flexibility in its stance regarding a prisoner<br />
   exchange deal on captured IDF soldier Gilad Shalit.<br />
<br />
   &quot;Israel's extreme position regarding the deal has become significantly<br />
   more flexible in light of Hamas' resoluteness regarding its position and<br />
   demands,&quot; Hamdan told the newspaper &quot;Palestine&quot;, which is identified with<br />
   the Hamas organization.<br />

   Vietnam issues ultimatum to anti-China protesters<br />

<br />
   Hanoi - Vietnamese authorities on Thursday warned the public to stop<br />
   protesting against China, saying 'hostile forces' were trying to damage<br />
   relations between the two countries, Hanoi's People's Committee said in a<br />
   statement Thursday.<br />
   The committee asked people 'to stop gathering, marching and forming<br />
   spontaneous protests' in the capital after anti-China protests met for the<br />
   tenth time in 11 weeks at the weekend.<br />
   The marches stemmed from people's patriotism and frustration, the<br />
   statement said, adding: 'Recently, hostile forces from inside and outside<br />
   the countries have been inciting people to demonstrate to cause public<br />
   disorder in Hanoi.'<br />
   It said the protests caused political instability and had a negative<br />
   impact on the state's external relations.<br />
   Authorities would allow 'necessary measures' against those who did not<br />
   comply with the warning.<br />
   The protests have been calling for an end to perceived Chinese aggression<br />
   in the South China Sea, parts of which are claimed by both countries.<br />
   They were sparked when Chinese patrol vessels cut the cables of a<br />
   Vietnamese seismic survey ship in the area and harassed another one.<br />
   The territorial dispute centres on the potentially mineral-rich Spratly<br />
   islands, which are also claimed by Malaysia, Brunei, Taiwan and the<br />
   Philippines.<br />

   Azerbaijan, Baku, Aug.18 / Trend, M. Aliyev /<br />
<br />
   The frequency of drug trafficking attempts between Iran and Azerbaijan has<br />
   increased, Azerbaijani State Border Service Chief Elchin Guliyev said on<br />
   Thursday.<br />
<br />
   &quot;Despite the growth of such attempts, Azerbaijani border guards and other<br />
   personnel successfully prevent the incidents from taking place&quot;, Guliyev<br />
   said.<br />
   He said the Azerbaijani border guards also possess modern equipment used<br />
   worldwide by state border guards.<br />
<br />
   &quot;As a result, approximately 90 percent of illegal border crossing attempts<br />
   have been prevented in recent years. This is a very serious indicator for<br />
   combating international terrorism, illegal migration, and drug trafficking<br />
   on a global scale&quot;, Guliyev said.<br />
<br />
   He added that the infrastructure for border protection in Azerbaijan has<br />
   been equipped to the highest degree in recent years.<br />

   SANAA, Aug. 17 (Xinhua) -- Militants of the Yemen-based al- Qaida wing<br />
   Wednesday regained control of the country's strategic coastal city of<br />
   Shaqra in southern Abyan province after days of fierce battles against<br />
   government troops, a provincial security official said.<br />

   Pakistan says it can bring Haqqani to peace talks<br />
   APBy KATHY GANNON | AP a** 1 hr 27 mins ago<br />
<br />
   http://news.yahoo.com/pakistan-says-bring-haqqani-peace-talks-064051883.html<br />
<br />
   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) a** Pakistan's military says it can bring the<br />
   notorious Haqqani militant network, considered one of the most lethal<br />
   threats against U.S.-led coalition troops in Afghanistan, to the<br />
   negotiation table.<br />
<br />
   Instead, Washington is pushing Pakistan to carry out military assaults<br />
   against Haqqani hideouts in the tribal regions.<br />
<br />
   The network is affiliated with the Taliban and al-Qaida and blamed for<br />
   most of the major attacks in Afghanistan, particularly the often brazen<br />
   assaults on the capital Kabul. It has been described as the glue that<br />
   binds together the militant groups operating in Pakistan's tribal North<br />
   Waziristan.<br />
<br />
   &quot;The Haqqani network has been more important to the development and<br />
   sustainment of al-Qaida and the global jihad than any other single actor<br />
   or group,&quot; a study released earlier this month by West Point's Combatting<br />
   Terrorism Center said.<br />
<br />
   A senior Pakistani military officer now says that Pakistan can deliver the<br />
   Haqqani network to the negotiation table. Pakistan has kept open<br />
   communication lines with Jalaluddin Haqqani, the elderly leader of the<br />
   al-Qaida aligned network. The officer spoke on the condition of anonymity<br />
   because he was not authorized to release the information.<br />
<br />
   The officer denied U.S. and Afghan allegations that Islamabad is aiding<br />
   and arming the network.<br />
<br />
   But delivering the Haqqanis would guarantee the Pakistanis a major role in<br />
   negotiations to end the war and shore up their influence in Afghanistan<br />
   after the Americans have gone.<br />
<br />
   Pakistan's offer to bring the recalcitrant Haqqani and his son Sirajuddin,<br />
   the network's military chief, to the peace table comes amid accelerated<br />
   efforts to find a negotiated end to the protracted Afghan war ahead of the<br />
   2014 U.S. military pullout.<br />
<br />
   But Washington wants Pakistan to go after the Haqqanis because they are<br />
   threatening coalition forces in Afghanistan.<br />
<br />
   During a visit to Afghanistan earlier this month, Joint Chiefs Chairman<br />
   Adm. Mike Mullen bristled at Pakistan's reluctance to clear out safe<br />
   havens on its territory.<br />
<br />
   &quot;There has been frustration with the speed with which that (safe havens)<br />
   has been addressed ... because in particular, the Haqqani network, which<br />
   continues to be central to this, not exclusive, but central, in feeding<br />
   this fight in Afghanistan,&quot; he said. &quot;At some point that has got to stop.<br />
   We continue to engage on that, to bring pressure on that, but I would be<br />
   hard pressed to be able to tell you time and place when it is going to<br />
   happen, but it needs to happen.&quot;<br />
<br />
   The senior Pakistani officer said a military assault on Haqqani hideouts<br />
   would quickly engulf the entire tribal region in a war that the Pakistan<br />
   army can't win.<br />
<br />
   For years, the dilemma of how to deal with the Haqqani network has<br />
   bedeviled Pakistan's relationship with both the United States and<br />
   Afghanistan.<br />
<br />
   Pakistan sees the Haqqanis as allies in a postwar Afghanistan. Deep links<br />
   were found by the West Point study between the Haqqani network and<br />
   Pakistan's intelligence agency, known as ISI.<br />
<br />
   Maj. Gen. Daniel Allyn, the coalition's commander for eastern Afghanistan,<br />
   recently called the Haqqani network &quot;enemy Number One&quot;, ahead of the<br />
   Taliban's one-eyed leader Mullah Mohammed Omar.<br />
<br />
   On Tuesday, the U.S. designated Mullah Sangeen Zadran, a commander in the<br />
   Haqqani network, as a terrorist, freezing any assets he has in the United<br />
   States and barring Americans from doing business with him.<br />
<br />
   Skeptical of Haqqani's willingness to negotiate, Allyn also complained<br />
   about safe havens in Pakistan.<br />
<br />
   &quot;From what I've seen from Haqqani so far, their ruthless tactics and the<br />
   way they have senselessly murdered by the hundreds Afghan citizens, it's<br />
   hard for me to imagine that (reconciliation) is very high on their list<br />
   right now, particularly as long as they have the safe haven they enjoy in<br />
   Miram Shah,&quot; Allyn told the online Long War Journal in an Aug. 9<br />
   interview.<br />
<br />
   Miram Shah, North Waziristan's capital, has been the target of numerous<br />
   U.S. drone assaults, as have nearby areas suspected of concealing<br />
   insurgent hideouts.<br />
<br />
   Haqqani's religious school, or madrassa, has been hit several times and<br />
   several insurgents have been killed.<br />
<br />
   Yet people in the area say dozens of militants still roam the area with<br />
   relative ease, including Arab Al-Qaida fighters and members of the<br />
   Uzbek-dominated Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan.<br />
<br />
   U.S. demands for Pakistan to launch military operations against Haqqani<br />
   havens have escalated as the U.S. and NATO prepare to deploy more troops<br />
   to the eastern border regions, analysts and Western officials say.<br />
<br />
   Ahead of his departure last month as head of Afghanistan's military<br />
   operation, Gen. David Patraeus announced that the thrust of the war would<br />
   be redirected against Taliban hideouts in the east of Afghanistan, where<br />
   Haqqani's Afghan headquarters is located.<br />
<br />
   Yet at least two Western officials in the region say Haqqani's network<br />
   cannot be defeated militarily. Speaking on condition of anonymity to allow<br />
   them to speak candidly, the two officials, both of whom have Western<br />
   military experience, said Pakistan's soldiers are poorly trained and<br />
   equipped. A military operation in North Waziristan's Miram Shah would<br />
   temporarily disrupt Haqqani's operation but not defeat it, they said.<br />
<br />
   They also said the calls for attacks on Haqqani safe havens in Miram Shah<br />
   are part of the larger U.S. strategy that uses military pressure to bring<br />
   insurgents to the negotiation table.<br />
<br />
   Pakistan has 140,000 soldiers deployed in its tribal regions. Battles with<br />
   Pakistani insurgents there have resulted in the deaths of more than 3,000<br />
   Pakistani soldiers, more than the U.S. and NATO combined.<br />
<br />
   According to the Pakistani military officer, an all out war with the<br />
   Haqqani network would result in numerous military deaths and leave<br />
   Pakistan, battered by relentless suicide bombings, vulnerable to more<br />
   militant attacks.<br />
<br />
   Insisting Pakistan can bring the Haqqanis to the table without a military<br />
   operation, the Pakistani senior military official says it's still not<br />
   clear what the Haqqanis could be offered if they agree to open talks.<br />
<br />
   Mohammed Ismai Qasemyar, a representative of Afghanistan's High Peace<br />
   Council tasked with finding a peaceful end to the 10-year war, said: &quot;We<br />
   won't make any deals with Haqqani.&quot; The only promises on offer so far are<br />
   personal security guarantees and &quot;every rights granted all Afghan<br />
   citizens.&quot;<br />
<br />
   On their part, Haqqanis would have to denounce al-Qaida, he said.<br />

    Report on video of Pakistani teenagers terror training in North          <br />
    Waziristan                                                               <br />
                                                                             <br />
    Text of report by Amir Mir headlined &quot;Video of Jehadi training in NWA    <br />
    released&quot; published by Pakistani newspaper The News website on 17 August <br />
                                                                             <br />
    Lahore: The notion that the North Waziristan Agency continues to be used <br />
    by Al-Qa'idah and Taleban elements for terrorist training activities has <br />
    again been confirmed with the release of a fresh video of the Pakistani  <br />
    teenagers being trained in NWA.                                          <br />
                                                                             <br />
    The seven-minute-long video, which is titled 'Cubs of Waziristan,' has   <br />
    been released on jihadi websites by the Al Ansar Mailing List. An edited <br />
    version of the video and the translation has been provided by the SITE   <br />
    Intelligence Group. The location of the training camp seems to be the    <br />
    Mirali area of North Waziristan, which serves as a haven for the         <br />
    fugitive al-Qaeda and Taleban leadership. Coming back to the             <br />
    seven-minute-long video, titled 'Cubs of Waziristan,' it shows a group   <br />
    of 16 teenage jihadis, including six trainers armed with assault rifles  <br />
    and ten young recruits who are standing in a half circle. An older       <br />
    fighter, who seems to be their trainer or leader, is shown citing a      <br />
    verse from the Holy Quran that says Muslims must prepare for war against <br />
    'the enemy of Allah and your enemy'.                                     <br />
                                                                             <br />
    &quot;In obedience of this divine command, we are preparing militarily and    <br />
    Shariah and faith-wise,&quot; the fighter is shown as saying. &quot;In this way,   <br />
    we are erasing ages of humiliation that we tasted and in which we grew   <br />
    up. At times we were scared of match sticks, and now, thanks to Allah,   <br />
    here are the children of the Muslims getting trained in weapons that US  <br />
    Special Forces are trained to use. This is an embodiment of the          <br />
    extirpation of the defeatist moral that was planted in the Islamic Ummah <br />
    [community].                                                             <br />
                                                                             <br />
    &quot;The young Pakistani children are then seen undergoing firearms training <br />
    with pistols, assault rifles, and machine guns. The boys are conducting  <br />
    shooting drills in lanes, with paper targets tacked up on posts. A few   <br />
    of the smaller kids are seen having difficulty handling the recoil of    <br />
    the assault rifles. The video ends with the trainers and the young       <br />
    recruits, who are now armed with assault rifles, standing in line,       <br />
    raising their weapons, and shouting &quot;Allah Almighty is Great&quot;.           <br />
                                                                             <br />
    Located between eastern Afghanistan and northwest Pakistan, the North    <br />
    Waziristan Agency also provides shelter to many anti-American terrorist  <br />
    organisations such as the Haqqani Network, the Tehrik-e-Taleban          <br />
    Pakistan, the Islamic Jihad Union, the Islamic Army of Great Britain,    <br />
    the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan, the Lashkar-e-Jhangvi, the Harkatul  <br />
    Jehadul Islami, the Jamaat-ul-Furqaan, the Fidayeen-e-Islami, as well as <br />
    the splinter groups of the Harkatul Mujahideen (HuM), the                <br />
    Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) and the Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), among others.      <br />
                                                                             <br />
    Many of the terrorist attacks targeting the American and Western         <br />
    installations and individuals in Pakistan as well as the headquarters of <br />
    the Pakistani security and intelligence interests, had been jointly      <br />
    planned by Al-Qa'idah and the TTP in North Waziristan. At the same time, <br />
    much of Al-Qa'idah's most wanted core leadership remains in the Mirali,  <br />
    Miramshah and Datta Khel areas of North Waziristan and continues to      <br />
    mastermind bloody acts of terrorism on both sides of the Pakistan-Afghan <br />
    border. The US considers the Haqqani Network and its role in the         <br />
    insurgency in Afghanistan among the most difficult challenges the ISAF   <br />
    faces, but has so far simply failed to convince the Pakistani military   <br />
    establishment to take action against the Haqqani Network's safe havens   <br />
    on the Pakistani soil.                                                   <br />
                                                                             <br />
    The Americans maintain that the North Waziristan has become a hub of the <br />
    anti-US elements given the fact that it has a common border with Khost,  <br />
    the native Afghan province of Jalaluddin Haqqani.                        <br />
                                                                             <br />
    However, the Pakistani military authorities, despite intense US          <br />
    pressure, have so far shown reluctance to carry out a full-fledged       <br />
    military operation in North Waziristan. They have been insisting that    <br />
    military operations against the militants would be undertaken at the     <br />
    timing of its own choosing and at a scale in keeping with its strength   <br />
    of manpower and military hardware. On the other hand, the American       <br />
    drones have targeted the North Waziristan extensively since the dawn of  <br />
    2010, especially after a suicide bomber killed seven CIA officers in the <br />
    Khost area of Afghanistan on December                31, 2009 by         <br />
    exploding himself inside the CIA facility.                               <br />
                                                                             <br />

    Five members of the military, two of whom are generals, were arrested    <br />
    late on Wednesday [17 August] as part of an investigation into documents <br />
    seized in Golcuk concerning the alleged Sledgehammer coup plot.          <br />
                                                                             <br />
    While Gen Ridvan Uluguler, Brig Gen Kubilay Baloglu, Col Ibrahim Kocer,  <br />
    Col Cuneyt Kusmez and Col Ismet Cinki, who came to the courthouse in     <br />
    Besiktas Wednesday morning to testify, were arrested, Col Erhan Sensoy,  <br />
    and civil servant Gullu Salkaya were released pending trial.             <br />
                                                                             <br />
    The officers were questioned by prosecutor Huseyin Ayar about the        <br />
    documents that had been seized from the Golcuk Naval Base in December of <br />
    last year.                                                               <br />

    The documents are thought to belong to the Sledgehammer plan, a coup     <br />
    plot supposedly devised at a military gathering in 2003 that allegedly   <br />
    sought to weaken the government in order to lay the groundwork for a     <br />
    military takeover.                                                       <br />

    The Sledgehammer coup plot was allegedly developed with the aim to oust  <br />
    the Justice and Development Party (AK Party) government through acts of  <br />
    violence. According to the Sledgehammer plan, the military was to        <br />
    systematically foment chaos in society with violent acts, including      <br />
    planned bomb attacks on the Fatih and Beyazit mosques in Istanbul.       <br />

   UN rights chief to call for ICC Syria probe, sources say<br />
<br />
   http://www.nowlebanon.com/NewsArticleDetails.aspx?ID=301893<br />
<br />
   August 18, 2011<br />
<br />
   The UN human rights chief will call for the international war crimes court<br />
   to investigate Syria's deadly crackdown at a UN Security Council meeting<br />
   on Thursday, diplomatic sources said.<br />
<br />
   The 15-nation council is to meet on the Syria crisis amid growing concern<br />
   over President Bashar al-Assad's military assault on pro-democracy<br />
   protests, which is said to have killed about 2,000 people in five months.<br />
<br />
   UN Human Rights Commissioner Navi Pillay and humanitarian chief Valerie<br />
   Amos are to give details of latest events in the strife-torn country at<br />
   the briefing.<br />
<br />
   Pillay's report will say there is &quot;evidence that Syria has committed grave<br />
   violations of international human rights law,&quot; said one diplomat with<br />
   knowledge of the report.<br />
<br />
   Pillay wants &quot;a thorough, appropriate, international investigation&quot; of the<br />
   crackdown, the diplomat told AFP, speaking on condition of anonymity.<br />
<br />
   The UN rights official &quot;is likely to suggest that the International<br />
   Criminal Court would be appropriate,&quot; added another diplomatic source.<br />
<br />
   The UN human rights department &quot;is expected to conclude that the<br />
   allegations are so serious, and credible, that national level<br />
   investigation conducted by the Syrians will be insufficient,&quot; added the<br />
   source.<br />
<br />
   Only the Security Council can refer the Syria case to the ICC, which is<br />
   based in The Hague.<br />
<br />
   Earlier this year the international body said the court should investigate<br />
   events in Libya and the ICC issued arrest warrants in June for Libyan<br />
   leader Moammar Qaddafi, his son and a close associate.<br />
<br />
   The Security Council has also referred Sudan's President Omar al-Bashir to<br />
   the ICC over the Darfur conflict. Bashir is now wanted on genocide and<br />
   crimes against humanity charges.<br />
<br />
   The European Union and United States has stepped up pressure on Assad's<br />
   government with mounting sanctions moves. The Western powers face<br />
   opposition in the Security Council to new sanctions from Russia, China and<br />
   the emerging powers: Brazil, India and South Africa.<br />
<br />
   UN humanitarian chief Amos is negotiating with the Syrian government to<br />
   let a humanitarian aid team assess the extent of the crisis in the<br />
   country.<br />
<br />
   UN leader Ban Ki-moon spoke to Assad on Wednesday to reinforce the case, a<br />
   UN spokesperson said.<br />
<br />
   Assad first promised the UN secretary general in April that his government<br />
   would negotiate a UN mission.<br />
<br />
   Amos told reporters she hoped the humanitarian team would get into Syria<br />
<br />
   &quot;We hope that we are very nearly at the point where a mission will be able<br />
   to go in and we will be able to make assessments,&quot; she told reporters.<br />
<br />
   The UN under secretary general said it would be a &quot;priority&quot; to get<br />
   unconditional access to Syrian towns that have been the target of attacks<br />
   by Assad's military. But she said negotiations were still going on.<br />
<br />
   The UN Security Council meeting starts at 1900 GMT on Thursday and will<br />
   almost certainly be behind closed doors.<br />

   Disbelief at violence of 'volunteers'<br />
<br />
   By Xu Chi  |   2011-8-18  |     NEWSPAPER EDITION<br />
   The story appears on Page A4<br />
   Aug 18, 2011<br />
<br />
   http://www.shanghaidaily.com/article/?id=480158&amp;type=Metro<br />
<br />
   THE 58-year-old unlicensed fruit stall vendor recalled the scene from<br />
   Tuesday evening when, carrying her eight-month-old grandson, she ran to<br />
   escape desperately from 30-plus armed men who chased and beat them with<br />
   long steel bars.<br />
<br />
   &quot;They chased us all the way and beat every stall vendor in sight, from<br />
   young men to old women, even those who were lying on the ground, and then<br />
   another white van came only to send more to block our way,&quot; said the<br />
   vendor surnamed Zhang, a Hunan Province native.<br />
<br />
   She was one of the 10 unlicensed vendors engaged in a fierce clash with<br />
   the armed men about 7pm Tuesday at the intersection of Ningxia Road and<br />
   Kaixuan Road in Putuo District. Four vendors were hospitalized after the<br />
   fight.<br />
<br />
   But, in a stunning statement, police claimed that the armed men who<br />
   dressed in green army uniforms were &quot;urban management volunteers&quot; seeking<br />
   only to help the community, not thugs hired by the urban management team,<br />
   as the victim vendors assumed.<br />
<br />
   Putuo police released an official announcement saying that the clash<br />
   started when the volunteers tried to crack down on the unlicensed street<br />
   vendors, while Putuo Urban Management Team officials told Shanghai Daily<br />
   that the volunteers were working on their own and had nothing to do with<br />
   the team.<br />
<br />
   The title of &quot;volunteer&quot; immediately sparked doubts among the vendors and<br />
   motorcyclists who witnessed the violence on the street.<br />
<br />
   &quot;So what kind of volunteers would carry 1-meter-long iron bars, act so<br />
   violently to beat women, and run away when police come?&quot; asked a<br />
   motorcyclist surnamed Wu from Anhui Province.<br />
<br />
   Wu said the accident started when 10-plus armed men arrived on electronic<br />
   mopeds with the word &quot;Putuo&quot; on the vehicles. He said the men insulted the<br />
   vendors with dirty words and then started beating them, while some angry<br />
   vendors called on their family members, including women and children, to<br />
   fight back.<br />
<br />
   Wu said one of the armed men called for reinforcements via cellphone and<br />
   soon another van arrived. They dropped their weapons and fled when police<br />
   arrived.<br />
<br />
   A crowd of over 100 residents witnessed the scene and showed their anger<br />
   by taking pictures of the fight and uploading them online.<br />
<br />
   Vendor Zhang said she saw a male vendor bleeding from his head and his<br />
   wife lying unconscious on the ground after the combat.<br />
<br />
   Zhang said this was not the first time that the armed men had tried to do<br />
   the jobs of the urban management team to crack down on the vendors, but<br />
   violence had not been used before.<br />
<br />
   &quot;Once a 'volunteer' told me that he earns 1,500 yuan from the sub-district<br />
   government to supervise the illegal businesses,&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
   An official surnamed Su with an office that's supposed to supervise the<br />
   volunteers denied the existence of such &quot;volunteers&quot; and told Shanghai<br />
   Daily that they had never recruited such people.<br />
<br />
   Su said the office was still seeking the armed men's true identities.<br />

   Defense Ministry plans its version of Global Hawk aircraft<br />
<br />

<br />
   The Defense Ministry, acting at the behest of Prime Minister Naoto Kan, is<br />
   set to begin a study into the development of an unmanned reconnaissance<br />
   aircraft, sources said.<br />
<br />
   Kan gave instructions to proceed after high altitude unmanned<br />
   reconnaissance Global Hawk aircraft used by the U.S. military proved<br />
   effective in gathering information about conditions at the quake-stricken<br />
   Fukushima No. 1 nuclear power plant following the March 11 disaster.<br />
<br />
   Funds will be earmarked for this project in either the third supplementary<br />
   budget or the budget for fiscal 2012. The amount will greatly exceed the<br />
   allocation in the current fiscal year budget.<br />
<br />
   The Defense Ministry has tried to develop small unmanned aircraft in the<br />
   past.<br />
<br />
   Between fiscal 2004 and 2010, about 10 billion yen ($128 million) was<br />
   spent on developing a multipurpose, small unmanned jet. Although four<br />
   prototypes were constructed, two were lost after crashing into the ocean<br />
   due to engine trouble during test flights.<br />
<br />
   The failure to produce a viable aircraft led to a sharp reduction in study<br />
   expenses for such development in the current fiscal year. Just 1 million<br />
   yen was allocated for this purpose.<br />
<br />
   The decision to greatly increase the study expenses will also cover the<br />
   cost of research and development of robot technology.<br />
<br />
   While Defense Ministry officials will initially focus on developing a<br />
   reconnaissance aircraft that can be used by Self-Defense Forces members<br />
   when they are dispatched to assist in disaster relief operations, there is<br />
   a possibility that subsequent development could focus on converting the<br />
   technology for military use.<br />
<br />
   Kan gave the instructions to develop an unmanned vehicle at a July 1<br />
   luncheon at the Prime Minister's Official Residence.<br />
<br />
   Among the participants were Defense Minister Toshimi Kitazawa and Gen.<br />
   Eiji Kimizuka, who at that time was head of the Northeastern Army and in<br />
   charge of SDF disaster relief operations in the Tohoku region following<br />
   the Great East Japan Earthquake. Kimizuka is now GSDF chief of staff.<br />
<br />
   Pointing to the contributions of the Global Hawk, Kan said, &quot;Japan has<br />
   advanced technology in robotics and radio-controlled equipment. I want the<br />
   Defense Ministry to develop Japan's own unmanned vehicle.&quot;<br />
<br />
   In dealing with the Fukushima nuclear accident, consideration had been<br />
   given at one time to using an unmanned helicopter used by the GSDF to<br />
   observe what was occurring by remote control. However, the idea was never<br />
   implemented because as one high-ranking Defense Ministry official put it,<br />
   &quot;It was not at a level of practical use so we could not make a decision to<br />
   use it in circumstances that did not allow for any error.&quot;<br />
<br />
   The U.S. military received a request from the Japanese government and<br />
   dispatched a Global Hawk from Andersen Air Force Base on Guam. The vehicle<br />
   was used for reconnaissance flights over the disaster-stricken areas of<br />
   the Tohoku region as well as the Fukushima No. 1 nuclear power plant.<br />
<br />
   Video images taken by a camera on board were passed to Japan.<br />
<br />
   Analysis of the images provided confirmation that the storage pool for<br />
   spent nuclear fuel in the No. 4 reactor at the plant was empty of water.<br />
   That and other information was relayed to Japanese officials.<br />

   Kidnapped American: US mission chief seeks quick recovery<br />

<br />
   ISLAMABAD:  <br />
   The United States urged Pakistani authorities on Wednesday to quickly<br />
   recover its national Warren Weinstein who was kidnapped from his Lahore<br />
   residence on Saturday.<br />
    <br />
   The matter was raised by US Ambassador Cameron Munter, who held separate<br />
   meetings with Foreign Minister Hina Rabbani Khar and Foreign Secretary<br />
   Salman Bashir.<br />
    <br />
   Officials told The Express Tribune that Munter pressed Pakistani<br />
   authorities to recover the American aid expert, who was abducted at<br />
   gunpoint by unidentified persons.<br />
    <br />
   The US embassy spokesperson confirmed the meeting but declined from<br />
   sharing any details. The police have so far uncovered no clue into the<br />
   kidnapping that saw Weinstein struck on the head with a pistol and driven<br />
   off from his home.<br />
    <br />
   There have been no claims of responsibility and the most officers have<br />
   been able to establish is that he was targeted because of his nationality.<br />
    <br />
   According to AFP, Weinstein travelled widely in the country, working on<br />
   projects that focused on private-sector development and economic growth<br />
   and visited only safe parts of the northwest, where the Taliban and al<br />
   Qaeda-linked groups have bases.<br />
    <br />
   One of his colleagues told AFP that his contract was expiring on August 15<br />
   and he was expected to leave Pakistan by the end of this month.<br />
    <br />
   A statement issued by the foreign ministry did not touch upon the subject.<br />
    <br />
   a**The two sides discussed bilateral relations and underscored the<br />
   importance of the Pakistan-US strategic relationship based on mutual<br />
   respect and mutual interests,a** it added after the meeting between Munter<br />
   and Khar.<br />
    <br />
   Both sides, it said, agreed to bolster cooperation between the two<br />
   countries in various fields and also called for enhanced convergence on<br />
   regional issues.<br />

   Syria's Assad says stops police operations-UN<br />
<br />
   18 Aug 2011 03:53<br />
<br />
   http://www.trust.org/alertnet/news/syrias-assad-says-stops-police-operations-un/<br />
<br />
   UNITED NATIONS, Aug 17 (Reuters) - Syrian President Bashar al-Assad told<br />
   U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon that military and police operations<br />
   against pro-democracy protesters had stopped, the United Nations said on<br />
   Wednesday.<br />
<br />
   In a phone call with Assad on Wednesday, Ban &quot;expressed alarm at the<br />
   latest reports of continued widespread violations of human rights and<br />
   excessive use of force by Syrian security forces against civilians across<br />
   Syria, including in the Al Ramel district of Latakia , home to several<br />
   thousands of Palestinian refugees,&quot; the United Nations said in a<br />
   statement.<br />
<br />
   &quot;The Secretary-General emphasized that all military operations and mass<br />
   arrests must cease immediately. President Assad said that the military and<br />
   police operations had stopped,&quot; the statement added.<br />
<br />
   Residents of the besieged port city of Latakia said on Wednesday that<br />
   Syrian forces raided houses in a Sunni district, arresting hundreds of<br />
   people and taking them to a stadium after a four-day tank assault to crush<br />
   protests against al-Assad.<br />
<br />
   Assad's forces attacked al-Raml, a seafront area named after a Palestinian<br />
   refugee camp built in the 1950s, on the weekend as part of a fierce<br />
   campaign to crush a five-month-old uprising.<br />
<br />
   Latakia is of particular significance to Assad, from Syria's minority<br />
   Alawite community. The 45-year-old president, a self-declared champion of<br />
   the Palestinian cause, comes from a village to the southeast, where his<br />
   father is buried. The Assad family, along with friends, control the city's<br />
   port and its finances.<br />
<br />
   Syria has expelled most independent media since the unrest began, making<br />
   it difficult to verify reports from the country.<br />
<br />
   HUMANITARIAN MISSION<br />
<br />
   The U.N. statement said Ban repeated his calls for an independent<br />
   investigation into all reported killings and acts of violence, and for<br />
   free access by the media.<br />
<br />
   It added the U.N. chief called on Damascus to cooperate fully with the<br />
   Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights.<br />
<br />
   &quot;The Secretary-General also urged president Assad to engage in a credible<br />
   and peaceful process of reform towards comprehensive change,&quot; the<br />
   statement said.<br />
<br />
   Assad enumerated the reforms he will undertake in the next few months,<br />
   including revision of the Constitution and the holding of parliamentary<br />
   elections, the statement said.<br />
<br />
   &quot;The Secretary-General emphasized the need for reforms to be implemented<br />
   swiftly without further military intervention,&quot; it said<br />
<br />
   Ban said a U.N. humanitarian assessment team, which the Syrian Government<br />
   had agreed to receive, should be given independent and unhindered access<br />
   to all areas affected by violence. Assad said the team would have access<br />
   to different sites in Syria, according to the statement.<br />
<br />
   The U.N. human rights chief is expected to suggest that the Security<br />
   Council refer Syria's crackdown on protesters to the International<br />
   Criminal Court, envoys said on Wednesday.<br />
<br />
   U.N. human rights chief Navi Pillay will address the 15-nation council in<br />
   a closed-door session on Syria on Thursday, along with U.N. humanitarian<br />
   chief Valerie Amos. (Reporting by Peter Cooney, editing by Philip Barbara)<br />

   Ethnic tensions remain tense in Osh: Otunbayeva<br />

<br />
   BISHKEK, Aug. 17 (Xinhua) -- Kyrgyz President for the interim period Roza<br />
   Otunbayeva warned on Wednesday that there are still continued tensions in<br />
   southern Kyrgyzstan.<br />
<br />
   &quot;The situation in Osh remains tense,&quot; the president said at a meeting with<br />
   local council members in Osh.<br />
<br />
   &quot;The situation has long stabilized in Jalal-Abad, life is back to normal<br />
   there, but in Osh, tensions have not reduced for some reason,&quot; she said.<br />
<br />
   Otunbayeva urged local council members &quot;to use their authority and<br />
   influence to foster peace-building in the city.&quot;<br />
<br />
   &quot;I am urging you to consider comprehensive measures on how to resolve the<br />
   situation. All schools should be inspected before the start of the<br />
   academic year, to check the situation to make sure that there is no<br />
   division or discrimination on the grounds of ethnicity,&quot; the president<br />
   said.<br />
<br />
   &quot;We must all join efforts to reduce this tension in inter- ethnic<br />
   relations,&quot; she added.<br />
<br />
   The Osh and Jalal-Abad regions in southern Kyrgyzstan were hit by ethnic<br />
   clashes between Kyrgyz and Uzbeks in June 2010. 435 people died and over<br />
   2,000 were injured in the clashes, according to official figures.<br />

   U.S. sends two more Predator drones to Libya<br />
   Wed Aug 17, 2011 10:47pm GMT<br />
    <br />
   http://af.reuters.com/article/commoditiesNews/idAFN1E77G1KU20110817?sp=true<br />
<br />
   WASHINGTON Aug 17 (Reuters) - The United States has deployed two more<br />
   Predator drones for surveillance operations over Libya, a U.S. official<br />
   told Reuters on Wednesday, as Muammar Gaddafi's forces face unprecedented<br />
   pressure.<br />
<br />
   The drones arrived earlier this week, the official said, speaking on<br />
   condition of anonymity. It was not immediately clear how many U.S. drones<br />
   were currently deployed on the NATO mission.<br />
<br />
   The U.S. decision to send additional drones follows calls last month by<br />
   NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen for members of the alliance<br />
   to provide more air support and comes as Libyan rebels make key advances<br />
   across the country.<br />
<br />
   After 41 years of supreme power, 69-year-old Gaddafi seems isolated. Rebel<br />
   forces are closing in from the west, south and east, cutting off his<br />
   Tripoli stronghold on the Mediterranean shore. Gaddafi's whereabouts are<br />
   not known.<br />
<br />
   U.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta said on Tuesday Gaddafi's days<br />
   appeared numbered and U.S. officials are citing rebel battlefield<br />
   advances, diplomatic pressure and defections among Gaddafi's inner circle<br />
   as evidence of progress. (Reporting by Phil Stewart; editing by Todd<br />

   Around 13 fighters killed in Russian Caucasus<br />
<br />
   http://www.kyivpost.com/news/russia/detail/111079/<br />
<br />
   Today at 11:26     | Associated Press<br />
   MAKHACHKALA, Russia (AP) a** Russian police say 13 insurgents have been<br />
   killed in the country's volatile Caucasus region, including four in an<br />
   operation commanded by Chechnya's president, himself a former rebel.    <br />
<br />
   A spokesman for the Interior Ministry in the republic, Magomed Deniev,<br />
   said four rebels were killed Thursday in the capital Grozny in the<br />
   operation commanded by Ramzan Kadyrov.<br />
<br />
   He says seven others were killed in an operation in Chechnya's mountainous<br />
   south, where insurgents shelter in the rugged territory.<br />
<br />
   It was an unusually high one-day death toll for Chechnya, where<br />
   separatists have been less active than neighboring Dagestan.<br />
<br />
   Dagestan interior ministry spokesman Vyacheslav Gananov says two<br />
   insurgents were killed by police during the night in the Dagestani capital<br />
   Makhachkala after opening fire on police who stopped their car.<br />

<br />
   The wanted head of banned militant outfit Harkat-ul-Jihad al-Islami<br />
   (Huji), Moulana Yahiya, has been arrested along with his two accomplices<br />
   in Bhairab upazila of Kishoreganj early Thursday.<br />
<br />
   Rab (Rapid Action Battalion) arrested the three intercepting a<br />
   Kishoreganj-bound passenger bus from Sylhet, Maj Walid Hossain of legal<br />
   and media wing of the Rab told The Daily Star.<br />
<br />
   Yahiya is wanted in several major militant attacks, including the August<br />
   21 grenade attack, Ramna Batamul blast and Kotalipara bomb planting.<br />
<br />
   A top Rab official identified the two others as Mohammad Bahauddin, 22,<br />
   and Yar Mohammad, 50.<br />
<br />
   Describing the operation, a Rab official, seeking anonymity, said the<br />
   elite force had a tip-off that the trio were heading towards Kishoreganj<br />
   in a passenger bus that left Sylhet the same night.<br />
<br />
   Accordingly, they intercepted several buses at Durjoy intersection in<br />
   Bhairab and found them in a bus around 2:15am.<br />
<br />
   The Rab official said they had recovered some training manuals of the<br />
   outfit and books on jihad from their possessions.<br />
<br />
   Yahiya fought in Afghanistan and also against Myanmar forces for the<br />
   Arakan Muslims.<br />
<br />
   Yahiya took charge of the outfit after the arrest of its former chief<br />
   Mufti Hannan, our Kishoreganj correspondent reports quoting Sheikh<br />
   Mohammad Ali, the Rab commander who led the arrest drive.<br />
<br />
   A press conference will be held in this connection at Rab-1 headquarters<br />
   in the city's Uttara in the afternoon.<br />

   Taleban claim responsibility for car bomb attack on foreign base in Afghan<br />
   east<br />
   Text of report by private Pakistan-based Afghan Islamic Press news agency<br />
<br />
   Khost, 18 August: A heavy explosion has shaken Gardez city [the capital of<br />

<br />
   A suicide car bomber struck his car into the PRT [Provincial<br />
   Reconstruction Team] office in Gardez city, the capital of eastern Paktia<br />
   Province, this morning, 18 August.<br />
<br />
   The deputy governor of Paktia Province, Abdorrahman Mangal, told Afghan<br />
   Islamic Press [AIP] that the suicide attacker wanted to enter into the PRT<br />
   office with his car but police prevented him to do this and he blew his<br />
   car up outside the office. Mangal added two [Afghan] border police<br />
   soldiers had been killed and two guards injured as a result, but some<br />
   other sources told AIP that casualties were more than reported.<br />

   Eyewitnesses told AIP that following the attack the foreign forces had<br />
   transferred the bodies and injured people from the scene of the incident<br />
   in ambulances and helicopters and security forces had cordoned off the<br />
   area.<br />

   carried out the suicide attack on the large base of foreign forces in<br />
   Gardez city at around 0600 local time [0130 gmt] this morning and 27<br />
   foreign soldiers were killed and 34 others injured as a result.<br />

   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) a** A suicide bomber has detonated a small truck<br />
   laden with explosives at the entrance to a military-civilian compound in<br />
   eastern Afghanistan, killing two Afghan security guards.<br />
