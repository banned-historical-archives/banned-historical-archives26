		<h3>Tor</h3>
		<p><a href="https://www.torproject.org">Tor</a> is an encrypted anonymising network that makes it harder to intercept internet communications, or see where communications are coming from or going to.</p>
		<p>In order to use the WikiLeaks public submission system as detailed above you can download the Tor Browser Bundle, which is a Firefox-like browser available for Windows, Mac OS X and GNU/Linux and pre-configured to connect using the anonymising system Tor.</p>
		<h4>Tails</h4>
		<p>If you are at high risk and you have the capacity to do so, you can also access the submission system through a secure operating system called <a href="https://tails.boum.org">Tails</a>. Tails is an operating system launched from a USB stick or a DVD that aim to leaves no traces when the computer is shut down after use and automatically routes your internet traffic through Tor. Tails will require you to have either a USB stick or a DVD at least 4GB big and a laptop or desktop computer.</p>

		<h3>Tips</h3>
		<p>Our submission system works hard to preserve your anonymity, but we recommend you also take some of your own precautions. Please review these basic guidelines. </p>
		<div>
			<h4>1. Contact us if you have specific problems</h4>
			<p>If you have a very large submission, or a submission with a complex format, or are a high-risk source, please <a href="#submit_help_contact">contact us</a>. In our experience it is always possible to find a custom solution for even the most seemingly difficult situations.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h4>2. What computer to use</h4>
			<p>If the computer you are uploading from could subsequently be audited in an investigation, consider using a computer that is not easily tied to you. Technical users can also use <a href="https://tails.boum.org">Tails</a> to help ensure you do not leave any records of your submission on the computer.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h4>3. Do not talk about your submission to others</h4>
			<p>If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in source protection – it is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This includes other media organisations.</p>
		</div>

	</div>

		<h3>After</h3>

		<div>
			<h4>1. Do not talk about your submission to others</h4>
			<p>If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in source protection – it is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This includes other media organisations.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h4>2. Act normal</h4>
			<p>If you are a high-risk source, avoid saying anything or doing anything after submitting which might promote suspicion. In particular, you should try to stick to your normal routine and behaviour.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h4>3. Remove traces of your submission</h4>
			<p>If you are a high-risk source and the computer you prepared your submission on, or uploaded it from, could subsequently be audited in an investigation, we recommend that you format and dispose of the computer hard drive and any other storage media you used.</p>
			<p>In particular, hard drives retain data after formatting which may be visible to a digital forensics team and flash media (USB sticks, memory cards and SSD drives) retain data even after a secure erasure. If you used flash media to store sensitive data, it is important to destroy the media.</p>
			<p>If you do this and are a high-risk source you should make sure there are no traces of the clean-up, since such traces themselves may draw suspicion.</p>
			<div>
				<h4>4. If you face legal action</h4>
				<p>If a legal action is brought against you as a result of your submission, there are organisations that may help you. The Courage Foundation is an international organisation dedicated to the protection of journalistic sources. You can find more details at <a href="https://www.couragefound.org">https://www.couragefound.org</a>.</p>

		<p>WikiLeaks publishes documents of political or historical importance that are censored or otherwise suppressed. We specialise in strategic global publishing and large archives.</p>
		<p>The following is the address of our secure site where you can anonymously upload your documents to WikiLeaks editors. You can only access this submissions system through Tor. (See our <a href="#submit_help_tor">Tor tab</a> for more information.) We also advise you to read our <a href="#submit_help_tips">tips for sources</a> before submitting.</p>

			<!--<div>
				Copy this address into your Tor browser. Advanced users, if they wish, can also add a further layer of encryption to their submission using <a href="#submit_wlkey">our public PGP key</a>.
			</div>-->
		</div>

		<p>If you cannot use Tor, or your submission is very large, or you have specific requirements, WikiLeaks provides several alternative methods. <a href="#submit_help_contact">Contact us</a> to discuss how to proceed.</p>

2. LI HSIEN-NIEN (HEREAFTER ABBREVIATED AS LI): YOU
GUESTS HAVE ALL COME FROM AFAR. I WOULD LIKE TO EXPRESS

MY WELCOME TO YOU. YOU ARE ALL VERY YOUNG. LET US
LEARN FROM YOU.


3. O'NEILL: THANK YOU FOR TAKING YOUR TIME TO WELCOME
US. WE HAVE ALREADY BEEN HERE A WEEK AND WE HAVE BEEN









VERY IMPRESSED BY WHAT WE HAVE SEEN.


4. LI: YOU ARE ALL YOUNG POLITICAL LEADERS AND I
SUPPOSE ONE OF YOU WILL BECOME A FUTURE PRESIDENT.


5. LI: O'NEILL: I KNOW YOUR TIME IS VERY TIGHT. I WOULD

LIKE TO TURN THE QUESTION PART OF OUR PROGRAM OVER TO
ONE OF OUR GROUP. DOES THAT MEET WITH YOUR APPROVAL?
THE GROUP MEMBER IS BELLAMY FROM NEW YORK STATE. WE

HAVE ASKED HER TO REPRESENT THE WHOLE DELEGATION IN
POSING QUESTIONS.


6. LI: I WILL ANSWER THOSE QUESTIONS THAT I CAN.


7. O'NEILL: THANKS. CAN I ASK MISS BELLAMY TO

BEGIN?


8. LI: ALRIGHT. THOSE QUESTIONS I CAN ANSWER, I
WILL. THOSE QUESTIONS I CAN'T, I WILL EXCHANGE

OPINIONS WITH YOU.


9. BELLAMY: WE HAVE MANY QUESTIONS WE WOULD LIKE
TO ASK BUT LET ME SET FORTH THREE BASIC ONES. THE

FIRST QUESTION IS CONCERNED WITH ECONOMICS AND DEVELOP-
MENT HERE. OVER THE FOUR WEEKS THAT THE DELEGATION WILL
HAVE BEEN HERE WE WILL HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO VISIT

SOME INSTITUTIONSAND PLACES IN YOUR COUNTRY. WE
UNDERSTAND THE EMPHASIS THAT YOU HAVE BEEN PLACING

ON PROGRESS IN THE ECONOMY AND WE HAVE BEEN VERY IM-
CONFIDENTIAL

PAGE 03    PEKING 01173 01 OF 07 100629Z


PRESSED, BUT WHAT WE WOULD LIKE TO KNOW IS WHAT DO YOU

EXPECT TO BE THE KEY QUESTIONS OVER THE NEXT FIVE
YEARS AND OVER THE NEXT TEN YEARS IN ECONOMIC DECI-

SIION MAKING. SPECIFICALLY WHAT DO YOU ANTICIPATE TO
BE THE KEY QUESTIONS OVER THOSE TIME FRAMES IN INDUS-

TRY, IN AGRICULTURE, IN TRADE AND IN SCIENTIFIC AND
CULTURAL EXCHANGES WITH OTHER COUNTRIES.


10. LI: SO MANY QUESTIONS.


11. BELLAMY: THE NEXT QUESTION HAS TO DO WITH THE
MILITARY. IN LIGHT OF THE SOVIET MILITARY BUILD-UP,

WHAT IS THE THRUST OF CHINA'S MILITARY SPENDING AND
HOW MIGHT THIS IMPACT ON CHINA'S OTHER DOMESTIC

PRIORITUES. THE THIRD QUESTION CONCERNS BILATERAL
RELATIONS BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND CHINA. IN

THE SHANGHAI COMMUNIQUE OF 1972 THE US SIDE RE-
AFFIRMED ITS COMMITMENT TO PEACEFUL SOLUTION OF THE

TAIWAN QUESTION. DO RECENT STATEMENTS BY CHINESE









LEADERS THAT CHINA WILL USE FORCE TO LIBERATE TAIWAN
MAKE THE SHANGHAI COMMUNIQUE INOPERABLE AND PRECLUDE

NORMALLIZATION OF RELATIONS BETWEEN THE UNITED
STATES AND CHINA?


12. (GIVING A SNAP ANSWER): NO.


13. BELLAMY: THOSE ARE OUR THREE BASIC QUESTIONS.


14. LI: LET ME BEGIN WITH THE LAST QUESTION. I WILL
ANSWER THAT QUESTION FIRST. WITH REGARD TO SINO-US

RELATIONS, THERE ARE TWO LINES OR TWO ASPECTS SO FAR
AS TAIWAN IS CONCERNED. ONE IS THE INTERNATIONAL

QUESTION, THE INTERNATIONAL ASPECT OF RELATIONS.
BETWEEN THE US AND CHINA IT WAS STATED VERYCLEARLY

IN THE SHANGHAI COMMUNIQUE THAT THE US ACKNOWLEDGES
THAT ALL CHINESE ON EITHER SIDE OF THE TAIWAN STRAIT

CONFIDENTIAL


CONFIDENTIAL


PAGE 04    PEKING 01173 01 OF 07 100629Z


MAINTAIN THAT THERE IS ONE CHINA AND TAIWAN IS A PART
OF CHINA. THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT DOES NOT
CHALLENGE THAT POSITION. (THIS PORTION LI READ

DIRECTLY FROM THE TEXT OF THE SHANGHAI COMMUNIQUE
GIVEN HIM IN A PREPARED BRIEFING BOOK BY US DIVISION

DEPUTY DIRECTOR LIEN CHENG-PAO). AS FOR THE INTERNATIONAL
ASPECT OF THIS QUESTION THAT IS DESCRIBED IN THE

SHANGHAI COMMUNIQUE.WE ARE WILLING TO REACH A SETTLE-
MENT WITH THE US ON THIS ISSUE. THIS IS NOT ONLY

OUR PRESENT POLICY BUT ALSO THE POLICY WHICH PREMIER
CHOU SET FORTH AT THE BANDUNG CONFERENCE. AT THE BANDUNG

CONFERENCE PREMIER CHOU SET FORTH THIS POSITION TO
HIS US COUNTERPART. HE MADE PLAN THAT THIS ASPECT

OF THE TAIWAN ISSUE--THAT IS THE INTERNATIONAL ASPECT --
BETWEEN THE U.S. AND CHINA IS NEGOTIABLE. SUBSEQUENTLY

PREMIER CHOU AGAIN ADDRESSED THIS POINT AT A MEETING OF

THE HEADS OF STATE OF EIGHT COUNTRIES, THAT IS, OF
AFRO-ASIAN LEADERS ON APRIL 23, 1955. PREMIER CHOU

SAID THE FOLLOWING (LI AGAIN READ FROM A
BRIEFING PAPER): &quot;THE CHINESE PEOPLE ARE FRIENDLY

TOWARD THE UNITED STATES PEOPLE. THE CHINESE PEOPLE
DO NOT WISH TO GO TO WAR WITH THE UNITED STATES. WE

WISH TO SIT DOWN WITH THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT
AND TO DISCUSS AN EASING OF TENSIONS IN THE FAR EAST,
ESPECIALLY IN THE TAIWAN STRAIT.&quot; MAY I QUOTE STILL

ANOTHER STATEMENT MADE BY PREMIER CHOU EN-LAI. THIS
STATEMENT HE DELIVERED AT THE THIRD SESSION OF THE

FIRST NATIONAL PEOPLE'S CONGRESS ON JUNE 28, 1956.
IN THIS STATEMENT PREMIER CHOU SAID: &quot;THE CHINESE

SIDE IS NOT AGAINST AN AGREEMENT ON MUTUAL RENUNCIATION
OF USE OF FORCE IN SINO-AMERICAN RELATIONS. AT BANDUNG

THE CHINESE SIDE DECLARED THAT IT DOES NOT WANT WAR
WITH THE UNITED STATES AND IS WILLING TO SIT DOWN WITH

THE UNITED STATES ON THE QUESTION OF EASING TENSIONS IN
THE TAIWAN STRAIT. AT THE SAME TIME THERE ISA QUESTION

AS TO WHAT MEANS CHINA WILL USE TO LIBERATE TAIWAN.
THIS QUESTION WILL BE DECIDED BY THE CHINESE. THIS

CONFIDENTIAL


CONFIDENTIAL


PAGE 02    PEKING 01173 02 OF 07 100701Z


IS ENTIRELY A QUESTION OF CHINESE SOVEREIGNTY&quot;. (LI
CONTINUES) SO YOU CAN SEE TWO ASPECTS TO THE ISSUE.

ONE IS INTERNATIONAL. WE ARE WILLING TO DISCUSS WITH
YOU THIS QUESTION WITHOUT RESORT TO FORCE OR TO THREAT

OF FORCE. THE OTHER ASPECT IS DOMESTIC. TAIWAN IS A
PART OF CHINA. DURING THE CAIRO DECLARATION AND ON

THE OCCASION OF THE JAPANESE SURRENDER AT THE END OF
WORLD WAR II IT WAS CLEARLY STIPULATED THAT TAIWAN

IS PART OF CHINESE TERRITORY, THAT TAIWAN IS A PROVINCE
OF CHINA. WE SAY THAT THE TAIWAN ISSUE IS ALSO AN

INTERNAL ONEAND WHAT MEANS WE RESORT TO IN LIBERATING
TAIWAN IS ENTIRELY OUR OWN BUSINESS. WHETHER WE DECIDE

TO USE FORCE OR TO USE PEACEFUL MEANS IS ENTIRELY A
CHINESE AFFAIR. NO OTHER COUNTRY HAS A RIGHT TO
INTERVENE AND YOU WILL SEE ALSO WITH CAREFUL ATTENTION










THAT MY EXPLANATION GIVEN TODAY AND THE TWO DOCUMENTS
QUOTED ARE ENTIRELY IN ACCORD. IT SEEMS TO ME THAT

THESE TWO ASPECTS ARE A BIT CONFUSED IN THE MIINDS OF
SOME AMERICANS. THE RELATIONS BETWEEN CHINA AND THE

UNITED STATES ARE CONFUSED WITH RELATIONS BETWEEN US
AND THE JUNIOR CHIANG REGIME IN TAIWAN. ACTUALLY WE

HAVE DISCUSSED THIS QUESTION WITH MANY FRIENDS BEFORE
AND THE ISSUE HAS BEEN MUTUALLY DISCUSSED WITH YOUR

GOVERNMENT, WITH THE NIXON ADMINISTRATION, WITH THE
FORD ADMINISTRATION, AND WITH THE PRESENT ADMINISTRA-

TION. ON NUMEROUS OCCASIONS WE HAVE PUT FORWARD TO
YOUR GOVERNMENT OUR POSITION ON TAIWAN. OUR POSITION

ON TAIWAN IS THAT THE UNITED STATES MUST BREAK DIPLOMATIC
RELATIONS WITH TAIWAN, MUST WITHDRAW ALL OF ITS MILI-

TARY FORCES FROM TAIWAN, AND MUST ABROGATE ITS SO-
CALLED DEFENSE TREATY WITH TAIWAN. AS TO HOW WE SOLVE

THE ISSUE OF LIBERATING TAIWAN, THIS IS ENTIRELY AN
INTERNAL MATTER FOR CHINA TO DECIDE.


15. (LI CONTINUING) I HAVE READ A BRIEF SUMMARY OF
YOUR DISCUSSIONS WITH THE VICE FOREIGN MINISTER,

CONFIDENTIAL


CONFIDENTIAL


PAGE 03    PEKING 01173 02 OF 07 100701Z


(WANG HAI-JUNG) AND IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THE VICE
FOREIGN MINISTER IS FOR FORCE. SHE SAYS THAT (READING

A TRANSCRIPT) &quot;THERE IS A BUNCH OF COUNTER-REVOLU-
TIONARIES IN TAIWAN AND IN OUR VIEW WE THINK THE

QUESTION CAN ONLY BE RESOLVED BY A FIGHT&quot;. I FIND
THAT I AM IN AGREEMENT WITH HER -- BUT THEN SHE IS

PROBABLY A RADICAL (LAUGHTER). BEFORE THE SETTLEMENT OF THE
TAIWAN ISSUE, WE CAN HAVE SOME CONTACTS. TRADE

IS GOING ON. THERE ARE SOME CULTURAL EXCHANGES AND
THERE ARE QUITE A FEW PERSONAL EXCHANGES. AND AS

FOR THE VIEW TOWARDS THE INTERNATIONAL SITUATION,
THE VIEWS OF THE TWO SIDES ARE IN AGREEMENT ON SOME

MATTERS AND ON OTHERS THERE IS NOT SO MUCH AGREEMENT,
BUT IT DOESN'T MATTER. FOR EXAMPLE, WITH REGARD TO

THE ISSUE OF JAPAN, WE STATED THAT WE BELIEVE YOUR
RELATIONS WITH JAPAN COME FIRST. YOU MAY SAY BUT

THAT IS THE AMERICAN POINT OF VIEW. HOW CAN YOU AGREE
WITH THAT? WELL, IT IS SO ON THIS ISSUE BECAUSE BOTH

THE UNITED STATES AND JAPAN ARE CAPITALIST COUNTRIES.
YOU ALSO HAVE A MILITARY ALLIANCE BETWEEN YOU. IT IS

ALSO SAID THAT THERE IS A GREAT VOLUME OF TRADE BETWEEN
THE UNITED STATES AND JAPAN. THAT IS THE STATUS QUO.

IT IS NOT A QUESTION AS TO WHETHER ONE AGREES OR NOT,
OR WHETHER ONE OBJECTS OR NOT TO THE STATE OF AFFAIRS.

SO PERHAPS THIS IS A COMMON POINT OF VIEW. WITH
REGARD TO THE POLAR BEAR, THAT IS TO THE SOVIET
SOCIAL IMPERIALISTS, AS WE CALL THEM, WE SAY THEY










ARE INTERVENING AND ARE CONTENDING WITH YOU. BUT
WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT YOU ARE IN THE DEFENSIVE POSTURE

WHILE THEY ARE IN AN OFFENSIVE POSITION. AND AMONG
THE AMERICAN STATESMEN, IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THE VIEWS

OF DR. SCHLESINGER ARE COMPARATIVELY MORE CORRECT.
I HEAR THAT SOME OF YOU SEEM TO THINK THAT CHINA MIGHT

BE TRYING TO SOW DISCORD BETWEEN YOU AND THE SOVIET
UNION. WE ARE NOT TRYING TO SOW DISCORD. THIS IS
AN OBJE TIVE FACT. AND EVEN IF YOU BELIEVE THAT WE

LISTEN TO US? AND ALSO, ON THE ISSUE OF YOUR DETER-

MINATION TO DISARM, WE SAW THAT IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING
THE EUROPEAN SECURITY CONFERENCE THE SOVIET UNION

WENT INTO ANGOLA AND THERE WAS AN INCREASE OF THEIR
MILITARY FORCES FROM 3 TO 4 MILLION TROOPS. THAT

MAKES US DISBELIEVE IN DISARMAMENT AND DETENTE. WE

THINK THIS TALK DAY IN AND DAY OUT ABOUT DISARMAMENT
CAN ONLY HAVE THE RESULT OF LULLING THE VIGILANCE OF

THE PEOPLE SO THAT WHEN SOMETHING HAPPENS THEY WILL
BE UNPREPARED AND WE THINK THAT ON THE CONTRARY IT IS

BETTER TO KEEP ONE'S EYES OPEN AND TO MAINTAIN ONE'S









VIGILANCE HIGH RATHER THAN CLOSING ONE'S EYES AND
FALLING ASLEEP ON A SOFT PILLOW. THERE IS AN OLD

CHINESE SAYING &quot;ONE SHOULD NOT HAVE THE DESIRE TO
KILL OTHERS BUT ONE HAS THE RIGHT TO AVOID HAVING

OTHERS DO THAT TO ONESELF.&quot; IN OUR OPINION IT IS
BETTER TO MAINTAIN HIGH VIGILANCE AND YOU CAN SEE

THAT WE ARE MAKING PREPARATIONS. FOR EXAMPLE, WE
ARE DIGGING UNDERGROUND TUNNELS. BUT WE WILL NOT FIRE

THE FIRST SHOT. WE ACT ACCORDING TO THE SENTENCES
LAID DOWN BY CHAIRMAN MAO. WE WILL NOT ATTACK UNLESS

WE ARE ATTACKED. BUT IF WE ARE ATTACKED, WE WILL
CERTAINLY COUNTERATTACK. THIS IS JUST AND FAIR. WE

WILL NOT COMMIT AGGRESSION AGAINST OTHERS. BUT IF
WE ARE ATTACKED WE WILL RESPOND. THIS MUST BE FAIR.

I AM RAMPLING AWAY FROM YOUR TOPICS. (ASKS TANG
WEN-SHENG TO REMIND HIM OF THE NEXT QUESTION). SO

LET ME GO ON NOW TO DISCUSS ECONOMIC CONSTRUCTION.
CONFIDENTIAL

PAGE 02    PEKING 01173 03 OF 07 100626Z



16. YOU ARE ALL PROBABLY FAMILIAR WITH THE FACT THAT

WE ARE BUILDING OUR COUNTRY ACCORDING TO THE PRINCIPLE
OF INDEPENDENCE, KEEPING INITIATIVE IN OUR OWN HANDS

AND SELF-RELIANCE AND THE SPIRIT OF DILIGENCE, HARD
WORK AND FRUGALITY. SOME ASKED US DO YOU HAVE THE

PREREQUISITES FOR SELF-RELIANCE? AND I ANSWER YES.
CHINA HAS 800,000,000 PEOPLE AND RICH NATURAL RESOURCES.

AND I ADD THAT WE HAVE 9.6 MILLION SQUARE KILOMETERS
OF AREA. THEREFORE WE SAY WE HAVE THE PREREQUISITES

TO ENGAGE IN SELF-RELIANCE. SOME OF YOUR DELEGATION
MEMBERS, UPON HEARING THIS, THINK THAT WE ARE GOING

TO ADVOCATE A CLOSED-DOOR POLICY. BUT WE DO NOT EX-
CLUDE COMMERCIAL CONTACTS OR TECHNICAL EXCHANGES WITH

FOREIGN COUNTRIES, INCLUDING WITH ADVANCED COUNTRIES
LIKE YOURS. OUR FOREIGN TRADE IS CONDUCTED ALONG

SUCH PRINCIPLES TOO. AS FOR PRIORITIES IN DEVELOPING
OUR ECONOMY, AGRICULTURE OF COURSE COMES FIRST. THE

ORDER OF PRIORITIES IS AGRICULTURE, LIGHT INDUSTRY
AND HEAVY INDUSTRY. THIS IS BASED ON COMMON SENSE.

HUMAN BEINGS HAVE TO EAT. THEY NEED CLOTHES TO WEAR.
THEY NEED HOUSING AND TRANSPORTATION. BUT SUCH

COMMON SENSE IS SOMETIMES FORGOTTEN BY SOME PEOPLE.
FOR EXAMPLE, IN PARTY HISTORY THERE EMERGED A MAN

CALLED WANG MING, WHO FORGOT THAT PEOPLE HAD TO EAT.
HE IMAGINED THAT WE HAD A GREAT ABILITY TO STRUGGLE

AT THE TIME WHICH WOULD ALLOW US TO FIGHT ONE BATTLE
AFTER ANOTHER. TO FIGHT ONE BATTLE, THEN A SECOND,

THEN A THIRD AND THEN A FOURTH. TO STORM MAJOR CITIES
ONE AFTER ANOTHER. BUT WE DID NOT HAVE THAT ABILITY.
IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT OUR SOLDIERS COULD FIGHT ON










EMPTY STOMACHS, THAT OUR PEOPLE COULD WORK WITHOUT
SOMETHING TO EAT. THE CHAIRMAN WAS DIFFERENT. HE

SAID THAT AFTER BATTLE YOU HAVE TO REST A WHILE, ALLOW
TIME FOR MEALS REST, SOME SLEEP. SO WHY DO WE STRESS

AGRICULTURE? THERE ARE 800,000,000 MOUTHS TO FEED
CONFIDENTIAL


CONFIDENTIAL


PAGE 03    PEKING 01173 03 OF 07 100626Z


EVERY DAY. IS IT POSSIBLE TO FAST FOR ONE WEEK AFTER

ONE MEAL? NO. WE MUST EAT EVERY DAY. THAT IS WHY
WE ATTACH SUCH GREAT IMPORTANCE TO AGRICULTURE. IN

OUR COUNTRY WE DEVELOP OUR AGRICULTURE BY LEARNING
FROM TACHAI (TANG WEN-SHENG EXPLAINS THAT TACHAI IS

THE NATIONAL MODEL IN AGRICULTURE AND GIVES SOME DE-
TAILS ABOUT THE HISTORY OF TACHAI AND THE CONFERENCE

ON LEARNINGSHROM TACHAI IN AGRICULTURE WHICH WAS
HELD AT THE END OF 1976). IN THE PAST THE TACHAI
BRIGADE WAS ABLE TO PRODUCE ONE TON OF GRAIN PER

HECTARE. NOW THEYARE TURNING OUT EIGHT TO NINE TONS OF GRAIN
PER HECTARE. CAN YOU SAY THAT THERE IS A MIRACLE IN

DOING SO, OR THAT THERE IS A HIGH DEGREE OF FARM
MECHANIZATION? MO. THEY RELY ON THE WORK OF HUMAN

BEINGS, ON SOIL CONSERVATION, ON WATER CONSERVANCY.
BUT YOU PROABLY ARE NOT GOING TO TACHAI ON THIS TRIP.

YOU ARE GOING TO HUNAN AND YOU WILL SEE THAT WHEN
CHAIRMAN HUA KKUO-FENG WAS IN HUNAN YOU CAN PERHAPS SEE

THE SHAOSHAN WATER CONSERVANCY WORKS WHICH WERE DEVELOPED
UNDER THE DIRECTION OF CHAIRMAN HUA WHEN HE WAS IN

HUNAN. THERE IS NOT ONLY ONE SUCH WATER IRRIGATION
PROJECT IN CHINA. MAN Y OF OUR INDUSTRIAL MATERIALS

COME FROM AGRICULTURE. FOR EXAMPLE, COTTON, TOBACCO
AND SUGAR. MANY LIGHT INDUSTRY MATERIALS RELY ON

THESE AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS. THAT IS WHY THE CHAIRMAN
ENUNCIATED THE POLICY OF TAKING GRAIN AS THE KEY LINK

WHILE MAKING COMPREHENSIVE DEVELOPMENT. THERE IS ALSO
ANOTHER WAY OF PUTTING IT. DEVELOP COMPREHENSIVELY

AGRICLUTURE, FORESTRY, ANIMAL HUSBANDRY AND SIDELINE
PRODUCTS. AS FOR HEAVY INDUSTRY, WE WISH TO OPEN UP

NEW AREAS. ONE IS IN PETRO-CHEMICALS AND COAL. WE
HAVE SOME OIL AND THERE SEEMS TO BE GOOD PROSPECTS

FOR DEVELOPMENT. WE HAVE A TACHING OIL FIELD AND
DURING THE RECENT CONFERENCE ON LEARNING FROM TACHING

IN INDUSTRY, CHAIRMAN HUA PUT FORTH THE GOAL OF
TRYING TO ESTABLISH TEN OIL FIEILDS LIKE TACHING. WE

NATURAL GAS AND OUR HYDROELECTRIC CAPACITY. WE ALSO

WISH TO DEVELOP SOME NUCLEAR POWER PLANTS BECAUSE
WITHOUT ENERGY INDUSTRY CANNOT DEVELOP. MANY

INDUSTRIES REQUIRE STEEL BUT IN ORDER TO DEVELOP OTHER
INDUSTRIES ALL OTHER INDUSTRIES MUST BE DEVELOPED AS

WELL. BECAUSE YOU CANNOT HAVE A STEEL PLANT WITHOUT

ELECTRICITY AND YOU CANNOT HAVE THAT WITHOUT COAL.
THIS IS VERY SIMPLE REASONING. ALL WILL UNDERSTAND IT.

THEREFORE WE MUST REACH FOR A HIGH SPEED AND A PRO-
PORTIONATE DEVELOPMENT. ONE CANNOT JUST DEVELOP ONE

SIDE AND LEAVE ANOTHER ALONE. FOR EXAMPLE, IF YOU
PAY ATTENTION TO AGRICULTURE ONLY AND NEGLECT INDUSTRY,

HOW CAN YOU HAVE MACHINERY FOR FARM MECHANIZATION.
BUT TO REALIZE MECHANIZATION YOU NEED STEEL. BUT IF
ONE ONLY STRESSES INDUSTRY AND NOT AGRICULTURE PEOPLE

STILL HAVE TO EAT. OUR SYSTEM IS DIFFERENT FROM YOURS.
WE RELY ON A STATE PLAN. IT IS TROUBLESOME. THERE

IS ENTHUSIASM ON ALL FRONTS. ONE WANTS TO GO QUICKLY
AND YOU WOULD TOO. EVERYONE IS VERY COMPETITIVE.

WE HAVE A STATE PLANNING COMMISSION THAT HAS Z DEAL
WITH A FEW DOZEN MINISTRIES. THESE DO NOT ALWAYS

AGREE ON THE PRESENT PRIORITITES AND WHEN THEY HAVE
A DEBATE, IT IS VERY HEATED AND ANIMATED, PERHAPS

MORE THAN YOUR OWN CONGRESSIONAL DEBATES. AND IT
SEEMS TO ME THAT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE CENTRAL

MINISTRIES AND THE MUNICIPALITIES, FOR EXAMPLE, IS









OFTEN ONE OF COLLUSION AND CONTENTION. BUT THIS
CONFIDENTIAL


CONFIDENTIAL


PAGE 02    PEKING 01173 04 OF 07 100730Z


DOESN'T MATTER BECAUSE ALL ARE CONTRADICTIONS AMONG

THE PEOPLE AND WHEN THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE MAKES A
DECISPMN, WE SAY THAT ALL THE OTHER VIEWS DON'T COUNT,

SO WE TRY TO ADOPT A RATIONAL AND REASONABLE PROCEDURE.
WE HAVE TO PERSUADE THEM THAT THEY ARE WRONG, SO IN

THIS SENSE PLANNING IS ALSO EASY. WE HAVE TO RELY ON
PARTY COMMITTEES AND THE GOVERNMENT AT MANY LEVELS.

THE SITUATION IN OUR COUNTRY NOW IS QUITE GOOD.
PERHAPS YOU CAN VISIT SOME PLACES.


17. AS FOR MILITARY CONSTRUCTION, THE DEVELOPMENT OF

THE MILITARY INDUSTRY IS DECIDED BY THE DEVELOPMENT
OF AGRICULTURE. YOU MAY HAVE NOTICED THAT AMONG THE
FOUR MODERNIZATIONS THAT WE WISH TO ACHIEVE IS

INCLUDED MODERNIZATION OF OUR NATIONAL DEFENSE. WE
WANT TO DEVELOP OUR ARMAMENTS. THIS ALSO CALLS FOR

AN AGRICULTURAL AND AN INDUSTRIAL BASIS. IN MY
OPINION THE SOVIET UNION IS STRESSING DEVELOPMENT OF

MILITARY IN SUCH A WAY THAT ITS AGRICULTURE AND ITS
LIGHT INDUSTRY ARE DEVELOPED DISPROPORTIONATELY. THE

SOVIET PEOPLE DO NOT EAT WELL ENOUGH. THEREFORE WE
ARE TRYING FOR MODERNIZATION OF NATIONAL DEFENSE ON

THE BASIS OF DEVELOPMENT OF OTHER INDUSTRIES AND OF
AGRICULTURE. I HEAR THAT SOME FRIENDS HAVE SAID THAT

OUR WEAPONS ARE EXTREMELY BACKWARD. WE ADMIT THAT BUT
IN WARFARE WE RELY ON MILLET PLUS RIFLES. AS FOR OUR

OVERALL MILITARY CAPABILITY, IT DEPENDS ON HOW YOU
JUDGE IT AND WITH WHAT YOU COMPARE IT. IF WE COMPARE

NUCLEAR WEAPONS, FOR EXAMPLE, YOUR NUCLEAR WEAPONS CAN
BE COMPARED WITH THE THUMB WHEREAS OURS ARE SIMPLY THE

TIP OF THE SMALLEST FINGER. IF WE SAY TO THE COUNTRY
THAT YOURS ARE SO MUCH AND OURS ARE SO MUCH, THAT WOULD BE IRRELE-

VANT. WE ARE NOT WORRIED. THE HUMAN FACTOR IS FIRST. THIS IS
PROVED BY OUR HISTORY. DURING WORLD WAR II THE WEAPONS USED

BY THE JAPANESE AGGRESSIVE FORCES WERE MORE ADVANCED THAN OURS.
WE WERE HORRIBLY BACKWARD. SOME USED SPEARS AND KNIVES.

CONFIDENTIAL


CONFIDENTIAL


PAGE 03    PEKING 01173 04 OF 07 100730Z


AND CHIANG KAI-SHEK ALSO HAD WEAPONS. MANY WERE VERY
SOPHISTICATED; AIRPLANES, GUNS AND NAVAL FORCES.

THEY WERE VERY MODERN AT THAT TIME IN CHINA. WE ONLY
HAD INFANTRY, THE SIMPLEST ARTILLERY. THEY
TRAVELLED IN CARS, WE TRAVELED ON OUR FEET. IN THE










END IT SEEMS THAT THEIR CARS RAN NO FASTER THAN OUR
FEET AND THE WAR ENDED WITH THEIR DEFEAT. BUT THAT

DOES NOT MEAN THAT WE DON'T WANT TO HAVE ADVANCED
WEAPONS. WE ARE DOING OUR UTMOST TO ADVANCE TOWARD THAT

GOAL. SO MILLET AND RIFLES DURING THE PRESENT DAY ARE
NOT QUITE THE SAME. THAT IS CHINA'S BASIC MILITARY

PRINCIPLE, THAT IS, WE ARE STRIVING FOR MILITARY
MODERNIZATION BASED ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF OTHER
INDUSTRIES AND OF AGRICULTURE.


18. AS FOR EDUCATION, WE ARE TRYING OUR BEST TO ENFORCE

THE EDUCATIONAL LINE ADVANCED BY CHAIRMAN MAO. THIS
EXPERIENCED GREAT SABOTAGE BY THE GANG OF FOUR. BECAUSE

THE OLD EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM WOULD NOT ALLOW RELATIONS
BETWEEN TEACHERS AND STUDENTS THEY WERE TOO HOSTILE.

SOME OF THE TEACHERS TOOK THE STUDENTS AS ENEMIES AND
THEY WERE TOO STRICT. THEY WERE UNREASONABLE. IN SOME

EXTREME CASES, THE TEACHERS EVEN BEAT THE KIDS.
THIS CAN'T BE DONE. THIS GIVES RISE TO RESISTANCE

ON THE PART OF THE STUDENTS. THERE WAS FORCED
FEEDING OF THE STUDENTS JUST LIKE FORCED FEEDING OF OUR

PEKING DUCKS. IT DOESN'T MATTER WHETHER THEY WANT
IT OR WHETHER THEY ARE FULL - JUST SPUEEZE IT INTO

THEM. IF YOU ARE TOO GREEDY AND BITE OFF TOO MUCH
YOU CAN'T DIGEST IT. SOME TEACHERS ADOPT THE METHOD
OF SURPRISE ATTACKS AGAINST STUDENTS. THE STUDENTS

DIDN'T WANT TO PUT UP WITH THIS AND THEY BECAME VERY
ANGRY. BUT THE GANG OF FOUR TRIED TO TAKE ADVANTAGE

OF CRITICISM OF SUCH WRONG PRACTICES TO SAY THAT
STUDENTS SHOULD NOT TAKE EXAMINATIONS AT ALL. THEY

SAID STUDENTS SHOULD HAD IN BLANK PAPERS. THERE

SOCIALIST CONSCIOUSNESS AND CULTURAL KNOWLEDGE, TO

800,000,000 PEOPLE AND THAT IS WHY WE MUST GO IN FOR


FAMILY PLANNING. THIS HASBEGUN TO BE EFFECTIVE,

INCLUDING IN THE COUNTRYSIDE. IT HAS BEEN EFFECTIVE
IN THECITY FOR MANY YEARS BECAUSE THE LEVEL OF AWARE-

NESS IN URBAN AREAS IS HIGHER IN THIS RESPECT
PERHAPS BECAUSE OF HIGHER EDUCATION. AND AT PRESENT

WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OFEDUCATION AND CULTURE IN THE









COUNTRYSIDE THE RURAL POPULATION IS ACCEPTING FAMILY
PLANNING MORE AND MORE. IT SEEMS THAT THE POPULATION

OF THE UNITED STATES COULD BE INCREASED A BIT. WHAT IS
THE AREA OF YOUR COUNTRY AND WHAT IS THE POPULATION?

(ONE OF THE DELEGATION MEMBERS TELLS VICE PREMIER LI
THAT THE AREA OF THE UNITED STATES IS ABOUT THE SAME AREA AS

CHINA ANDTHAT THEPOPULATION IS AROUND 225 MILLION).
BUT WE HAVE 800,000,000 AND YOU HAVE ONLY 200 MILLION.
IN COMPARISON IT SEEMS TO ME THAT YOU HAVE TO DEVELOP

YOUR POPULATION A BIT MORE. IS THAT NOT POSSIBLE?


20. GROUP MEMBER: WE WILL TRY OUR BEST TO BE DILI-
GENT.


21. LI: SO PERHAPS THE ONLY THING WE CAN SAY IS THAT

WE WILL NOT INTERFERE IN YOUR DOMESTIC AFFAIRS. AND
WHAT WE ARE DOING IN CHINA IS ONLY EDUCATION, PROPA-

GANDA AND PERSUASION. BUT IT IS ARDUOUS EDUCATION AND
HARD PERSUASTION. AND FOR US, WE STILL WISH TO MAKE PEOPLE

AGREE WITH FAMILY PLANNING ON A VOLUNTARY BASIS. IT
WILL NOT DO TO ENGAGE IN COMMANDISM. IT SEEMS THAT THE

POLICY OF INDIRA GANDHI WAS INCORRECT, NOR WILL IT DO
TO ENFORCE OPERATIONS OR ABORTIONS. HOW CAN YOU

HAVE YOUR GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS GO OUT INTO THE STREETS AND
GRAB PEOPLE AND FORCE THEM TO HAVE OPERATIONS. PEOPLE
SIMPLY WILL NOT ACCEPT THAT. THAT WILL NOT DO. PER-

PHAS THAT IS ONE OF THE REASONS WHY MRS. GHANDI LOST
HER ELECTION. I HAVE BEEN GOING ON TOO LONG.

22. DELEGATION MEMBER: IF I COULD RETURN TO YOUR

ANSWER TO THE FIRST QUESTION, YOU MENTIONED THAT WE
ARE IN A DEFENSIVE POSTURE AND THE SOVIETS IN AN

OFFENSIVE POSTURE. I MIGHT POINT OUT THAT THAT IS IN
ACCORD WITH THE WISHES OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. THE

FOUNDATION OF OUR POLICY IS DEFENSIVE. THE BASIS OF
THIS POSTURE IS NATO, WHICH IS A DEFENSIVE ALLIANCE.
THE UNITED STATES HAS ALWAYS BEEN THIS WAY. IN THIS

THE UNITED STATES AND CHINA AGREE.


23. LI: IN THE PAST YOU HAVE LAUNCHED YOUR OFFENSI-
VES TOO.


24.DELEGATION MEMBER: WE MIGHT NOT AGREE ON WHETHER

THEY WERE OFFENSIVE OR DEFENSIVE.



25. LI: I SAY THAT THEY ARE OFFENSIVE. OF COURSE

THAT BELONGS TO THE PAST.










26. DELEGATION MEMBER: SO WE SHOULD AGREE TO LEAVE

IT IN THE PAST. ON ANGOLA I WISH TO MAKE A POINT. THE
SOVIETS AND THE CHINESE WERE BOTH ACTIVE IN ANGOLA

BEFORE THE PORTUGUESE FORCES LEFT. I MIGHT POINT OUT
THAT THIS WAS BEFORE THE EUROPEAN CONFERENCE ON SECURITY.


27. LI: WHAT I WAS TALKING ABOUT IS THE CUBAN MER-
CENARIES WENT INTO ANGOLA WITH SOVIET BACKING AFTER

THE COUNCIL ON SECURITY AND COOPERATION IN EUROPE.


28. DELEGATION MEMBER: OH, THAT'S TRUE.


29. LI: AS FOR THE PERIOD BEFORE THE CUBAN TROOPS
ENTERED ANGOLA WITH SOVIET SUPPORT, WE HAD SUPPORTED

THE THREE FACTIONS IN ANGOLA. OF COURSE, OUR SUPPORT
CONFIDENTIAL


CONFIDENTIAL


PAGE 04    PEKING 01173 05 OF 07 100750Z


WAS DIFFERENT IN NATURE. WE SUPPORTED THESE FACTIONS

AGAINST PORTUGUESE COLONIALISM WHILE THE SOVIET UNION
TRIED TO MEDDLE UNDER THE SIGNBOARD OF ANTI-COLONIALISM
WITH A PURPOSE OF INSERTING THEIR PAWNS INTO THAT AREA.

THEY SUPPORTED ONE FACTION AGAINST THE OTHERS.


30. DELEGATION MEMBER: MORE IMPORTANTLY, MR. VICE
PREMIER, WEHVRE ALL CONCERNED ABOUT TAIWAN. I AM

SURE THAT EACH TIME THE AMERICAN PEOPLE HAVE MADE
KNOWN THEIR POSITION ON TAIWAN THEY HAVE POINTED OUT

THAT THEY DESIRE A PEACEFUL SOLUTION. THE LEADERS OF
THE UNITED STATES ARE IN CLOSE TOUCH WITH THE MASSES

THROUGH OUR ELECTORAL PROCESS, THAT IS, THROUGH THE
AMERICAN ELECTIONS. IN THE SHANGHAI COMMUNIQUE THE

US SIDE REAFFIRMED ITS INTEREST IN A PEACEFUL SETTLEMENT
OF THE TAIWAN PROBLEM AND SAID IT WOULD WITHDRAW ITS

MILITARY FORCES AS TENSIONS IN THE AREA DIMINISHED.
OUR CONCERN IS THAT ON THE EVE OF OUR DEPARTURE AND

AFTER WE ARE HEARING THE CHINESE LEADERS INDICATE THAT
IT WILL BE NECESSARY TO USE FORCE TO LIBERATE TAIWAN.
THIS THREAT IS A NEW ELEMENT, AN ELEMENT NOT MENTIONED

IN THE SHANGHAI COMMUNIQUE. THAT IS, YOUR RECENT
STATEMENTS THAT YOU ARE DETERMINED TO USE FORCE OR THE

THREAT OF FORCE TO LIBERATE TAIWAN. WE ARE CONCERNED
ABOUT THE IMPACT OF SUCH STATEMENTS ON AMERICAN PUBLIC

OPINION WHICH LIMITS OUR GOVERNMENT'S FLEXIBILITY IN
REACHING A SOLUTION TO THE TAIWAN PROBLEM.


31. LI: THAT IS NOT CORRECT. WHEN WE TALK ABOUT

NOT RESORTING TO FORCE, THAT PERTAINS TO THE SINO-US
ASPECT. IN THE SHANGHAI COMMUNIQUE IT WAS STATED THAT

WE BELIEVED WE SHOULD NOT RESORT TO FORCE OR THREAT OF









FORCE IN RELATION TO OTHER STATES OR IN SETTLING
INTERNATIONAL DISPUTES, WHICH IN THIS CASE MEANS BE-

TWEEN THEPEOPLE OF THE UNITED STATES AND CHINA.

AFFIRMS THE ULTIMATE OBJECTIVE OF THE WITHDRAWAL OF

THIS OUT IS OUR CONCERN THAT RECENT STATEMENTS BY
CHINESE LEADERS CREATE TENSION RATHER THAN DIMINISH

TENSION, AND THIS CAUSES GREAT CONCERN AMONG THE
AMERICAN PEOPLE AS EXPRESSED IN PUBLIC OPINION POLLS.

AMERICAN LEADERS THEREFORE SEE IT AS MORE DIFFICULT
TO RESOLVE. OF COURSE WE ALL RECOGNIZE THAT THIS

IS YOUR INTERNAL AFFAIR. BUT IT IS ALSO AN AFFAIR









OF CONCERN TO THE UNITED STATES AND EVEN THE VICE
PREMIER'S STATEMENT THAT YOU ARE WILLING TO SIT DOWN

WITH US RECOGNIZES THAT THERE IS AN AMERICAN INTEREST.
WHETHER IT IS REASONABLE OR ILLEGITIMATE, THE US

DOES HAVE AN INTEREST. THIS NEW DEVELOPMENT MOVES
AWAY FROM A SETTLEMENT.


32. LI: THERE IS NO NEW DEVELOPMENT IN THE CHINESE

POSITION. THIS HAS BEEN OUR CONSISTENT POSITION.
BUT YOU ALWAYS STRESS THE US OPINION AND THE

EXPRESSION OF THAT OPINION IN YOUR POLICY. WHY DON'T
YOU GIVE EMPHASIS TO THE POSITION OF THE CHINESE PEOPLE?

IF THERE WAS A REFERENDUM AMONG THE 800 MILLION PEOPLE
OF CHINA, 95 PERCENT WOULD BE FOR THE IMMEDIATE

LIBERATION OF TAIWAN. YOU SAY THAT THE AMERICAN
CONFIDENTIAL

LEADERS ARE IN A DIFFICULT POSITION. WE SAY THAT IF
THE TAIWAN ISSUE IS NOT SETTLED CORRECTLY, HOW WILL WE

FACE OUR PEOPLE.


33. DELEGATION MEMBER: I THINK THAT IN SUCH A CASE
LEADERS OF BOTH COUNTRIES WILL HAVE TO USE WISDOM AND

COMPROMISE AND THUS REACH AGREEMENT. IF BOTH SIDES
FOLLOWED ONLY THE OPINIONS OF THEIR PEOPLE, THAT

IS THE 95 PERCENT OF THE CHINESE PEOPLE WHO FAVOR
LIBERATION OF TAIWAN, AND THE MAJORITY OF US PUBLIC

OPINION WHICH FAVORS A PEACEFUL SETTLEMENT, IF WE
FOLLOW ONLY THESE OPIIIONS THEN WE WOULDN'T BE

SITTING HERE TODAY. AND THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN NO
SHANGHAI COMMUNIQUE.


34. LI: I CANNOT AGREE THAT THE SHANGHAI COMMUNIQUE

AND YOUR BEING HERE TODAY ARE IN CONFLICT WITH THE
DESIRES OF OUR TWO PEOPLES. I CAN ONLY SAY THAT THE

VIEWS OF 95 PERCENT OF OUR PEOPLE ARE WELL-KNOWN TO
US AND ALL I CAN DO IN RESPONSE IS TO GIVE YOU THAT

OPINION. IN THE FINAL ANALYSIS, THE TAIWAN ISSUE IS
AN INTERNAL ISSUE AND WE ASK YOU TO CEASE YOUR

INTERFERENCE IN THIS. IF OTHERS INTERFERED IN YOUR AFFAIRS
HOW WOULD YOU REACT?


35. DELEGATION MEMBER: I MIGHT MENTION THAT THERE

WAS A DELEGATION OF MAYORS THAT INCLUDED THE MAYOR
OF SAN JUAN, PUERTO RICO, WHICH ULTIMATELY DID NOT

COME TO VISIT THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA BECAUSE
OF THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA'S POSITION THAT

PUERTO RICO IS NOT A PART OF THE UNITED STATES.

36. LI: THE CHINESE POSITION ON THAT ISSUE WAS STATED










AT THE UNITED NATIONS.


37. DELEGATION MEMBER: WITH REGARD TO NORMALIZATION

OF RELATIONS, IT IS OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO TELL YOU

STATED, THAT THIS VISIT WILL ENHANCE UNDERSTANDING

BETWEEN OUR TWO COUNTRIES. THIS KIND OF EXCHANGE IS
NECESSARY IF WE WANT TO CONTINUE THE PROCESS, A

PROCESS THAT MUST GO ON IF WE ARE TO PROCEED TO
NORMALIZATION OF RELATIONS.


38. LI: A VISIT WHICH INCLUDES EXCHANGE OF OPINIONS

CAN BE BENEFICIAL. THERE IS TIME FOR ONE FINAL QUESTION.


39. DELEGATION MEMBER: AS WE CONTINUE OUR VISIT AND
VISIT YOUR PROJECTS, I THINK IT WOULD BE HELPFUL TO

UNDERSTAND THE TOOLS OF MEASUREMENT YOU USE IN
DETERMINING YOUR CAPITAL INVESTMENT. IN OTHER WORDS,
TO UNDERSTAND WHAT METHOD YOU USE TO DECIDE

ABOUT YOUR PRIORITIES. IN THE WEST WE USE A COST
EFFECTIVENESS TECHNIQUE AND WE SIMPLY DON'T UNDERSTAND

WHAT METHOD YOU USE.

AND CAREFUL WEIGHING OF PROS AND CONS AND HEARING

OF VAST OPINIONS. BUT I MUST HONESTLY SAY THAT OUR

FIRST WE HOPE THERE ARE NO MISTAKES, BUT SECOND WE CON-

SIDER IT ALLOWABLE TO MAKE SOME MISTAKES. SO WHAT WE
RELY ON MOST OF ALL IS TO LEND AN EAR TO DIFF-

ERENT OPINIONS. LET THE PEOPLE IN THE COAL INDUSTRY,
IN THE STEEL INDUSTRY, HAVE THEIR SAY AND THEN TRY TO

BALANCE THEIR OPINIONS. OF COURSE, THIS IS TROUBLE-
SOME.


41. DELEGATION MEMBER: NO, WHAT I MEANT WAS WHAT

KIND OF METHOD DO YOU USE. FOR EXAMPLE, IN OUR COUN-
TRY WE USE RETURN ON INVESTMENT WITHIN THE GOVERNMENT

AND IN BUSINESS WE USE A COST-BENEFIT ANALYSIS. (SIC)


42. LI: THAT WORKS WITH YOUR GOVERNMENT.


43. DELEGATION MEMBER: WE UNDERSTAND THE COMPETI-
TION BETWEEN VARIOUS INTERESTS BECAUSE THAT IS THE
PROCESS IN OUR OWN GOVERNMENT, ESPECIALLY BUDGET

DEVELOPMENT.


44. LI: IN YOUR COUNTRY PROFITS TAKE COMMAND. FOR

EXAMPLE, IF TODAY THE COAL INDUSTRY TAKES IN THE MOST

PROFITS, THEN MANY OF YOUR INVESTMENTS WILL FLOW IN THAT
DIRECTION. AND WHERE THERE IS SURPLUS, FOR EXAMPLE,

WITH STEEL, INVESTMENTS WILL FLOW IN ANOTHER DIRECTION.
THAT IS NOT THE WAY WE OPERATE. IN AGRICULTURE, FOR

EXAMPLE, WE NOT ONLY DO NOT GO ABOUT IT THAT WAY, WE DO
NOT GET PROFITS BUT IN FACT WE MUST SUBSIDIZE BY MORE
THAN 5 MILLION RMB.


45. DELEGATION MEMBER: THAT IS CORRECT FOR BUSINESS

BUT NOT FOR GOVERNMENT.



46. LI: SO THAT IS THE DIFFERENCE IN OUR SOCIAL

SYSTEMS. PERHAPS IT MAKES IT MORE DIFFICULT TO
UNDERSTAND OUR SYSTEM.


47. LI: SO, ONCE AGAIN LET ME EXPRESS WELCOME TO

ALL THE FRIENDS. I HOPE THAT YOU WILL HAVE A GOOD









VISIT TO MANY PLACES AND THAT YOU WILL SEE AS MUCH
AS POSSIBLE. WHEN YOU VISIT THESE PLACES LOOK WITH

AN EYE TO COMPARING, INCLUDING FIRST OF ALL TO COM-
PARE THINGS TODAY WITH THE WAY THINGS WERE IN PRE-

LIBERATION ERA DURING THE CHIANG KAI-SHEK DAYS. OF
COURSE, WE ALSO ADMIT THAT WE HAVE MANY BACKWARD

ASPECTS. FOR EXAMPLE, IN THE MEANS OF TRANSPORT WE
HAVE BOTH ADVANCED AND VERY BACKWARD MEANS. ON THE
ONE HAND WE HAVE AIRPLANES, SHIPS, TRAINS AND AUTO-

MOBILES. BUT WE ALSO HAVE OXEN CARTS. WE ALSO RELY
ON HUMAN LABOR, SUCH AS PEOPLE PUSHING CARTS OR CARRY-

ING THINGS ON THEIR BACKS. BUT I THINK IT IS GOOD
TO HAVE CANDID EXCHANGES.


48. DELEGATION MEMBER: I THINK WE HAVE ALREADY EX-

CEEDED OUR ALLOTED TIME. WE THANK YOU FOR THIS GOOD
OPPORTUNITY TO HEAR YOU AND TO COME TO THE GREAT HALL OF

PEOPLE. WE OLD PEOPLE ARE MOVING TOWARD DEATH.

ELDERS. TODAY WE HAVE LEARNED MUCH FROM YOU.

2. LI HSIEN-NIEN (HEREAFTER ABBREVIATED AS LI): YOU
GUESTS HAVE ALL COME FROM AFAR. I WOULD LIKE TO EXPRESS

MY WELCOME TO YOU. YOU ARE ALL VERY YOUNG. LET US
LEARN FROM YOU.


3. O'NEILL: THANK YOU FOR TAKING YOUR TIME TO WELCOME
US. WE HAVE ALREADY BEEN HERE A WEEK AND WE HAVE BEEN









VERY IMPRESSED BY WHAT WE HAVE SEEN.


4. LI: YOU ARE ALL YOUNG POLITICAL LEADERS AND I
SUPPOSE ONE OF YOU WILL BECOME A FUTURE PRESIDENT.


5. LI: O'NEILL: I KNOW YOUR TIME IS VERY TIGHT. I WOULD

LIKE TO TURN THE QUESTION PART OF OUR PROGRAM OVER TO
ONE OF OUR GROUP. DOES THAT MEET WITH YOUR APPROVAL?
THE GROUP MEMBER IS BELLAMY FROM NEW YORK STATE. WE

HAVE ASKED HER TO REPRESENT THE WHOLE DELEGATION IN
POSING QUESTIONS.


6. LI: I WILL ANSWER THOSE QUESTIONS THAT I CAN.


7. O'NEILL: THANKS. CAN I ASK MISS BELLAMY TO

BEGIN?


8. LI: ALRIGHT. THOSE QUESTIONS I CAN ANSWER, I
WILL. THOSE QUESTIONS I CAN'T, I WILL EXCHANGE

OPINIONS WITH YOU.


9. BELLAMY: WE HAVE MANY QUESTIONS WE WOULD LIKE
TO ASK BUT LET ME SET FORTH THREE BASIC ONES. THE

FIRST QUESTION IS CONCERNED WITH ECONOMICS AND DEVELOP-
MENT HERE. OVER THE FOUR WEEKS THAT THE DELEGATION WILL
HAVE BEEN HERE WE WILL HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO VISIT

SOME INSTITUTIONSAND PLACES IN YOUR COUNTRY. WE
UNDERSTAND THE EMPHASIS THAT YOU HAVE BEEN PLACING

ON PROGRESS IN THE ECONOMY AND WE HAVE BEEN VERY IM-
CONFIDENTIAL


CONFIDENTIAL


PAGE 03    PEKING 01173 01 OF 07 100629Z


PRESSED, BUT WHAT WE WOULD LIKE TO KNOW IS WHAT DO YOU

EXPECT TO BE THE KEY QUESTIONS OVER THE NEXT FIVE
YEARS AND OVER THE NEXT TEN YEARS IN ECONOMIC DECI-

SIION MAKING. SPECIFICALLY WHAT DO YOU ANTICIPATE TO
BE THE KEY QUESTIONS OVER THOSE TIME FRAMES IN INDUS-

TRY, IN AGRICULTURE, IN TRADE AND IN SCIENTIFIC AND
CULTURAL EXCHANGES WITH OTHER COUNTRIES.


10. LI: SO MANY QUESTIONS.


11. BELLAMY: THE NEXT QUESTION HAS TO DO WITH THE
MILITARY. IN LIGHT OF THE SOVIET MILITARY BUILD-UP,

WHAT IS THE THRUST OF CHINA'S MILITARY SPENDING AND
HOW MIGHT THIS IMPACT ON CHINA'S OTHER DOMESTIC

PRIORITUES. THE THIRD QUESTION CONCERNS BILATERAL
RELATIONS BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND CHINA. IN

THE SHANGHAI COMMUNIQUE OF 1972 THE US SIDE RE-
AFFIRMED ITS COMMITMENT TO PEACEFUL SOLUTION OF THE

TAIWAN QUESTION. DO RECENT STATEMENTS BY CHINESE









LEADERS THAT CHINA WILL USE FORCE TO LIBERATE TAIWAN
MAKE THE SHANGHAI COMMUNIQUE INOPERABLE AND PRECLUDE

NORMALLIZATION OF RELATIONS BETWEEN THE UNITED
STATES AND CHINA?


12. (GIVING A SNAP ANSWER): NO.


13. BELLAMY: THOSE ARE OUR THREE BASIC QUESTIONS.


14. LI: LET ME BEGIN WITH THE LAST QUESTION. I WILL
ANSWER THAT QUESTION FIRST. WITH REGARD TO SINO-US

RELATIONS, THERE ARE TWO LINES OR TWO ASPECTS SO FAR
AS TAIWAN IS CONCERNED. ONE IS THE INTERNATIONAL

QUESTION, THE INTERNATIONAL ASPECT OF RELATIONS.
BETWEEN THE US AND CHINA IT WAS STATED VERYCLEARLY

IN THE SHANGHAI COMMUNIQUE THAT THE US ACKNOWLEDGES
THAT ALL CHINESE ON EITHER SIDE OF THE TAIWAN STRAIT

CONFIDENTIAL


PAGE 04    PEKING 01173 01 OF 07 100629Z


MAINTAIN THAT THERE IS ONE CHINA AND TAIWAN IS A PART
OF CHINA. THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT DOES NOT
CHALLENGE THAT POSITION. (THIS PORTION LI READ

DIRECTLY FROM THE TEXT OF THE SHANGHAI COMMUNIQUE
GIVEN HIM IN A PREPARED BRIEFING BOOK BY US DIVISION

DEPUTY DIRECTOR LIEN CHENG-PAO). AS FOR THE INTERNATIONAL
ASPECT OF THIS QUESTION THAT IS DESCRIBED IN THE

SHANGHAI COMMUNIQUE.WE ARE WILLING TO REACH A SETTLE-
MENT WITH THE US ON THIS ISSUE. THIS IS NOT ONLY

OUR PRESENT POLICY BUT ALSO THE POLICY WHICH PREMIER
CHOU SET FORTH AT THE BANDUNG CONFERENCE. AT THE BANDUNG

CONFERENCE PREMIER CHOU SET FORTH THIS POSITION TO
HIS US COUNTERPART. HE MADE PLAN THAT THIS ASPECT

OF THE TAIWAN ISSUE--THAT IS THE INTERNATIONAL ASPECT --
BETWEEN THE U.S. AND CHINA IS NEGOTIABLE. SUBSEQUENTLY

PREMIER CHOU AGAIN ADDRESSED THIS POINT AT A MEETING OF

THE HEADS OF STATE OF EIGHT COUNTRIES, THAT IS, OF
AFRO-ASIAN LEADERS ON APRIL 23, 1955. PREMIER CHOU

SAID THE FOLLOWING (LI AGAIN READ FROM A
BRIEFING PAPER): &quot;THE CHINESE PEOPLE ARE FRIENDLY

TOWARD THE UNITED STATES PEOPLE. THE CHINESE PEOPLE
DO NOT WISH TO GO TO WAR WITH THE UNITED STATES. WE

WISH TO SIT DOWN WITH THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT
AND TO DISCUSS AN EASING OF TENSIONS IN THE FAR EAST,
ESPECIALLY IN THE TAIWAN STRAIT.&quot; MAY I QUOTE STILL

ANOTHER STATEMENT MADE BY PREMIER CHOU EN-LAI. THIS
STATEMENT HE DELIVERED AT THE THIRD SESSION OF THE

FIRST NATIONAL PEOPLE'S CONGRESS ON JUNE 28, 1956.
IN THIS STATEMENT PREMIER CHOU SAID: &quot;THE CHINESE

SIDE IS NOT AGAINST AN AGREEMENT ON MUTUAL RENUNCIATION
OF USE OF FORCE IN SINO-AMERICAN RELATIONS. AT BANDUNG

THE CHINESE SIDE DECLARED THAT IT DOES NOT WANT WAR
WITH THE UNITED STATES AND IS WILLING TO SIT DOWN WITH

THE UNITED STATES ON THE QUESTION OF EASING TENSIONS IN
THE TAIWAN STRAIT. AT THE SAME TIME THERE ISA QUESTION

AS TO WHAT MEANS CHINA WILL USE TO LIBERATE TAIWAN.
THIS QUESTION WILL BE DECIDED BY THE CHINESE. THIS

CONFIDENTIAL


CONFIDENTIAL


PAGE 02    PEKING 01173 02 OF 07 100701Z


IS ENTIRELY A QUESTION OF CHINESE SOVEREIGNTY&quot;. (LI
CONTINUES) SO YOU CAN SEE TWO ASPECTS TO THE ISSUE.

ONE IS INTERNATIONAL. WE ARE WILLING TO DISCUSS WITH
YOU THIS QUESTION WITHOUT RESORT TO FORCE OR TO THREAT

OF FORCE. THE OTHER ASPECT IS DOMESTIC. TAIWAN IS A
PART OF CHINA. DURING THE CAIRO DECLARATION AND ON

THE OCCASION OF THE JAPANESE SURRENDER AT THE END OF
WORLD WAR II IT WAS CLEARLY STIPULATED THAT TAIWAN

IS PART OF CHINESE TERRITORY, THAT TAIWAN IS A PROVINCE
OF CHINA. WE SAY THAT THE TAIWAN ISSUE IS ALSO AN

INTERNAL ONEAND WHAT MEANS WE RESORT TO IN LIBERATING
TAIWAN IS ENTIRELY OUR OWN BUSINESS. WHETHER WE DECIDE

TO USE FORCE OR TO USE PEACEFUL MEANS IS ENTIRELY A
CHINESE AFFAIR. NO OTHER COUNTRY HAS A RIGHT TO
INTERVENE AND YOU WILL SEE ALSO WITH CAREFUL ATTENTION










THAT MY EXPLANATION GIVEN TODAY AND THE TWO DOCUMENTS
QUOTED ARE ENTIRELY IN ACCORD. IT SEEMS TO ME THAT

THESE TWO ASPECTS ARE A BIT CONFUSED IN THE MIINDS OF
SOME AMERICANS. THE RELATIONS BETWEEN CHINA AND THE

UNITED STATES ARE CONFUSED WITH RELATIONS BETWEEN US
AND THE JUNIOR CHIANG REGIME IN TAIWAN. ACTUALLY WE

HAVE DISCUSSED THIS QUESTION WITH MANY FRIENDS BEFORE
AND THE ISSUE HAS BEEN MUTUALLY DISCUSSED WITH YOUR

GOVERNMENT, WITH THE NIXON ADMINISTRATION, WITH THE
FORD ADMINISTRATION, AND WITH THE PRESENT ADMINISTRA-

TION. ON NUMEROUS OCCASIONS WE HAVE PUT FORWARD TO
YOUR GOVERNMENT OUR POSITION ON TAIWAN. OUR POSITION

ON TAIWAN IS THAT THE UNITED STATES MUST BREAK DIPLOMATIC
RELATIONS WITH TAIWAN, MUST WITHDRAW ALL OF ITS MILI-

TARY FORCES FROM TAIWAN, AND MUST ABROGATE ITS SO-
CALLED DEFENSE TREATY WITH TAIWAN. AS TO HOW WE SOLVE

THE ISSUE OF LIBERATING TAIWAN, THIS IS ENTIRELY AN
INTERNAL MATTER FOR CHINA TO DECIDE.


15. (LI CONTINUING) I HAVE READ A BRIEF SUMMARY OF
YOUR DISCUSSIONS WITH THE VICE FOREIGN MINISTER,

CONFIDENTIAL


CONFIDENTIAL


PAGE 03    PEKING 01173 02 OF 07 100701Z


(WANG HAI-JUNG) AND IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THE VICE
FOREIGN MINISTER IS FOR FORCE. SHE SAYS THAT (READING

A TRANSCRIPT) &quot;THERE IS A BUNCH OF COUNTER-REVOLU-
TIONARIES IN TAIWAN AND IN OUR VIEW WE THINK THE

QUESTION CAN ONLY BE RESOLVED BY A FIGHT&quot;. I FIND
THAT I AM IN AGREEMENT WITH HER -- BUT THEN SHE IS

PROBABLY A RADICAL (LAUGHTER). BEFORE THE SETTLEMENT OF THE
TAIWAN ISSUE, WE CAN HAVE SOME CONTACTS. TRADE

IS GOING ON. THERE ARE SOME CULTURAL EXCHANGES AND
THERE ARE QUITE A FEW PERSONAL EXCHANGES. AND AS

FOR THE VIEW TOWARDS THE INTERNATIONAL SITUATION,
THE VIEWS OF THE TWO SIDES ARE IN AGREEMENT ON SOME

MATTERS AND ON OTHERS THERE IS NOT SO MUCH AGREEMENT,
BUT IT DOESN'T MATTER. FOR EXAMPLE, WITH REGARD TO

THE ISSUE OF JAPAN, WE STATED THAT WE BELIEVE YOUR
RELATIONS WITH JAPAN COME FIRST. YOU MAY SAY BUT

THAT IS THE AMERICAN POINT OF VIEW. HOW CAN YOU AGREE
WITH THAT? WELL, IT IS SO ON THIS ISSUE BECAUSE BOTH

THE UNITED STATES AND JAPAN ARE CAPITALIST COUNTRIES.
YOU ALSO HAVE A MILITARY ALLIANCE BETWEEN YOU. IT IS

ALSO SAID THAT THERE IS A GREAT VOLUME OF TRADE BETWEEN
THE UNITED STATES AND JAPAN. THAT IS THE STATUS QUO.

IT IS NOT A QUESTION AS TO WHETHER ONE AGREES OR NOT,
OR WHETHER ONE OBJECTS OR NOT TO THE STATE OF AFFAIRS.

SO PERHAPS THIS IS A COMMON POINT OF VIEW. WITH
REGARD TO THE POLAR BEAR, THAT IS TO THE SOVIET
SOCIAL IMPERIALISTS, AS WE CALL THEM, WE SAY THEY










ARE INTERVENING AND ARE CONTENDING WITH YOU. BUT
WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT YOU ARE IN THE DEFENSIVE POSTURE

WHILE THEY ARE IN AN OFFENSIVE POSITION. AND AMONG
THE AMERICAN STATESMEN, IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THE VIEWS

OF DR. SCHLESINGER ARE COMPARATIVELY MORE CORRECT.
I HEAR THAT SOME OF YOU SEEM TO THINK THAT CHINA MIGHT

BE TRYING TO SOW DISCORD BETWEEN YOU AND THE SOVIET
UNION. WE ARE NOT TRYING TO SOW DISCORD. THIS IS
AN OBJE TIVE FACT. AND EVEN IF YOU BELIEVE THAT WE

CONFIDENTIAL


CONFIDENTIAL


PAGE 04    PEKING 01173 02 OF 07 100701Z


ARE TRYING TO SOW DISCORD, WHY WOULD YOU HAVE TO
LISTEN TO US? AND ALSO, ON THE ISSUE OF YOUR DETER-

MINATION TO DISARM, WE SAW THAT IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING
THE EUROPEAN SECURITY CONFERENCE THE SOVIET UNION

WENT INTO ANGOLA AND THERE WAS AN INCREASE OF THEIR
MILITARY FORCES FROM 3 TO 4 MILLION TROOPS. THAT

MAKES US DISBELIEVE IN DISARMAMENT AND DETENTE. WE

THINK THIS TALK DAY IN AND DAY OUT ABOUT DISARMAMENT
CAN ONLY HAVE THE RESULT OF LULLING THE VIGILANCE OF

THE PEOPLE SO THAT WHEN SOMETHING HAPPENS THEY WILL
BE UNPREPARED AND WE THINK THAT ON THE CONTRARY IT IS

BETTER TO KEEP ONE'S EYES OPEN AND TO MAINTAIN ONE'S









VIGILANCE HIGH RATHER THAN CLOSING ONE'S EYES AND
FALLING ASLEEP ON A SOFT PILLOW. THERE IS AN OLD

CHINESE SAYING &quot;ONE SHOULD NOT HAVE THE DESIRE TO
KILL OTHERS BUT ONE HAS THE RIGHT TO AVOID HAVING

OTHERS DO THAT TO ONESELF.&quot; IN OUR OPINION IT IS
BETTER TO MAINTAIN HIGH VIGILANCE AND YOU CAN SEE

THAT WE ARE MAKING PREPARATIONS. FOR EXAMPLE, WE
ARE DIGGING UNDERGROUND TUNNELS. BUT WE WILL NOT FIRE

THE FIRST SHOT. WE ACT ACCORDING TO THE SENTENCES
LAID DOWN BY CHAIRMAN MAO. WE WILL NOT ATTACK UNLESS

WE ARE ATTACKED. BUT IF WE ARE ATTACKED, WE WILL
CERTAINLY COUNTERATTACK. THIS IS JUST AND FAIR. WE

WILL NOT COMMIT AGGRESSION AGAINST OTHERS. BUT IF
WE ARE ATTACKED WE WILL RESPOND. THIS MUST BE FAIR.

I AM RAMPLING AWAY FROM YOUR TOPICS. (ASKS TANG
WEN-SHENG TO REMIND HIM OF THE NEXT QUESTION). SO

LET ME GO ON NOW TO DISCUSS ECONOMIC CONSTRUCTION.

16. YOU ARE ALL PROBABLY FAMILIAR WITH THE FACT THAT

WE ARE BUILDING OUR COUNTRY ACCORDING TO THE PRINCIPLE
OF INDEPENDENCE, KEEPING INITIATIVE IN OUR OWN HANDS

AND SELF-RELIANCE AND THE SPIRIT OF DILIGENCE, HARD
WORK AND FRUGALITY. SOME ASKED US DO YOU HAVE THE

PREREQUISITES FOR SELF-RELIANCE? AND I ANSWER YES.
CHINA HAS 800,000,000 PEOPLE AND RICH NATURAL RESOURCES.

AND I ADD THAT WE HAVE 9.6 MILLION SQUARE KILOMETERS
OF AREA. THEREFORE WE SAY WE HAVE THE PREREQUISITES

TO ENGAGE IN SELF-RELIANCE. SOME OF YOUR DELEGATION
MEMBERS, UPON HEARING THIS, THINK THAT WE ARE GOING

TO ADVOCATE A CLOSED-DOOR POLICY. BUT WE DO NOT EX-
CLUDE COMMERCIAL CONTACTS OR TECHNICAL EXCHANGES WITH

FOREIGN COUNTRIES, INCLUDING WITH ADVANCED COUNTRIES
LIKE YOURS. OUR FOREIGN TRADE IS CONDUCTED ALONG

SUCH PRINCIPLES TOO. AS FOR PRIORITIES IN DEVELOPING
OUR ECONOMY, AGRICULTURE OF COURSE COMES FIRST. THE

ORDER OF PRIORITIES IS AGRICULTURE, LIGHT INDUSTRY
AND HEAVY INDUSTRY. THIS IS BASED ON COMMON SENSE.

HUMAN BEINGS HAVE TO EAT. THEY NEED CLOTHES TO WEAR.
THEY NEED HOUSING AND TRANSPORTATION. BUT SUCH

COMMON SENSE IS SOMETIMES FORGOTTEN BY SOME PEOPLE.
FOR EXAMPLE, IN PARTY HISTORY THERE EMERGED A MAN

CALLED WANG MING, WHO FORGOT THAT PEOPLE HAD TO EAT.
HE IMAGINED THAT WE HAD A GREAT ABILITY TO STRUGGLE

AT THE TIME WHICH WOULD ALLOW US TO FIGHT ONE BATTLE
AFTER ANOTHER. TO FIGHT ONE BATTLE, THEN A SECOND,

THEN A THIRD AND THEN A FOURTH. TO STORM MAJOR CITIES
ONE AFTER ANOTHER. BUT WE DID NOT HAVE THAT ABILITY.
IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT OUR SOLDIERS COULD FIGHT ON










EMPTY STOMACHS, THAT OUR PEOPLE COULD WORK WITHOUT
SOMETHING TO EAT. THE CHAIRMAN WAS DIFFERENT. HE

SAID THAT AFTER BATTLE YOU HAVE TO REST A WHILE, ALLOW
TIME FOR MEALS REST, SOME SLEEP. SO WHY DO WE STRESS

AGRICULTURE? THERE ARE 800,000,000 MOUTHS TO FEED
CONFIDENTIAL


CONFIDENTIAL


PAGE 03    PEKING 01173 03 OF 07 100626Z


EVERY DAY. IS IT POSSIBLE TO FAST FOR ONE WEEK AFTER

ONE MEAL? NO. WE MUST EAT EVERY DAY. THAT IS WHY
WE ATTACH SUCH GREAT IMPORTANCE TO AGRICULTURE. IN

OUR COUNTRY WE DEVELOP OUR AGRICULTURE BY LEARNING
FROM TACHAI (TANG WEN-SHENG EXPLAINS THAT TACHAI IS

THE NATIONAL MODEL IN AGRICULTURE AND GIVES SOME DE-
TAILS ABOUT THE HISTORY OF TACHAI AND THE CONFERENCE

ON LEARNINGSHROM TACHAI IN AGRICULTURE WHICH WAS
HELD AT THE END OF 1976). IN THE PAST THE TACHAI
BRIGADE WAS ABLE TO PRODUCE ONE TON OF GRAIN PER

HECTARE. NOW THEYARE TURNING OUT EIGHT TO NINE TONS OF GRAIN
PER HECTARE. CAN YOU SAY THAT THERE IS A MIRACLE IN

DOING SO, OR THAT THERE IS A HIGH DEGREE OF FARM
MECHANIZATION? MO. THEY RELY ON THE WORK OF HUMAN

BEINGS, ON SOIL CONSERVATION, ON WATER CONSERVANCY.
BUT YOU PROABLY ARE NOT GOING TO TACHAI ON THIS TRIP.

YOU ARE GOING TO HUNAN AND YOU WILL SEE THAT WHEN
CHAIRMAN HUA KKUO-FENG WAS IN HUNAN YOU CAN PERHAPS SEE

THE SHAOSHAN WATER CONSERVANCY WORKS WHICH WERE DEVELOPED
UNDER THE DIRECTION OF CHAIRMAN HUA WHEN HE WAS IN

HUNAN. THERE IS NOT ONLY ONE SUCH WATER IRRIGATION
PROJECT IN CHINA. MAN Y OF OUR INDUSTRIAL MATERIALS

COME FROM AGRICULTURE. FOR EXAMPLE, COTTON, TOBACCO
AND SUGAR. MANY LIGHT INDUSTRY MATERIALS RELY ON

THESE AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS. THAT IS WHY THE CHAIRMAN
ENUNCIATED THE POLICY OF TAKING GRAIN AS THE KEY LINK

WHILE MAKING COMPREHENSIVE DEVELOPMENT. THERE IS ALSO
ANOTHER WAY OF PUTTING IT. DEVELOP COMPREHENSIVELY

AGRICLUTURE, FORESTRY, ANIMAL HUSBANDRY AND SIDELINE
PRODUCTS. AS FOR HEAVY INDUSTRY, WE WISH TO OPEN UP

NEW AREAS. ONE IS IN PETRO-CHEMICALS AND COAL. WE
HAVE SOME OIL AND THERE SEEMS TO BE GOOD PROSPECTS

FOR DEVELOPMENT. WE HAVE A TACHING OIL FIELD AND
DURING THE RECENT CONFERENCE ON LEARNING FROM TACHING

IN INDUSTRY, CHAIRMAN HUA PUT FORTH THE GOAL OF
TRYING TO ESTABLISH TEN OIL FIEILDS LIKE TACHING. WE

NATURAL GAS AND OUR HYDROELECTRIC CAPACITY. WE ALSO

WISH TO DEVELOP SOME NUCLEAR POWER PLANTS BECAUSE
WITHOUT ENERGY INDUSTRY CANNOT DEVELOP. MANY

INDUSTRIES REQUIRE STEEL BUT IN ORDER TO DEVELOP OTHER
INDUSTRIES ALL OTHER INDUSTRIES MUST BE DEVELOPED AS

WELL. BECAUSE YOU CANNOT HAVE A STEEL PLANT WITHOUT

ELECTRICITY AND YOU CANNOT HAVE THAT WITHOUT COAL.
THIS IS VERY SIMPLE REASONING. ALL WILL UNDERSTAND IT.

THEREFORE WE MUST REACH FOR A HIGH SPEED AND A PRO-
PORTIONATE DEVELOPMENT. ONE CANNOT JUST DEVELOP ONE

SIDE AND LEAVE ANOTHER ALONE. FOR EXAMPLE, IF YOU
PAY ATTENTION TO AGRICULTURE ONLY AND NEGLECT INDUSTRY,

HOW CAN YOU HAVE MACHINERY FOR FARM MECHANIZATION.
BUT TO REALIZE MECHANIZATION YOU NEED STEEL. BUT IF
ONE ONLY STRESSES INDUSTRY AND NOT AGRICULTURE PEOPLE

STILL HAVE TO EAT. OUR SYSTEM IS DIFFERENT FROM YOURS.
WE RELY ON A STATE PLAN. IT IS TROUBLESOME. THERE

IS ENTHUSIASM ON ALL FRONTS. ONE WANTS TO GO QUICKLY
AND YOU WOULD TOO. EVERYONE IS VERY COMPETITIVE.

WE HAVE A STATE PLANNING COMMISSION THAT HAS Z DEAL
WITH A FEW DOZEN MINISTRIES. THESE DO NOT ALWAYS

AGREE ON THE PRESENT PRIORITITES AND WHEN THEY HAVE
A DEBATE, IT IS VERY HEATED AND ANIMATED, PERHAPS

MORE THAN YOUR OWN CONGRESSIONAL DEBATES. AND IT
SEEMS TO ME THAT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE CENTRAL

MINISTRIES AND THE MUNICIPALITIES, FOR EXAMPLE, IS









OFTEN ONE OF COLLUSION AND CONTENTION. BUT THIS
CONFIDENTIAL


CONFIDENTIAL


PAGE 02    PEKING 01173 04 OF 07 100730Z


DOESN'T MATTER BECAUSE ALL ARE CONTRADICTIONS AMONG

THE PEOPLE AND WHEN THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE MAKES A
DECISPMN, WE SAY THAT ALL THE OTHER VIEWS DON'T COUNT,

SO WE TRY TO ADOPT A RATIONAL AND REASONABLE PROCEDURE.
WE HAVE TO PERSUADE THEM THAT THEY ARE WRONG, SO IN

THIS SENSE PLANNING IS ALSO EASY. WE HAVE TO RELY ON
PARTY COMMITTEES AND THE GOVERNMENT AT MANY LEVELS.

THE SITUATION IN OUR COUNTRY NOW IS QUITE GOOD.
PERHAPS YOU CAN VISIT SOME PLACES.


17. AS FOR MILITARY CONSTRUCTION, THE DEVELOPMENT OF

THE MILITARY INDUSTRY IS DECIDED BY THE DEVELOPMENT
OF AGRICULTURE. YOU MAY HAVE NOTICED THAT AMONG THE
FOUR MODERNIZATIONS THAT WE WISH TO ACHIEVE IS

INCLUDED MODERNIZATION OF OUR NATIONAL DEFENSE. WE
WANT TO DEVELOP OUR ARMAMENTS. THIS ALSO CALLS FOR

AN AGRICULTURAL AND AN INDUSTRIAL BASIS. IN MY
OPINION THE SOVIET UNION IS STRESSING DEVELOPMENT OF

MILITARY IN SUCH A WAY THAT ITS AGRICULTURE AND ITS
LIGHT INDUSTRY ARE DEVELOPED DISPROPORTIONATELY. THE

SOVIET PEOPLE DO NOT EAT WELL ENOUGH. THEREFORE WE
ARE TRYING FOR MODERNIZATION OF NATIONAL DEFENSE ON

THE BASIS OF DEVELOPMENT OF OTHER INDUSTRIES AND OF
AGRICULTURE. I HEAR THAT SOME FRIENDS HAVE SAID THAT

OUR WEAPONS ARE EXTREMELY BACKWARD. WE ADMIT THAT BUT
IN WARFARE WE RELY ON MILLET PLUS RIFLES. AS FOR OUR

OVERALL MILITARY CAPABILITY, IT DEPENDS ON HOW YOU
JUDGE IT AND WITH WHAT YOU COMPARE IT. IF WE COMPARE

NUCLEAR WEAPONS, FOR EXAMPLE, YOUR NUCLEAR WEAPONS CAN
BE COMPARED WITH THE THUMB WHEREAS OURS ARE SIMPLY THE

TIP OF THE SMALLEST FINGER. IF WE SAY TO THE COUNTRY
THAT YOURS ARE SO MUCH AND OURS ARE SO MUCH, THAT WOULD BE IRRELE-

VANT. WE ARE NOT WORRIED. THE HUMAN FACTOR IS FIRST. THIS IS
PROVED BY OUR HISTORY. DURING WORLD WAR II THE WEAPONS USED

BY THE JAPANESE AGGRESSIVE FORCES WERE MORE ADVANCED THAN OURS.
WE WERE HORRIBLY BACKWARD. SOME USED SPEARS AND KNIVES.

CONFIDENTIAL


CONFIDENTIAL


PAGE 03    PEKING 01173 04 OF 07 100730Z


AND CHIANG KAI-SHEK ALSO HAD WEAPONS. MANY WERE VERY
SOPHISTICATED; AIRPLANES, GUNS AND NAVAL FORCES.

THEY WERE VERY MODERN AT THAT TIME IN CHINA. WE ONLY
HAD INFANTRY, THE SIMPLEST ARTILLERY. THEY
TRAVELLED IN CARS, WE TRAVELED ON OUR FEET. IN THE










END IT SEEMS THAT THEIR CARS RAN NO FASTER THAN OUR
FEET AND THE WAR ENDED WITH THEIR DEFEAT. BUT THAT

DOES NOT MEAN THAT WE DON'T WANT TO HAVE ADVANCED
WEAPONS. WE ARE DOING OUR UTMOST TO ADVANCE TOWARD THAT

GOAL. SO MILLET AND RIFLES DURING THE PRESENT DAY ARE
NOT QUITE THE SAME. THAT IS CHINA'S BASIC MILITARY

PRINCIPLE, THAT IS, WE ARE STRIVING FOR MILITARY
MODERNIZATION BASED ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF OTHER
INDUSTRIES AND OF AGRICULTURE.


18. AS FOR EDUCATION, WE ARE TRYING OUR BEST TO ENFORCE

THE EDUCATIONAL LINE ADVANCED BY CHAIRMAN MAO. THIS
EXPERIENCED GREAT SABOTAGE BY THE GANG OF FOUR. BECAUSE

THE OLD EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM WOULD NOT ALLOW RELATIONS
BETWEEN TEACHERS AND STUDENTS THEY WERE TOO HOSTILE.

SOME OF THE TEACHERS TOOK THE STUDENTS AS ENEMIES AND
THEY WERE TOO STRICT. THEY WERE UNREASONABLE. IN SOME

EXTREME CASES, THE TEACHERS EVEN BEAT THE KIDS.
THIS CAN'T BE DONE. THIS GIVES RISE TO RESISTANCE

ON THE PART OF THE STUDENTS. THERE WAS FORCED
FEEDING OF THE STUDENTS JUST LIKE FORCED FEEDING OF OUR

PEKING DUCKS. IT DOESN'T MATTER WHETHER THEY WANT
IT OR WHETHER THEY ARE FULL - JUST SPUEEZE IT INTO

THEM. IF YOU ARE TOO GREEDY AND BITE OFF TOO MUCH
YOU CAN'T DIGEST IT. SOME TEACHERS ADOPT THE METHOD
OF SURPRISE ATTACKS AGAINST STUDENTS. THE STUDENTS

DIDN'T WANT TO PUT UP WITH THIS AND THEY BECAME VERY
ANGRY. BUT THE GANG OF FOUR TRIED TO TAKE ADVANTAGE

OF CRITICISM OF SUCH WRONG PRACTICES TO SAY THAT
STUDENTS SHOULD NOT TAKE EXAMINATIONS AT ALL. THEY

SAID STUDENTS SHOULD HAD IN BLANK PAPERS. THERE

SOCIALIST CONSCIOUSNESS AND CULTURAL KNOWLEDGE, TO

INTELLECTUALS ARE GOOD PEOPLE, SO DON'T GET ANGRY
WITH ME.


19. WE HAVE QUITE A SIZEABLE POPULATION, 800,000,000


PEOPLE. SOME SAY EVEN LARGER. WE HAVE SO MANY PEOPLE

THAT IT IS NOT QUITE CLEAR EVEN TO OURSELVES HOW MANY
PEOPLE WE HAVE. IT SEEMS TO ME THAT WE HAVE NOT LESS

THAN 800,000,000 PEOPLE. BUT IF YOU GO BY FIGURES
AND TOTAL UP THE VARIOUS PROVINCES, YOU WOULD BE

SCARED TO DEATH. WE HAVE AT LEAST 900,000,000 PEOPLE.
SUCH WORDS CANNOT BE BELIEVED. THEQJHAVE THEIR AIMS

IN PRESENTING THESE FIGURES. WHAT THEY MEAN IS - MY
POPULATION IS GROWING. I NEED MORE CONSTRUCTION.

THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE MUST TAKE NOTE AND ALLOCATE
FUNDS ACCORDINGLY. BUT I THINK THERE ARE AROUND

800,000,000 PEOPLE AND THAT IS WHY WE MUST GO IN FOR


FAMILY PLANNING. THIS HASBEGUN TO BE EFFECTIVE,

INCLUDING IN THE COUNTRYSIDE. IT HAS BEEN EFFECTIVE
IN THECITY FOR MANY YEARS BECAUSE THE LEVEL OF AWARE-

NESS IN URBAN AREAS IS HIGHER IN THIS RESPECT
PERHAPS BECAUSE OF HIGHER EDUCATION. AND AT PRESENT

WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OFEDUCATION AND CULTURE IN THE









COUNTRYSIDE THE RURAL POPULATION IS ACCEPTING FAMILY
PLANNING MORE AND MORE. IT SEEMS THAT THE POPULATION

OF THE UNITED STATES COULD BE INCREASED A BIT. WHAT IS
THE AREA OF YOUR COUNTRY AND WHAT IS THE POPULATION?

(ONE OF THE DELEGATION MEMBERS TELLS VICE PREMIER LI
THAT THE AREA OF THE UNITED STATES IS ABOUT THE SAME AREA AS

CHINA ANDTHAT THEPOPULATION IS AROUND 225 MILLION).
BUT WE HAVE 800,000,000 AND YOU HAVE ONLY 200 MILLION.
IN COMPARISON IT SEEMS TO ME THAT YOU HAVE TO DEVELOP

YOUR POPULATION A BIT MORE. IS THAT NOT POSSIBLE?


20. GROUP MEMBER: WE WILL TRY OUR BEST TO BE DILI-
GENT.


21. LI: SO PERHAPS THE ONLY THING WE CAN SAY IS THAT

WE WILL NOT INTERFERE IN YOUR DOMESTIC AFFAIRS. AND
WHAT WE ARE DOING IN CHINA IS ONLY EDUCATION, PROPA-

GANDA AND PERSUASION. BUT IT IS ARDUOUS EDUCATION AND
HARD PERSUASTION. AND FOR US, WE STILL WISH TO MAKE PEOPLE

AGREE WITH FAMILY PLANNING ON A VOLUNTARY BASIS. IT
WILL NOT DO TO ENGAGE IN COMMANDISM. IT SEEMS THAT THE

POLICY OF INDIRA GANDHI WAS INCORRECT, NOR WILL IT DO
TO ENFORCE OPERATIONS OR ABORTIONS. HOW CAN YOU

HAVE YOUR GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS GO OUT INTO THE STREETS AND
GRAB PEOPLE AND FORCE THEM TO HAVE OPERATIONS. PEOPLE
SIMPLY WILL NOT ACCEPT THAT. THAT WILL NOT DO. PER-

PHAS THAT IS ONE OF THE REASONS WHY MRS. GHANDI LOST
HER ELECTION. I HAVE BEEN GOING ON TOO LONG.

22. DELEGATION MEMBER: IF I COULD RETURN TO YOUR

ANSWER TO THE FIRST QUESTION, YOU MENTIONED THAT WE
ARE IN A DEFENSIVE POSTURE AND THE SOVIETS IN AN

OFFENSIVE POSTURE. I MIGHT POINT OUT THAT THAT IS IN
ACCORD WITH THE WISHES OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. THE

FOUNDATION OF OUR POLICY IS DEFENSIVE. THE BASIS OF
THIS POSTURE IS NATO, WHICH IS A DEFENSIVE ALLIANCE.
THE UNITED STATES HAS ALWAYS BEEN THIS WAY. IN THIS

THE UNITED STATES AND CHINA AGREE.


23. LI: IN THE PAST YOU HAVE LAUNCHED YOUR OFFENSI-
VES TOO.


24.DELEGATION MEMBER: WE MIGHT NOT AGREE ON WHETHER

THEY WERE OFFENSIVE OR DEFENSIVE.



25. LI: I SAY THAT THEY ARE OFFENSIVE. OF COURSE

THAT BELONGS TO THE PAST.










26. DELEGATION MEMBER: SO WE SHOULD AGREE TO LEAVE

IT IN THE PAST. ON ANGOLA I WISH TO MAKE A POINT. THE
SOVIETS AND THE CHINESE WERE BOTH ACTIVE IN ANGOLA

BEFORE THE PORTUGUESE FORCES LEFT. I MIGHT POINT OUT
THAT THIS WAS BEFORE THE EUROPEAN CONFERENCE ON SECURITY.


27. LI: WHAT I WAS TALKING ABOUT IS THE CUBAN MER-
CENARIES WENT INTO ANGOLA WITH SOVIET BACKING AFTER

THE COUNCIL ON SECURITY AND COOPERATION IN EUROPE.


28. DELEGATION MEMBER: OH, THAT'S TRUE.


29. LI: AS FOR THE PERIOD BEFORE THE CUBAN TROOPS
ENTERED ANGOLA WITH SOVIET SUPPORT, WE HAD SUPPORTED

THE THREE FACTIONS IN ANGOLA. OF COURSE, OUR SUPPORT
CONFIDENTIAL


CONFIDENTIAL


PAGE 04    PEKING 01173 05 OF 07 100750Z


WAS DIFFERENT IN NATURE. WE SUPPORTED THESE FACTIONS

AGAINST PORTUGUESE COLONIALISM WHILE THE SOVIET UNION
TRIED TO MEDDLE UNDER THE SIGNBOARD OF ANTI-COLONIALISM
WITH A PURPOSE OF INSERTING THEIR PAWNS INTO THAT AREA.

THEY SUPPORTED ONE FACTION AGAINST THE OTHERS.


30. DELEGATION MEMBER: MORE IMPORTANTLY, MR. VICE
PREMIER, WEHVRE ALL CONCERNED ABOUT TAIWAN. I AM

SURE THAT EACH TIME THE AMERICAN PEOPLE HAVE MADE
KNOWN THEIR POSITION ON TAIWAN THEY HAVE POINTED OUT

THAT THEY DESIRE A PEACEFUL SOLUTION. THE LEADERS OF
THE UNITED STATES ARE IN CLOSE TOUCH WITH THE MASSES

THROUGH OUR ELECTORAL PROCESS, THAT IS, THROUGH THE
AMERICAN ELECTIONS. IN THE SHANGHAI COMMUNIQUE THE

US SIDE REAFFIRMED ITS INTEREST IN A PEACEFUL SETTLEMENT
OF THE TAIWAN PROBLEM AND SAID IT WOULD WITHDRAW ITS

MILITARY FORCES AS TENSIONS IN THE AREA DIMINISHED.
OUR CONCERN IS THAT ON THE EVE OF OUR DEPARTURE AND

AFTER WE ARE HEARING THE CHINESE LEADERS INDICATE THAT
IT WILL BE NECESSARY TO USE FORCE TO LIBERATE TAIWAN.
THIS THREAT IS A NEW ELEMENT, AN ELEMENT NOT MENTIONED

IN THE SHANGHAI COMMUNIQUE. THAT IS, YOUR RECENT
STATEMENTS THAT YOU ARE DETERMINED TO USE FORCE OR THE

THREAT OF FORCE TO LIBERATE TAIWAN. WE ARE CONCERNED
ABOUT THE IMPACT OF SUCH STATEMENTS ON AMERICAN PUBLIC

OPINION WHICH LIMITS OUR GOVERNMENT'S FLEXIBILITY IN
REACHING A SOLUTION TO THE TAIWAN PROBLEM.


31. LI: THAT IS NOT CORRECT. WHEN WE TALK ABOUT

NOT RESORTING TO FORCE, THAT PERTAINS TO THE SINO-US
ASPECT. IN THE SHANGHAI COMMUNIQUE IT WAS STATED THAT

WE BELIEVED WE SHOULD NOT RESORT TO FORCE OR THREAT OF









FORCE IN RELATION TO OTHER STATES OR IN SETTLING
INTERNATIONAL DISPUTES, WHICH IN THIS CASE MEANS BE-

TWEEN THEPEOPLE OF THE UNITED STATES AND CHINA.

STATES &quot;THE UNITED STATES REAFFIRMS ITS INTEREST IN A

PEACEFULSETTLEMENT OF THE TAIWAN QUESTION BY THE
CHINESE THEMSELVES. WITH THIS PROSPECT IN MIND IT

AFFIRMS THE ULTIMATE OBJECTIVE OF THE WITHDRAWAL OF
ALL U.S. FORCES AND MILITARY INSTALLATIONS FROM

TAIWAN. IN THE MEANTIME, IT WILL PROGRESSIVELY REDUCE
ITS FORCES AND MILITARY INSTALLATIONS ON TAIWAN AS

THE TENSION IN THE AREA DIMINISHES.&quot; THE REASON I POINT

THIS OUT IS OUR CONCERN THAT RECENT STATEMENTS BY
CHINESE LEADERS CREATE TENSION RATHER THAN DIMINISH

TENSION, AND THIS CAUSES GREAT CONCERN AMONG THE
AMERICAN PEOPLE AS EXPRESSED IN PUBLIC OPINION POLLS.

AMERICAN LEADERS THEREFORE SEE IT AS MORE DIFFICULT
TO RESOLVE. OF COURSE WE ALL RECOGNIZE THAT THIS

IS YOUR INTERNAL AFFAIR. BUT IT IS ALSO AN AFFAIR









OF CONCERN TO THE UNITED STATES AND EVEN THE VICE
PREMIER'S STATEMENT THAT YOU ARE WILLING TO SIT DOWN

WITH US RECOGNIZES THAT THERE IS AN AMERICAN INTEREST.
WHETHER IT IS REASONABLE OR ILLEGITIMATE, THE US

DOES HAVE AN INTEREST. THIS NEW DEVELOPMENT MOVES
AWAY FROM A SETTLEMENT.


32. LI: THERE IS NO NEW DEVELOPMENT IN THE CHINESE

POSITION. THIS HAS BEEN OUR CONSISTENT POSITION.
BUT YOU ALWAYS STRESS THE US OPINION AND THE

EXPRESSION OF THAT OPINION IN YOUR POLICY. WHY DON'T
YOU GIVE EMPHASIS TO THE POSITION OF THE CHINESE PEOPLE?

IF THERE WAS A REFERENDUM AMONG THE 800 MILLION PEOPLE
OF CHINA, 95 PERCENT WOULD BE FOR THE IMMEDIATE

LIBERATION OF TAIWAN. YOU SAY THAT THE AMERICAN
CONFIDENTIAL


CONFIDENTIAL


PAGE 02    PEKING 01173 06 OF 07 100740Z


LEADERS ARE IN A DIFFICULT POSITION. WE SAY THAT IF
THE TAIWAN ISSUE IS NOT SETTLED CORRECTLY, HOW WILL WE

FACE OUR PEOPLE.


33. DELEGATION MEMBER: I THINK THAT IN SUCH A CASE
LEADERS OF BOTH COUNTRIES WILL HAVE TO USE WISDOM AND

COMPROMISE AND THUS REACH AGREEMENT. IF BOTH SIDES
FOLLOWED ONLY THE OPINIONS OF THEIR PEOPLE, THAT

IS THE 95 PERCENT OF THE CHINESE PEOPLE WHO FAVOR
LIBERATION OF TAIWAN, AND THE MAJORITY OF US PUBLIC

OPINION WHICH FAVORS A PEACEFUL SETTLEMENT, IF WE
FOLLOW ONLY THESE OPIIIONS THEN WE WOULDN'T BE

SITTING HERE TODAY. AND THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN NO
SHANGHAI COMMUNIQUE.


34. LI: I CANNOT AGREE THAT THE SHANGHAI COMMUNIQUE

AND YOUR BEING HERE TODAY ARE IN CONFLICT WITH THE
DESIRES OF OUR TWO PEOPLES. I CAN ONLY SAY THAT THE

VIEWS OF 95 PERCENT OF OUR PEOPLE ARE WELL-KNOWN TO
US AND ALL I CAN DO IN RESPONSE IS TO GIVE YOU THAT

OPINION. IN THE FINAL ANALYSIS, THE TAIWAN ISSUE IS
AN INTERNAL ISSUE AND WE ASK YOU TO CEASE YOUR

INTERFERENCE IN THIS. IF OTHERS INTERFERED IN YOUR AFFAIRS
HOW WOULD YOU REACT?


35. DELEGATION MEMBER: I MIGHT MENTION THAT THERE

WAS A DELEGATION OF MAYORS THAT INCLUDED THE MAYOR
OF SAN JUAN, PUERTO RICO, WHICH ULTIMATELY DID NOT

COME TO VISIT THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA BECAUSE
OF THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA'S POSITION THAT

PUERTO RICO IS NOT A PART OF THE UNITED STATES.

36. LI: THE CHINESE POSITION ON THAT ISSUE WAS STATED










AT THE UNITED NATIONS.


37. DELEGATION MEMBER: WITH REGARD TO NORMALIZATION
CONFIDENTIAL


CONFIDENTIAL


PAGE 03    PEKING 01173 06 OF 07 100740Z


OF RELATIONS, IT IS OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO TELL YOU
FRANKLY WHAT THE VIEWS AND CONSIDERATIONS OF OUR

PEOPLE ARE. WE AR ALL IN AGREEMENT, AS WAS EARLIER
STATED, THAT THIS VISIT WILL ENHANCE UNDERSTANDING

BETWEEN OUR TWO COUNTRIES. THIS KIND OF EXCHANGE IS
NECESSARY IF WE WANT TO CONTINUE THE PROCESS, A

PROCESS THAT MUST GO ON IF WE ARE TO PROCEED TO
NORMALIZATION OF RELATIONS.


38. LI: A VISIT WHICH INCLUDES EXCHANGE OF OPINIONS

CAN BE BENEFICIAL. THERE IS TIME FOR ONE FINAL QUESTION.


39. DELEGATION MEMBER: AS WE CONTINUE OUR VISIT AND
VISIT YOUR PROJECTS, I THINK IT WOULD BE HELPFUL TO

UNDERSTAND THE TOOLS OF MEASUREMENT YOU USE IN
DETERMINING YOUR CAPITAL INVESTMENT. IN OTHER WORDS,
TO UNDERSTAND WHAT METHOD YOU USE TO DECIDE

ABOUT YOUR PRIORITIES. IN THE WEST WE USE A COST
EFFECTIVENESS TECHNIQUE AND WE SIMPLY DON'T UNDERSTAND

WHAT METHOD YOU USE.


40. LI: THIS WILL INVOLVE A HUGE AMOUNT OF INVESTIGATION
AND CAREFUL WEIGHING OF PROS AND CONS AND HEARING

OF VAST OPINIONS. BUT I MUST HONESTLY SAY THAT OUR
PLANNING COMMISSION SOMETIMES MAKES MISTAKES. BUT WE

TRY OUR BEST. WE THINK IT ALLOWABLE TO MAKE MISTAKES.
FIRST WE HOPE THERE ARE NO MISTAKES, BUT SECOND WE CON-

SIDER IT ALLOWABLE TO MAKE SOME MISTAKES. SO WHAT WE
RELY ON MOST OF ALL IS TO LEND AN EAR TO DIFF-

ERENT OPINIONS. LET THE PEOPLE IN THE COAL INDUSTRY,
IN THE STEEL INDUSTRY, HAVE THEIR SAY AND THEN TRY TO

BALANCE THEIR OPINIONS. OF COURSE, THIS IS TROUBLE-
SOME.


41. DELEGATION MEMBER: NO, WHAT I MEANT WAS WHAT

KIND OF METHOD DO YOU USE. FOR EXAMPLE, IN OUR COUN-
TRY WE USE RETURN ON INVESTMENT WITHIN THE GOVERNMENT

AND IN BUSINESS WE USE A COST-BENEFIT ANALYSIS. (SIC)


42. LI: THAT WORKS WITH YOUR GOVERNMENT.


43. DELEGATION MEMBER: WE UNDERSTAND THE COMPETI-
TION BETWEEN VARIOUS INTERESTS BECAUSE THAT IS THE
PROCESS IN OUR OWN GOVERNMENT, ESPECIALLY BUDGET

DEVELOPMENT.


44. LI: IN YOUR COUNTRY PROFITS TAKE COMMAND. FOR

PAGE 02    PEKING 01173 07 OF 07 100705Z


EXAMPLE, IF TODAY THE COAL INDUSTRY TAKES IN THE MOST

PROFITS, THEN MANY OF YOUR INVESTMENTS WILL FLOW IN THAT
DIRECTION. AND WHERE THERE IS SURPLUS, FOR EXAMPLE,

WITH STEEL, INVESTMENTS WILL FLOW IN ANOTHER DIRECTION.
THAT IS NOT THE WAY WE OPERATE. IN AGRICULTURE, FOR

EXAMPLE, WE NOT ONLY DO NOT GO ABOUT IT THAT WAY, WE DO
NOT GET PROFITS BUT IN FACT WE MUST SUBSIDIZE BY MORE
THAN 5 MILLION RMB.


45. DELEGATION MEMBER: THAT IS CORRECT FOR BUSINESS

BUT NOT FOR GOVERNMENT.



46. LI: SO THAT IS THE DIFFERENCE IN OUR SOCIAL

SYSTEMS. PERHAPS IT MAKES IT MORE DIFFICULT TO
UNDERSTAND OUR SYSTEM.


47. LI: SO, ONCE AGAIN LET ME EXPRESS WELCOME TO

ALL THE FRIENDS. I HOPE THAT YOU WILL HAVE A GOOD









VISIT TO MANY PLACES AND THAT YOU WILL SEE AS MUCH
AS POSSIBLE. WHEN YOU VISIT THESE PLACES LOOK WITH

AN EYE TO COMPARING, INCLUDING FIRST OF ALL TO COM-
PARE THINGS TODAY WITH THE WAY THINGS WERE IN PRE-

LIBERATION ERA DURING THE CHIANG KAI-SHEK DAYS. OF
COURSE, WE ALSO ADMIT THAT WE HAVE MANY BACKWARD

ASPECTS. FOR EXAMPLE, IN THE MEANS OF TRANSPORT WE
HAVE BOTH ADVANCED AND VERY BACKWARD MEANS. ON THE
ONE HAND WE HAVE AIRPLANES, SHIPS, TRAINS AND AUTO-

MOBILES. BUT WE ALSO HAVE OXEN CARTS. WE ALSO RELY
ON HUMAN LABOR, SUCH AS PEOPLE PUSHING CARTS OR CARRY-

ING THINGS ON THEIR BACKS. BUT I THINK IT IS GOOD
TO HAVE CANDID EXCHANGES.

CEEDED OUR ALLOTED TIME. WE THANK YOU FOR THIS GOOD
OPPORTUNITY TO HEAR YOU AND TO COME TO THE GREAT HALL OF

PEOPLE. WE OLD PEOPLE ARE MOVING TOWARD DEATH.

ELDERS. TODAY WE HAVE LEARNED MUCH FROM YOU.
