		<h3>Tor</h3>
		<p><a href="https://www.torproject.org">Tor</a> is an encrypted anonymising network that makes it harder to intercept internet communications, or see where communications are coming from or going to.</p>
		<p>In order to use the WikiLeaks public submission system as detailed above you can download the Tor Browser Bundle, which is a Firefox-like browser available for Windows, Mac OS X and GNU/Linux and pre-configured to connect using the anonymising system Tor.</p>
		<h4>Tails</h4>
		<p>If you are at high risk and you have the capacity to do so, you can also access the submission system through a secure operating system called <a href="https://tails.boum.org">Tails</a>. Tails is an operating system launched from a USB stick or a DVD that aim to leaves no traces when the computer is shut down after use and automatically routes your internet traffic through Tor. Tails will require you to have either a USB stick or a DVD at least 4GB big and a laptop or desktop computer.</p>

		<h3>Tips</h3>
		<p>Our submission system works hard to preserve your anonymity, but we recommend you also take some of your own precautions. Please review these basic guidelines. </p>
		<div>
			<h4>1. Contact us if you have specific problems</h4>
			<p>If you have a very large submission, or a submission with a complex format, or are a high-risk source, please <a href="#submit_help_contact">contact us</a>. In our experience it is always possible to find a custom solution for even the most seemingly difficult situations.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h4>2. What computer to use</h4>
			<p>If the computer you are uploading from could subsequently be audited in an investigation, consider using a computer that is not easily tied to you. Technical users can also use <a href="https://tails.boum.org">Tails</a> to help ensure you do not leave any records of your submission on the computer.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h4>3. Do not talk about your submission to others</h4>
			<p>If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in source protection – it is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This includes other media organisations.</p>
		</div>

	</div>

		<h3>After</h3>

		<div>
			<h4>1. Do not talk about your submission to others</h4>
			<p>If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in source protection – it is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This includes other media organisations.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h4>2. Act normal</h4>
			<p>If you are a high-risk source, avoid saying anything or doing anything after submitting which might promote suspicion. In particular, you should try to stick to your normal routine and behaviour.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h4>3. Remove traces of your submission</h4>
			<p>If you are a high-risk source and the computer you prepared your submission on, or uploaded it from, could subsequently be audited in an investigation, we recommend that you format and dispose of the computer hard drive and any other storage media you used.</p>
			<p>In particular, hard drives retain data after formatting which may be visible to a digital forensics team and flash media (USB sticks, memory cards and SSD drives) retain data even after a secure erasure. If you used flash media to store sensitive data, it is important to destroy the media.</p>
			<p>If you do this and are a high-risk source you should make sure there are no traces of the clean-up, since such traces themselves may draw suspicion.</p>
			<div>
				<h4>4. If you face legal action</h4>
				<p>If a legal action is brought against you as a result of your submission, there are organisations that may help you. The Courage Foundation is an international organisation dedicated to the protection of journalistic sources. You can find more details at <a href="https://www.couragefound.org">https://www.couragefound.org</a>.</p>

		<p>WikiLeaks publishes documents of political or historical importance that are censored or otherwise suppressed. We specialise in strategic global publishing and large archives.</p>
		<p>The following is the address of our secure site where you can anonymously upload your documents to WikiLeaks editors. You can only access this submissions system through Tor. (See our <a href="#submit_help_tor">Tor tab</a> for more information.) We also advise you to read our <a href="#submit_help_tips">tips for sources</a> before submitting.</p>

			<!--<div>
				Copy this address into your Tor browser. Advanced users, if they wish, can also add a further layer of encryption to their submission using <a href="#submit_wlkey">our public PGP key</a>.
			</div>-->
		</div>

		<p>If you cannot use Tor, or your submission is very large, or you have specific requirements, WikiLeaks provides several alternative methods. <a href="#submit_help_contact">Contact us</a> to discuss how to proceed.</p>

PRESIDENT'S ASSURANCE IN SHANGHAI THAT HIS &quot;ULTIMATE
OBJECTIVE&quot; WAS WITHDRAWAL OF ALL US FORCES FROM TAIWAN,
5400 TROOPS AND 400 DOD CIVILIANS REMAIN - STILL
MORE THAN THE PRE-VN WAR LEVEL, ACCORDING TO US MILITARY
SPOKESMAN IN TAIWAN.  CONTRARY TO ASSUMPTION THAT

US-GRC RELATIONS WOULD DETERIORATE RAPIDLY, TIE LOOKS
STRONGER THAN AT ANY TIME SINCE SHANGHAI COMMUNIQUE.
THIS WAS UNDERSCORED, IN VIEW OF MOST CHINESE AND
AMERICAN OFFICIALS, BY APPOINTMENT OF &quot;UNEXPECTEDLY
SENIOR AND WELL-KNOWN DIPLOMAT&quot; UNGER, WHO IS TRYING
TO KEEP LOW PROFILE, REFUSING INTERVIEW REQUESTS,
POSSIBLY TO AVOID DRAWING ATTENTION TO HIMSELF AS
SYMBOL OF IMPROVING RELATIONS.

SOME POLITICAL OBSERVERS IN TAIWAN SAY UNEXPECTEDLY
GOOD RELATIONS DUE PARTIALLY TO WATERGATE; THAT NIXON
WAS FORCED TO ABANDON PLAN TO OPEN EMBASSY IN PEKING
BECAUSE HE FEARED LOSING SUPPORT OF ANTI-COMMUNIST
REPUBLICAN CONGRESSMEN IN POSSIBLE IMPEACHMENT VOTE.

ARGUMENTS SUPPORTING VIEW THAT RADICALS ARE GAINING

PRC-US RELATIONS.  CHIANG CHING IS NOW PLAYING ROLE
FAR BEYOND HER NOMINAL PARTY RANKING.  FOR MONTHS
SHE HAS BEEN ELBOWING HER WAY INTO PUBLIC APPEARANCES
WITH CHOU, OFTEN REDUCING HIM TO SECONDARY STATUS
IN OFFICIAL PHOTOS.  IN RECENT DAYS, SHE ENTERTAINED
ON HER OWN GRUNK'S KHIEU SAMPHAN AND PM HEATH.  SOME
OBSERVERS TRIED TO DISMISS HER APPEARANCE AS INTENDED
TO SHOW RADICAL-MODERATE UNITY BY LINING UP WITH
CHOU AND GOVT. OFFICIALS, BUT MORE LIKELY SHE CAME
FORWARD TO RIVAL THE MODERATES.  RIVALRY REACHED
NEW HEIGHT WHEN MAY 22 PEOPLE'S DAILY PUBLISHED ARTICLE
CITING HER 4 TIMES AND QUOTED HER IMMEDIATELY AFTER
QUOTATION FROM MAO, PLAINLY INDICATING THE CONNECTION
OF AUTHORITY.  ALL THIS SEEMS TO CONFIRM GRC INFO
PICTURING CHIANG CHING AS LEADER OF CAMPAIGN TO CRITICIZE
LIN PIAO AND CONFUCIUS.

ANTI-LIN, ANTI-CONFUCIUS CAMPAIGN HAS SINCE FEB 2
BEEN MAIN BATTLEGROUND BETWEEN RADICAL CRITICS OF
CHOU'S POLICIES  AND HIS EFFORTS TO DEFLECT CRITICISM.
CHOU'S STATUS BEGAN TO SLIP ON FEB. 21; HE WAS NO
LONGER GIVEN SOLO HONORS IN RECEIVING FOREIGN GOVT.

28.  NYT'S ANTHONY LEWIS DISCUSSES TAD SZULC'S &quot;REMARKABLE
STUDY&quot; OF KISSINGER'S NEGOTIATING TACTICS IN YEARS
LEADING TO PARIS AGREEMENT APPEARING IN &quot;FOREIGN
POLICY.&quot;  CONCLUSION EMERGES IRRESISTIBLY THAT US
BOMBED NVN OVER CHRISTMAS 1972 IN ORDER TO PERSUADE
SVN TO ACCEPT TRUCE AGREEMENT.  ACCORDING TO SZULC
ACCOUNT, SAYS LEWIS, CONCESSION THAT EVENTUALLY MADE
AGREEMENT POSSIBLE WAS MADE SECRETLY BY US IN APRIL
1972 TO MOSCOW, WHERE HAK TOLD BREZHNEV THAT US WOULD
ACCEPT C-F WITHOUT DEMANDING WITHDRAWAL OF NVN TROOPS
THAT HAD BEEN IN SVN BEFORE APRIL.  SZULC SAYS AS
EARLY AS 1970, NSC STUDY ADVISED HAK THAT HANOI WOULD
NEVER REMOVE ITS TROOPS FROM SVN, INDICATING THAT
CONCESSION WAS RELATED TO PROSPECT OF 1972 ELECTIONS.

HAK'S NEGOTIATING TECHNIQUES AMOUNT TO DECEPTION
TO NOTABLE EXTENT, SAYS LEWIS, TELLING EACH SIDE
UNCLASSIFIED

UNCLASSIFIED

PAGE 12  STATE  117329

WHAT IT WANTS TO HEAR.  IN VN, TECHNIQUE FAILED IN
THE END - AFTER A LAST VIRTUOSO DISPLAY OF TWO-FACED
TACTICS.

IN MAY 1972, DURING NIXON-BREZHNEV SUMMIT, HAK CONFIDED
FURTHER CONCESSIONS TO THE RUSSIANS.  IN JUNE HE
WENT TO PEKING, AND WITH CHOU, TOOK A CONCILIATORY
PHILOSOPHICAL LINE TOWARD HANOI.  THEN IN JULY HE
VISITED THIEU - AND SOUNDED VERY DIFFERENT.  NIXON
ADMIN HAD TO TALK PEACE BECAUSE OF THE UPCOMING ELECTION,
HAK SAID; IT WOULD MAKE SEEMINGLY ATTRACTIVE PROPOSALS,
KNOWING THAT HANOI WOULD REJECT THEM.  AFTER THE
ELECTION, IT WOULD BE A &quot;DIFFERENT STORY;&quot;  US WOULD
NOT HESITATE TO BRING HANOI TO ITS KNEES.  HAK RECOMMENDED
THAT THIEU PLAN AN NVN INVASION AFTER ELECTION.

THIEU WAS NOT TOLD ABOUT US NEGOTIATING CONCESSIONS,
HAK BEING OBVIOUSLY CONFIDENT THAT HE COULD BRING
THIEU ALONG WHEN TERMS WERE AGREED WITH HANOI.  BUT
WHEN SECRET TALKS WITH LE DUC THO PRODUCED DRAFT
AGREEMENT IN OCTOBER, THIEU WAS ANGRY AND RECALCITRANT.
IN MAJOR MOVE TO APPEASE THIEU, US BEGAN RUSHING
1 BILLION DOLS IN NEW MIL EQUIPMENT TO HIM.  ON NOV
20, IN FRESH ROUND OF TALKS WITH THO, HAK READ &quot;FOR
THE RECORD&quot; A SVN DOCUMENT DEMANDING 69 CHANGES IN
TEXT.  AT THAT POINT, ACCORDING LEWIS READING OF
SZULC ARTICLE, N VIETS BEGAN LOOKING AS IF THEY HAD
COLD FEET ABOUT THE WHOLE THING.  ONLY THEN DID HANOI
PROPOSE TEXTUAL CHANGES OF ITS OWN, WHICH HAK DENOUNCED
AS PERFIDIOUS.  CHRISTMAS BOMBING BEGAN, AND BY THE
TIME IT ENDED, THIEU WAS MUCH MORE AGREEABLE.

MANY OUTSIDE OBSERVERS OF TRUCE NEGOTIATIONS FELT
THAT CHRISTMAS BOMBING WAS DESIGNED MAINLY TO BRING
SAIGON ALONG, SINCE BOMBING HAD NO MEASURABLE EFFECT
ON TERMS REACHED WITH HANOI; TEXT SIGNED IN JANUARY
WAS VIRTUALLY IDENTICAL WITH OCTOBER DRAFT.

IN READING SZULC STUDY, ONE PERCEIVES EVEN MORE CYNICAL
POSSIBILITY: HAK MAY HAVE PRESENTED SAIGON'S DEMANDS
ON NOV 20 - DEMANDS HE KNEW WERE UNACCEPTABLE - PRECISELY
UNCLASSIFIED

UNCLASSIFIED

PAGE 13  STATE  117329

IN ORDER TO PROVOKE NEW PROPOSALS FROM HANOI THAT
COULD SERVE AS EXCUSE FOR BOMBING.  LEWIS CONCLUDES
THAT WHATEVER OTHER DIPLOMATIC ACCOMPLISHMENTS HISTORY
CREDITS TO HAK AND PRES, BOMBING EPISODE WILL FOREVER
BLACKEN THEIR NAMES, AND THEIR COUNTRY'S.

THAT FEW CONGRESSMEN TRIED TO ASK THESE QUESTIONS,

CARE THAT MUCH ABOUT VIETNAMESE THESE DAYS.  NOTABLE
EXCEPTION IS INDOCHINA RESOURCE CENTER WHICH, IN
STUDY COLLATING ALL USG AID EFFORTS IN INDOCHINA,
REPORTED THIS WEEK THAT ADMIN &quot;PLANS TO SPEND 3.7
BILLION DOLS IN INDOCHINA FOR FISCAL YEAR 1975 -
MORE THAN THE PROPOSED ECONOMIC AND MILITARY AID
FOR THE REST OF THE WORLD COMBINED.&quot;  IN ANALYZING
23 PROGRAMS FOR SVN, 7 FOR CAMBODIA, AND 6 FOR LAOS,
STUDY SAYS ONLY 31 PERCENT OF AID IS FOR HUMANITARIAN
PURPOSES.  CLAIM OF 31 PERCENT IS ADMIN'S; GUESS
OF CENTER IS 5 PERCENT, ASSUMING THE WORST FOR WHAT
THIEU WILL DO WITH ITEMS LIKE 227 MILLION FOR
&quot;RECONSTRUCTION AND  DEVELOPMENT.&quot;

AMBASSADOR MARTIN HAS ALREADY REVEALED HIMSELF AS
A GUNG-HO, FIGHT-TO-THE-LAST-VIETNAM EXPONENT OF

THAT NGAN TRIED TO USE DEMOCRACY PARTY AND HIS OWN
PERSONAL POWER TO DESTROY THIEU'S CONTROL OF COUNTRY AND,
MORE IMPORTANTLY, ITS BUREAUCRATIC MACHINERY.  HIS
GREATEST MISCALCULATION, IN THIEU'S EYES, WAS SUGGESTION
EARLIER THIS YEAR THAT DP ESTABLISH A POLITBURO TO
DICTATE GOVT. POLICY TO PRES.  SUGGESTION WAS QUICKLY
REJECTED BY THIEU, WHO SHOWS NO SIGN OF WANTING TO SHARE
POWER.  SINCE MAKING RECOMMENDATION, NGAN'S POWER

DIMINISHED STEADILY.  THIEU SEE PARTY AS DEVICE TO GET
OUT THE VOTE AT ELECTION TIME BUT DOES NOT WANT IT TO
BECOME EFFECTIVE FORCE IN GOVT., ACCORDING ONE
OBSERVER.

NGAN WEAKENED HIMSELF FURTHER WITH OTHER MANEUVERS.
UNDER HIS DIRECTION, DP-CONTROLLED LEGISLATURE REJECTED
TWO OF THIEU'S AMBASSADORIAL APPOINTMENTS THIS YEAR
AND REJECTED HIS SELECTION OF NEW HEAD OF SAIGON U.
DIRECTING LAWMAKERS AS IF THERE WERE PUPPETS, NGAN
HAD THEM TAKE STRONG STAND AGAINST CORRUPTION, THREATENING
MANY OF THIEU'S APPOINTEES AND CLOSEST ALLIES.  NGAN
ALSO DIRECTED LEGISLATIVE ATTACKS ON THIEU'S COUSIN,
CONFIDANT AND INFO MIN, HOANG DUC NHA.  EACH EPISODE
EMBARRASSED THIEU AND THREATENED TO WEAKEN THE POWER
BASE HE BUILT.
LAOS
31.  WP'S GREENWAY IN VIENTIANE SEES PL EMERGING
AS DOMINANT POLITICAL FORCE IN LAOS, USUALLY MANAGING
TO HAVE ITS WAY.  PATRIOTIC FRONT APPEALS TO MANY LAOTIANS
AS A PURE AND UNCORRUPTED FORCE WHILE BREATHTAKING
CORRUPTION ON VIENTIANE SIDE HAS DISCREDITED IT AMONG
MUCH OF POPULATION.  CITES DIPLOMATS THAT THE LEFT
PROBABLY WOULD DO VERY WELL IF FREE ELECTIONS WERE
HELD SOON.  GREENWAY TAKES VIEW THAT IF COALITION
WITH COMMUNISTS CAN WORK ANYWHERE, IT CAN WORK IN
LAOS, NOTING LONG-STANDING INTERPERSONAL RELATIONSHIPS
BETWEEN MANY IF NOT MOST LEADERS ON BOTH SIDES.
UNCLASSIFIED

UNCLASSIFIED

PAGE 15  STATE  117329

HOWEVER, GREENWAY FINDS IT HARD TO IMAGINE PATRIOTIC
FRONT LEADERS SPENDING YEARS IN JUNGLE MERELY TO
PRESERVE THE BOURGEOIS COMFORTS OF VIENTIANE SIDE;
THERE ARE HARDER, STERNER MEN STILL IN JUNGLE WHO
MAY EVEN OUTRANK SOUPHANOUVONG IN LAO COMMUNIST PARTY.
GIVEN THE DYNAMICS OF POLITICS IN LAOS TODAY, IT ALSO
HARD TO IMAGINE THAT COMMUNISTS WILL NOT WIN OUT IN THE
END.  GREENWAY INDICATES THIS DEVELOPMENT MIGHT EVEN BE
ACCEPTABLE TO ANTI-COMMUNISTS, CITING ONE (CHANSAMONE
VORAVONG) THAT &quot;LAOS COULD DO WITH A GOOD MEASURE OF
SOCIALISM - ESPECIALLY IN WELFARE AND SOCIAL JUSTICE,
BUT WE HOPE THAT WHATEVER COMES LAOS WILL REMAIN  A
VERY HUMAN COUNTRY.&quot;

32.  IN SEPARATE ARTICLE, GREENWAY (WP) DESCRIBES SITUATION
IN VIENTIANE UNDER JOINT POLICE PATROLS FORMED TWO MONTHS
AGO.  RECALLS THAT WHEN PL SOLDIERS FIRST BEGAN TO ARRIVE
IN TOWN LAST YEAR, THEY WERE GRIM-FACED AND SUSPICIOUS

AFTER DECADE IN JUNGLE; NOW THEY ARE MORE RELAXED AND
FRIENDLY, BUT USUALLY STICK  TO THEMSELVES.  THEY ARE
NOT SEEN IN BARS AND BROTHELS.  ONE PL COMPOUND IS NEXT
TO LAO-AMERICAN SCHOOL, AND PL SOLDIERS HAVE SCOLDED
STUDENTS FOR LEARNING ENGLISH, SAYING IT WILL ONLY MAKE
THEM SUSCEPTIBLE TO US PROPAGANDA.

TO MANY IDEALISTIC VIENTIANE STUDENTS, PL REPRESENT
PURE LAO NATIONALISM UNCORRUPTED BY WESTERN WAYS AND
MONEY.  MANY IN VIENTIANE BELIEVE THAT EVENTUAL CORRUPTION
OF PL IS THEIR ONLY CHANCE TO PRESERVE THE GOOD LIFE.
EVERY TIME A PL MINISTER ORDERS A NEW CAR OR AIR-
CONDITIONER, RIGHT WINGERS IN HIS MINISTRY WILL SMILE
AND NOD KNOWINGLY. THERE IS CERTAIN NERVOUSNESS IN
BUSINESS COMMUNITY OVER WHAT COALITION WILL FINALLY
BRING; MANY ARE PARING DOWN INVENTORIES AND TAKING
WAIT-AND-SEE ATTITUDE.  SO FAR THERE HAS BEEN NO MASS
EXODUS FROM VIENTIANE, ALTHOUGH ONE PROMINENT MADAM
HAS RETURNED TO PARIS.  KISSINGER

PRESIDENT'S ASSURANCE IN SHANGHAI THAT HIS &quot;ULTIMATE

5400 TROOPS AND 400 DOD CIVILIANS REMAIN - STILL
MORE THAN THE PRE-VN WAR LEVEL, ACCORDING TO US MILITARY
SPOKESMAN IN TAIWAN.  CONTRARY TO ASSUMPTION THAT

US-GRC RELATIONS WOULD DETERIORATE RAPIDLY, TIE LOOKS
STRONGER THAN AT ANY TIME SINCE SHANGHAI COMMUNIQUE.
THIS WAS UNDERSCORED, IN VIEW OF MOST CHINESE AND
AMERICAN OFFICIALS, BY APPOINTMENT OF &quot;UNEXPECTEDLY
SENIOR AND WELL-KNOWN DIPLOMAT&quot; UNGER, WHO IS TRYING
TO KEEP LOW PROFILE, REFUSING INTERVIEW REQUESTS,
POSSIBLY TO AVOID DRAWING ATTENTION TO HIMSELF AS
SYMBOL OF IMPROVING RELATIONS.

GOOD RELATIONS DUE PARTIALLY TO WATERGATE; THAT NIXON
WAS FORCED TO ABANDON PLAN TO OPEN EMBASSY IN PEKING
BECAUSE HE FEARED LOSING SUPPORT OF ANTI-COMMUNIST
REPUBLICAN CONGRESSMEN IN POSSIBLE IMPEACHMENT VOTE.

FAR BEYOND HER NOMINAL PARTY RANKING.  FOR MONTHS
SHE HAS BEEN ELBOWING HER WAY INTO PUBLIC APPEARANCES
WITH CHOU, OFTEN REDUCING HIM TO SECONDARY STATUS
IN OFFICIAL PHOTOS.  IN RECENT DAYS, SHE ENTERTAINED

OBSERVERS TRIED TO DISMISS HER APPEARANCE AS INTENDED
TO SHOW RADICAL-MODERATE UNITY BY LINING UP WITH
CHOU AND GOVT. OFFICIALS, BUT MORE LIKELY SHE CAME
FORWARD TO RIVAL THE MODERATES.  RIVALRY REACHED
NEW HEIGHT WHEN MAY 22 PEOPLE'S DAILY PUBLISHED ARTICLE
CITING HER 4 TIMES AND QUOTED HER IMMEDIATELY AFTER
QUOTATION FROM MAO, PLAINLY INDICATING THE CONNECTION
OF AUTHORITY.  ALL THIS SEEMS TO CONFIRM GRC INFO
PICTURING CHIANG CHING AS LEADER OF CAMPAIGN TO CRITICIZE
LIN PIAO AND CONFUCIUS.

ANTI-LIN, ANTI-CONFUCIUS CAMPAIGN HAS SINCE FEB 2
BEEN MAIN BATTLEGROUND BETWEEN RADICAL CRITICS OF
CHOU'S POLICIES  AND HIS EFFORTS TO DEFLECT CRITICISM.

28.  NYT'S ANTHONY LEWIS DISCUSSES TAD SZULC'S &quot;REMARKABLE
STUDY&quot; OF KISSINGER'S NEGOTIATING TACTICS IN YEARS
LEADING TO PARIS AGREEMENT APPEARING IN &quot;FOREIGN
POLICY.&quot;  CONCLUSION EMERGES IRRESISTIBLY THAT US
BOMBED NVN OVER CHRISTMAS 1972 IN ORDER TO PERSUADE
SVN TO ACCEPT TRUCE AGREEMENT.  ACCORDING TO SZULC
ACCOUNT, SAYS LEWIS, CONCESSION THAT EVENTUALLY MADE
AGREEMENT POSSIBLE WAS MADE SECRETLY BY US IN APRIL
1972 TO MOSCOW, WHERE HAK TOLD BREZHNEV THAT US WOULD
ACCEPT C-F WITHOUT DEMANDING WITHDRAWAL OF NVN TROOPS
THAT HAD BEEN IN SVN BEFORE APRIL.  SZULC SAYS AS
EARLY AS 1970, NSC STUDY ADVISED HAK THAT HANOI WOULD
NEVER REMOVE ITS TROOPS FROM SVN, INDICATING THAT
CONCESSION WAS RELATED TO PROSPECT OF 1972 ELECTIONS.

HAK'S NEGOTIATING TECHNIQUES AMOUNT TO DECEPTION
TO NOTABLE EXTENT, SAYS LEWIS, TELLING EACH SIDE
UNCLASSIFIED

UNCLASSIFIED

PAGE 12  STATE  117329

WHAT IT WANTS TO HEAR.  IN VN, TECHNIQUE FAILED IN
THE END - AFTER A LAST VIRTUOSO DISPLAY OF TWO-FACED
TACTICS.

IN MAY 1972, DURING NIXON-BREZHNEV SUMMIT, HAK CONFIDED
FURTHER CONCESSIONS TO THE RUSSIANS.  IN JUNE HE
WENT TO PEKING, AND WITH CHOU, TOOK A CONCILIATORY
PHILOSOPHICAL LINE TOWARD HANOI.  THEN IN JULY HE
VISITED THIEU - AND SOUNDED VERY DIFFERENT.  NIXON
ADMIN HAD TO TALK PEACE BECAUSE OF THE UPCOMING ELECTION,
HAK SAID; IT WOULD MAKE SEEMINGLY ATTRACTIVE PROPOSALS,
KNOWING THAT HANOI WOULD REJECT THEM.  AFTER THE
ELECTION, IT WOULD BE A &quot;DIFFERENT STORY;&quot;  US WOULD
NOT HESITATE TO BRING HANOI TO ITS KNEES.  HAK RECOMMENDED
THAT THIEU PLAN AN NVN INVASION AFTER ELECTION.

THIEU WAS NOT TOLD ABOUT US NEGOTIATING CONCESSIONS,
HAK BEING OBVIOUSLY CONFIDENT THAT HE COULD BRING
THIEU ALONG WHEN TERMS WERE AGREED WITH HANOI.  BUT
WHEN SECRET TALKS WITH LE DUC THO PRODUCED DRAFT
AGREEMENT IN OCTOBER, THIEU WAS ANGRY AND RECALCITRANT.
IN MAJOR MOVE TO APPEASE THIEU, US BEGAN RUSHING
1 BILLION DOLS IN NEW MIL EQUIPMENT TO HIM.  ON NOV
20, IN FRESH ROUND OF TALKS WITH THO, HAK READ &quot;FOR
THE RECORD&quot; A SVN DOCUMENT DEMANDING 69 CHANGES IN
TEXT.  AT THAT POINT, ACCORDING LEWIS READING OF
SZULC ARTICLE, N VIETS BEGAN LOOKING AS IF THEY HAD
COLD FEET ABOUT THE WHOLE THING.  ONLY THEN DID HANOI
PROPOSE TEXTUAL CHANGES OF ITS OWN, WHICH HAK DENOUNCED
AS PERFIDIOUS.  CHRISTMAS BOMBING BEGAN, AND BY THE
TIME IT ENDED, THIEU WAS MUCH MORE AGREEABLE.

MANY OUTSIDE OBSERVERS OF TRUCE NEGOTIATIONS FELT
THAT CHRISTMAS BOMBING WAS DESIGNED MAINLY TO BRING
SAIGON ALONG, SINCE BOMBING HAD NO MEASURABLE EFFECT
ON TERMS REACHED WITH HANOI; TEXT SIGNED IN JANUARY
WAS VIRTUALLY IDENTICAL WITH OCTOBER DRAFT.

IN READING SZULC STUDY, ONE PERCEIVES EVEN MORE CYNICAL
POSSIBILITY: HAK MAY HAVE PRESENTED SAIGON'S DEMANDS
ON NOV 20 - DEMANDS HE KNEW WERE UNACCEPTABLE - PRECISELY

STUDY SAYS ONLY 31 PERCENT OF AID IS FOR HUMANITARIAN
PURPOSES.  CLAIM OF 31 PERCENT IS ADMIN'S; GUESS

THAT NGAN TRIED TO USE DEMOCRACY PARTY AND HIS OWN

MORE IMPORTANTLY, ITS BUREAUCRATIC MACHINERY.  HIS

EARLIER THIS YEAR THAT DP ESTABLISH A POLITBURO TO

DIMINISHED STEADILY.  THIEU SEE PARTY AS DEVICE TO GET
OUT THE VOTE AT ELECTION TIME BUT DOES NOT WANT IT TO
BECOME EFFECTIVE FORCE IN GOVT., ACCORDING ONE
OBSERVER.

NGAN WEAKENED HIMSELF FURTHER WITH OTHER MANEUVERS.
UNDER HIS DIRECTION, DP-CONTROLLED LEGISLATURE REJECTED

CORRUPTION ON VIENTIANE SIDE HAS DISCREDITED IT AMONG
MUCH OF POPULATION.  CITES DIPLOMATS THAT THE LEFT

HOWEVER, GREENWAY FINDS IT HARD TO IMAGINE PATRIOTIC

PRESERVE THE BOURGEOIS COMFORTS OF VIENTIANE SIDE;
THERE ARE HARDER, STERNER MEN STILL IN JUNGLE WHO
MAY EVEN OUTRANK SOUPHANOUVONG IN LAO COMMUNIST PARTY.
GIVEN THE DYNAMICS OF POLITICS IN LAOS TODAY, IT ALSO
HARD TO IMAGINE THAT COMMUNISTS WILL NOT WIN OUT IN THE
END.  GREENWAY INDICATES THIS DEVELOPMENT MIGHT EVEN BE
ACCEPTABLE TO ANTI-COMMUNISTS, CITING ONE (CHANSAMONE
VORAVONG) THAT &quot;LAOS COULD DO WITH A GOOD MEASURE OF
SOCIALISM - ESPECIALLY IN WELFARE AND SOCIAL JUSTICE,
BUT WE HOPE THAT WHATEVER COMES LAOS WILL REMAIN  A
VERY HUMAN COUNTRY.&quot;

AFTER DECADE IN JUNGLE; NOW THEY ARE MORE RELAXED AND

NOT SEEN IN BARS AND BROTHELS.  ONE PL COMPOUND IS NEXT
TO LAO-AMERICAN SCHOOL, AND PL SOLDIERS HAVE SCOLDED
STUDENTS FOR LEARNING ENGLISH, SAYING IT WILL ONLY MAKE
THEM SUSCEPTIBLE TO US PROPAGANDA.

TO MANY IDEALISTIC VIENTIANE STUDENTS, PL REPRESENT
PURE LAO NATIONALISM UNCORRUPTED BY WESTERN WAYS AND
MONEY.  MANY IN VIENTIANE BELIEVE THAT EVENTUAL CORRUPTION
OF PL IS THEIR ONLY CHANCE TO PRESERVE THE GOOD LIFE.
EVERY TIME A PL MINISTER ORDERS A NEW CAR OR AIR-
CONDITIONER, RIGHT WINGERS IN HIS MINISTRY WILL SMILE
