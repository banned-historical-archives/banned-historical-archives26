		<h3>Tor</h3>
		<p><a href="https://www.torproject.org">Tor</a> is an encrypted anonymising network that makes it harder to intercept internet communications, or see where communications are coming from or going to.</p>
		<p>In order to use the WikiLeaks public submission system as detailed above you can download the Tor Browser Bundle, which is a Firefox-like browser available for Windows, Mac OS X and GNU/Linux and pre-configured to connect using the anonymising system Tor.</p>
		<h4>Tails</h4>
		<p>If you are at high risk and you have the capacity to do so, you can also access the submission system through a secure operating system called <a href="https://tails.boum.org">Tails</a>. Tails is an operating system launched from a USB stick or a DVD that aim to leaves no traces when the computer is shut down after use and automatically routes your internet traffic through Tor. Tails will require you to have either a USB stick or a DVD at least 4GB big and a laptop or desktop computer.</p>

		<h3>Tips</h3>
		<p>Our submission system works hard to preserve your anonymity, but we recommend you also take some of your own precautions. Please review these basic guidelines. </p>
		<div>
			<h4>1. Contact us if you have specific problems</h4>
			<p>If you have a very large submission, or a submission with a complex format, or are a high-risk source, please <a href="#submit_help_contact">contact us</a>. In our experience it is always possible to find a custom solution for even the most seemingly difficult situations.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h4>2. What computer to use</h4>
			<p>If the computer you are uploading from could subsequently be audited in an investigation, consider using a computer that is not easily tied to you. Technical users can also use <a href="https://tails.boum.org">Tails</a> to help ensure you do not leave any records of your submission on the computer.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h4>3. Do not talk about your submission to others</h4>
			<p>If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in source protection – it is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This includes other media organisations.</p>
		</div>

	</div>

		<h3>After</h3>

		<div>
			<h4>1. Do not talk about your submission to others</h4>
			<p>If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in source protection – it is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This includes other media organisations.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h4>2. Act normal</h4>
			<p>If you are a high-risk source, avoid saying anything or doing anything after submitting which might promote suspicion. In particular, you should try to stick to your normal routine and behaviour.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h4>3. Remove traces of your submission</h4>
			<p>If you are a high-risk source and the computer you prepared your submission on, or uploaded it from, could subsequently be audited in an investigation, we recommend that you format and dispose of the computer hard drive and any other storage media you used.</p>
			<p>In particular, hard drives retain data after formatting which may be visible to a digital forensics team and flash media (USB sticks, memory cards and SSD drives) retain data even after a secure erasure. If you used flash media to store sensitive data, it is important to destroy the media.</p>
			<p>If you do this and are a high-risk source you should make sure there are no traces of the clean-up, since such traces themselves may draw suspicion.</p>
			<div>
				<h4>4. If you face legal action</h4>
				<p>If a legal action is brought against you as a result of your submission, there are organisations that may help you. The Courage Foundation is an international organisation dedicated to the protection of journalistic sources. You can find more details at <a href="https://www.couragefound.org">https://www.couragefound.org</a>.</p>

		<p>WikiLeaks publishes documents of political or historical importance that are censored or otherwise suppressed. We specialise in strategic global publishing and large archives.</p>
		<p>The following is the address of our secure site where you can anonymously upload your documents to WikiLeaks editors. You can only access this submissions system through Tor. (See our <a href="#submit_help_tor">Tor tab</a> for more information.) We also advise you to read our <a href="#submit_help_tips">tips for sources</a> before submitting.</p>

			<!--<div>
				Copy this address into your Tor browser. Advanced users, if they wish, can also add a further layer of encryption to their submission using <a href="#submit_wlkey">our public PGP key</a>.
			</div>-->
		</div>

		<p>If you cannot use Tor, or your submission is very large, or you have specific requirements, WikiLeaks provides several alternative methods. <a href="#submit_help_contact">Contact us</a> to discuss how to proceed.</p>

</div><div class="text-button" id="showhide">Show&nbsp;Headers</div><div class="text-content"><div id="tagged-text">1. JAPANESE EMBASSY POLITICAL COUNSELOR ARIMA, ACCOMPANIED
BY NUMATA, CALLED ON DAS SULLIVAN FEBRUARY 8TH TO GIVE A
DETAILED DEBRIEFING ON THE DENG-OHIRA CONVERSATION. ARIMA
READ VERBATIM FROM THE REPORTING CABLE RECEIVED FROM TOKYO.
2. OHIRA MET DENG FOR ONE HOUR IN A SMALL GROUP. DENG
SECRETSTATE 037993

WAS ACCOMPANIED BY FANG YI. OHIRA OPENED THE MEETING WITH
CONGRATULATIONS TO DENG ON THE SUCCESS OF HIS TRIP
TO THE UNITED STATES AND AN EXPRESSION OF GRADITUDE FOR
STOPPING IN JAPAN ON THE WAY HOME. OHIRA SAID HE WAS
PARTICULARLY HONORED TO SEE DENG SO SOON AFTER ASSUMING
POSITION AS PRIME MINISTER OF JAPAN.
3. OHIRA STATED THAT EXCHANGES BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES
IN ALL AREAS WERE WIDE AND FREQUENT AND THAT MUTUAL UNDERSTANDING WAS BEING DEEPENED. HE ENCOURAGED FURTHER EX-

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
PANSION. OHIRA NOTED THAT THERE WAS FEVERISH ENTHUSIASM IN
JAPAN TO PUSH FORWARD WITH THE RELATIONSHIP. BUT HE SAID
HE WANTED TO ASK, TO ASSURE A STEADY RELATIONSHIP, WHAT
WERE THE GENERAL OUTLINES OF PRC POLICY REGARDING THE
&quot;FOUR MODERNIZATIONS&quot;. HE SAID THAT BOTH GOVERNMENT AND
PRIVATE PEOPLE COULD DISCUSS INDIVIDUAL PROJECTS, BUT HE
WAS INTERESTED IN A MORE CONCEPTUAL BRIEFING OF THE
FRAMEWORK OF THE MODERNIZATION PROGRAM BECAUSE, IN THE
FINAL ANALYSIS, THE POWER REST WITH GOVERNMENTS, AND IN
MANY CASES THE GOVERNMENTS MUST MAKE FINAL JUDGMENTS.
THEREFORE HE NEEDED FULL INFORMATION. DENG RESPONDED
&quot;FINE&quot;.
4. OHIRA SAID THAT HE WAS LOOKING FORWARD TO A VISIT FROM
PREMIER HUA GUOFENG, AND EXPRESSED HIS FEELING OF BEING
HONORED AT RECEIVING AN INVITATION TO VISIT CHINA. OHIRA
SAID HE WOULD LIKE TO GO, BUT NEEDED TO CONSIDER HIS
POLITICAL CALENDAR BEFORE MAKING COMMITMENT TO A SPECIFIC
DATE.
5. DENG RESPONDED WITH A RENEWAL OF THE INVITATION TO
OHIRA IN THE NAME OF HUA GUOFENG AND THE GOVERNMENT OF
CHINA. HE SAID THAT PREMIER HUA ACCEPTS THE INVITATION
SECRET
PAGE 03

STATE 037993

TO VISIT JAPAN BUT THAT THIS WOULD PROBABLY COME AFTER
OHIRA HAD VISITED THE PRC.
6. OHIRA NOTED THAT IN ASIA THERE ARE PENINSULAS OF
PROBLEMS. HE SAID THAT KOREA IS NO EXCEPTION. ON INDOCHINA, THE JAPANESE GOVERNMENT HOPES THAT CHINA WILL DEAL
WITH THE SITUATION PRUDENTLY AND HOPES THAT PEACE AND
STABILITY WILL BE PRESERVED. HE NOTED THAT CHINA HAS THE
POWER TO RESURRECT PEACE AND STABILITY IN THE AREA. OHIRA
OBSERVED THAT THE GOVERNMENT OF JAPAN APPROACHES THE
ISSUE FROM THIS STANDPOINT AND EXPECTS THAT JAPAN AND
CHINA WILL CONTINUE TO CONSULT ON THIS MATTER.
7. ON KOREA, THE DIALOGUE BETWEEN THE NORTH AND SOUTH IS
NOW BEING CONSIDERED. BUT THUS FAR, OHIRA NOTED, IT HAS
NOT REALLY GONE BEYOND PROPAGANDISTICS. STILL THE CURRENT
MOVEMENT IS A WELCOME SIGN AND HE EXPRESSED HOPE FOR REALIZATION OF THIS DIALOGUE. OHIRA SAID THAT JAPAN AND
CHINA SHOULD COOPERATE TO CREATE AN INTERNATIONAL ATMOSPHERE WHICH WOULD ENABLE THE DIALOGUE TO RESUME. REGARDING JAPAN-NORTH KOREA RELATIONS, OHIRA SAID THAT JAPAN NOW
HAS OCCASIONAL CONTACTS AND CARRIES OUT SOME ECONOMIC AND
CULTURAL EXCHANGE. HE NOTED THE REPUBLIC OF KOREA DESIRES TO HAVE A RELATIONSHIP WITH CHINA EVEN IF ONLY IN
THE ECONOMIC FIELD, AND HE SAID HE WANTED TO TAKE THIS
OPPORTUNITY TO HEAR DENG'S VIEWS. OHIRA SAID HE BELIEVED
THE PROSPECTS FOR PEACE WOULD BE ADVANCED IF SUCH A

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
RELATIONSHIP WERE REALIZED.
8. DENG RESPONDED THAT HE WAS STOPPING IN JAPAN TO REPORT
ON HIS VISIT TO THE UNITED STATES AND IT WAS ONLY NATURAL
TO CALL ON OHIRA AS A FRIEND AFTER HE HAD ASSUMED THE
OFFICE OF PRIME MINISTER. DENG SAID IT WAS USEFUL TO
EXCHANGE VIEWS ON BILATERAL ISSUES, ON MATTERS RELATING
TO THE ASIAN AND PACIFIC REGION, AND ON THE INTERNATIONAL
SITUATION. IN ADDITION TO REPORTING ON THE US, DENG
SECRET
PAGE 04

STATE 037993

WISHED TO EXCHANGE VIEWS ON INDOCHINA.
9. DENG CONTINUED THAT WHAT OHIRA HAD SAID ABOUT KOREA
WAS SIMILAR TO WHAT PRESIDENT CARTER HAD SAID. WHEN DENG
WAS LAST IN JAPAN HE AND PRIME MINISTER FUKUDA HAD EXCHANGED VIEWS ON THIS. HE SAID IT WAS TRUE THAT THERE
WERE PROPITIOUS SIGNS IN THIS REGARD. NORTH KOREA HAD
MADE A CONCRETE PROPOSAL AND WAS AWAITING A REPLY FROM
THE SOUTH, WHICH PYONGYANG EXPECTED WOULD BE POSITIVE.
IN THIS RESPECT, DENG SAID THAT JAPAN, CHINA, AND THE
UNITED STATES SHOULD BE ABLE TO PERFORM THE ROLE OF PROMOTERS OR ENCOURAGERS. WHEN IN THE UNITED STATES, DENG
SAID, HE HAD EMPHASIZED THAT IT WAS BETTER IF U.S. ARMED
FORCES WERE TO WITHDRAW. DENG SAID THAT THIS WOULD NOT
ADVERSELY AFFECT THE ASIAN AND PACIFIC SITUATION. THE
U.S. FORCES WOULD ONLY BE STEPPING BACK BY ONE HUNDRED
KILOMETERS. AMERICA COULD WITHDRAW AND DISENGAGE FROM
THIS PROBLEM AND BE RELIEVED OF SOME RESPONSIBILITY. THIS
WOULD CONTRIBUTE TO THE NORTH-SOUTH DIALOGUE. (ARIMA DID
NO/NOT INTERPRET THIS TO MEAN THAT DENG WAS ADVOCATING
RENUNCIATION OF THE US-ROK TREATY.) DENG CONTINUED THAT,
ALTHOUGH THE DIALOGUE HAD BEEN SUSPENDED, KIM IL SUNG WAS
THINKING OF STARTING A DIALOGUE NOT ONLY INCLUDING THE
GOVERNMENT BUT ALSO INCLUDING POLITICAL PARTIES AND CONCERNED GROUPS. PRESIDENT CARTER HAD SAID THAT WITHDRAWAL
OF U.S. FORCES WAS UNACCEPTABLE TO SOUTH KOREAN PRESIDENT
PARK, BUT PRESIDENT CARTER SAID HE WOULD &quot;TRY&quot;. (ARIMA
SAID IT WAS UNCLEAR FROM THE RECORD PRECISELY WHAT THIS
MEANT.) REGARDING THE DANGER OF NORTH-SOUTH MILITARY
CONFRONTATION, DENG SAID THAT, AS HE HAD TOLD PRIME
MINISTER FUKUDA IN OCTOBER, HE SEES NO SUCH DANGER. &quot;I
SHOULD THINK&quot; NO SUCH DANGER WOULD EXIST EVEN AFTER THE
U.S. MILITARY WITHDRAWAL. RECENTLY THE NORTH HAD PROPOSED
SECRET
PAGE 05

STATE 037993

NEITHER SHOULD TAKE MILITARY ACTION AND SHOULD CONSULT
PEACEFULLY. DENG WENT ON TO ADD THAT IF ONE COMPARES
MILITARY STRENGTH OF THE NORTH AND THE SOUTH, THE SOUTH
WAS NOT WEAKER. THEREFORE, WITHDRAWAL OF THE U.S. TROOPS

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
WOULD PROMOTE THE DIALOGUE.
10. REGARDING SOUTH KOREA'S HOPES FOR AT LEAST ECONOMIC
RELATIONS WITH CHINA, DENG SAID THAT UNDER PRESENT CIRCUMSTANCES SUCH AN ARRANGEMENT WOULD BE OF NO USE. AS FOR
CHINA, THE CHINESE WOULD LIKE TO EXERT EFFORTS FROM A
DIFFERENT ANGLE TRANSCENDING ALL OF THIS, NAMELY NOT
INTERFERING IN THE CONFLICT BETWEEN NORTH AND SOUTH.
SUCH AN APPROACH WOULD INCREASE THE CHANCES OF SUCCESS,
DENG SAID.
11. DENG THEN TURNED TO THE PROBLEM OF INDOCHINA. HE
NOTED THE ESPECIALLY LARGE-SCALE VIETNAMESE INVASION OF
CAMBODIA WAS A MATTER OF CONCERN NOT ONLY FOR CHINA BUT
ALSO FOR THE ASIAN AND PACIFIC REGION INCLUDING JAPAN,
AND FOR THE INTERNATIONAL SITUATION. THIS HAS COME TO
FORM AN IMPORTANT ASPECT OF SOVIET GLOBAL STRATEGY, DENG
NOTED. HE SAID HE WAS NOT SUGGESTING THAT FAILURE TO DEAL
WITH THIS SKILLFULLY WOULD IMMEDIATELY LEAD VIETNAM TO
INVADE CHINA. BUT, HE SAID, UNLESS WE GIVE VIETNAM
NECESSARY SANCTION AND PUNISHMENT, VIETNAM WOULD PLACE LAOS
UNDER ITS CONTROL, OCCUPY CAMBODIA, AND THEREAFTER TRY TO
INTIMIDATE THE ASEAN COUNTRIES. DENG SAID THAT THE SOVIET
UNION IS TAKING ADVANTAGE OF VIETNAM, REACHING FOR ASEAN,
AND AIMING FOR THE FINLANDIZATION OF ASEAN. WE NEED TO BE
MINDFUL OF THIS HE SAID. IT IS NO ACCIDENT THAT THE
SOVIET UNION IS RAISING THE IDEA OF AN ASIAN COLLECTIVE
SECURITY SYSTEM AFTER A TWO YEAR INTERVAL. IN SUBSTANCE
THIS MEANS FINLANDIZATION AND IS SIMPLY A SOVIET ATTEMPT
AT OBTAINING CONTROL.
SECRET
PAGE 06

STATE 037993

12. DENG THEN TURNED TO THE MIDDLE EAST SAYING THAT THE
PROBLEMS THERE REMAIN UNRESOLVED. HE CITED SPECIFICALLY
IRAN AND AFGHANISTAN. HE ALSO INDICATED THAT THERE ARE
SIGNS OF IMMINENT PROBLEMS IN PAKISTAN. ALL OF THIS, DENG
COMMENTED, HE HAD MENTIONED TO PRESIDENT CARTER. THE U.S.
HAD EXPRESSED CONCERN THAT THERE MAYARISE A PROBLEM IN
SAUDI ARABIA AS WELL. IN HIS VISIT TO THE U.S., DENG
SAID HE HAD POINTED OUT TO A NUMBER OF POLITICIANS THAT
THE SOVIET UNION HAS BECOME IMPETUOUS BECAUSE IT WAS NOT
TAUGHT A LESSON OR PUNISHED AT THE TIME OF THE CUBAN
CRISIS AND THAT THE U.S. BETTER TAKE EFFECTIVE ACTIONS
WITH RESPECT TO IRAN. DENG SAID THERE IS STILL ROOM FOR
U.S. MANEUVERING, BUT THE TIME IS RUNNING OUT AND WE
SHOULD TAKE STRONG ACTIONS AGAINST HEGEMONISM AND CONSISTENTLY TAKE PUNITIVE ATTITUDES.
13. NOW, SAID DENG, VIETNAM IS TAKING CRAZY ACTIONS. IT
HAS TAKEN CONTROL OF LAOS AND USING HO CHI MINH ROUTES

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
AND HAS SENT BETWEEN ONE HUNDRED AND TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND
SOLDIERS TO CAMBODIA. HE SAID THERE HAS BEEN CONSTANT
TURMOIL ON THE SINO-VIETNAMESE BORDER OVER THE LAST YEAR
OR SO WHICH THE VIETNAMESE HAVE NOW ESCALATED. IN THE
INDIAN OCEAN THE SOVIETS ARE TRYING TO STRETCH THEIR
INFLUENCE TO THE MIDDLE EAST AND SOUTHWEST ASIA AND IN THE
EAST ARE TRYING TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF VIETNAM. BETWEEN
THE TWO LIE THE MALACCA STRAITS.
14. DENG SAID THAT THERE IS LEGITIMATE REASON FOR SOUTHEAST ASIA TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT THE VIETNAMESE INVASION
OF CAMBODIA. HE SAID IT WAS OF A MILITARY CHARACTER BASED
ON THE VIETNAMESE TREATY WITH THE SOVIET UNION. IT WAS
OF A PIECE WITH SOVIET STRATEGY IN BUILDING UP ITS
STRENGTH IN THE PACIFIC INCLUDING ITS FLEET AND ON THE
SECRET
PAGE 07

STATE 037993

NORTHERN ISLANDS OF JAPAN. HE NOTED THAT ACTIVITY WAS AT
A HIGH PITCH. HE SAID THAT THE SOVIETS HAVE SUFFERED
SOME DEFEATS AS IN SOMALIA AND EGYPT, AND EVEN IN INDIA
RELATIONS ARE NOT AS GOOD AS THEY WERE UNDER MRS. GHANDI.
BUT IN ALL OTHER AREAS THEY ARE GAINING BENEFITS.
15. DENG SAID THAT THE UNITED NATIONS WAS SHOWING A
FAVORABLE RESPONSE IN THAT ONLY THE SOVIET UNION AND ITS
COHORTS WERE SUPPORTING VIETNAMESE ACTION.
16. THE SOVIETS ARE TAKING ADVANTAGE OF SOUTHWEST ASIA,
DENG OBSERVED, AND THERE IS A SOUTHWARD PUSH BY THE
SOVIETS IN COMBINATION WITH VIETNAM. THIS IS OF CONCERN.
FOR EXAMPLE, INDIA IS NOW SEEKING TO IMPROVE RELATIONS
WITH ITS NEIGHBORS, AND YET DESAI SAID HIS GOVERNMENT
WILL RECOGNIZE THE CAMBODIAN REGIME IF REQUESTED. WE MUST,
DENG SAID, PREVENT ASEAN FROM ADOPTING THIS ATTITUDE.
17. SOVIET ACTION, WHICH TAKES ADVANTAGE OF VIETNAM, RELATES NOT ONLY TO CHINA BUT ALSO JAPAN, DENG STATED. THE
LIFELINE OF JAPAN IS THE ROUTE THROUGH THE MALACCA
STRAIT. FOR EXAMPLE JAPAN IMPORTS TWENTY PERCENT OF ITS
OIL FROM IRAN AND THIS ROUTE IS OF CRITICAL IMPORTANCE TO
JAPAN. CHINA HAD THOUGHT ABOUT THIS SERIOUSLY BEFORE
VISITING THE UNITED STATES, DENG SAID. THERE IS NO WAY
TO DEAL WITH THE CUBANS AS THEY HAVEALREADY BECOME
IMPETUOUS, DENG NOTED, BUT WE WOULD HAVE BAD RESULTS IF
WE STOOD BY AS VIETNAM ACTED. THE UNITED STATES AND
OTHERS SHOULD PUNISH VIETNAM. WE THINK, DENG SAID, THERE
ARE LIMITS TO PUNISHMENT. CHINA IS NOT UNAWARE OF A
POSSIBLE DANGER OF REACTION FROM THE NORTH. CHINA WILL
SHOULDER SUCH DANGER, HOWEVER, TO GIVE SUCH PUNISHMENTS
AS ARE NECESSARY FOR CHINA AND FOR THE REGION.
18. OHIRA RESPONDED THAT DENG'S VIEWS WERE EDIFYING AND

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
THANKED HIM FOR HIS PROFOUND INSIGHTS AND IDEAS. THE

STATE 037993

JAPANESE HAVE BEEN WARNING VIETNAM, HE SAID, THAT UNLESS
THEY TAKE PEACEFUL ACTION AS JAPAN HAS SUGGESTED THE
GOVERNMENT OF JAPAN CANNOT CONSIDER ECONOMIC COOPERATION.
JAPAN WOULD LIKE TO BE MINDFUL OF ANXIETIES OF ASEAN AND
OF THE VIEWS OF CHINA IN DEALING WITH THIS SITUATION.
19. DENG SAID THAT HE HAD PRESENTED CHINA'S VIEWS TO
PRESIDENT CARTER IN THE FORM OF A THREE POINT SUMMARY:
-- A. CHINA HAS REPEATEDLY ISSUED WARNINGS; WHATEVER
CHINA SAYS IT WILL DO IT WILL WITHOUT FAIL DO.
-- B. CHINESE ACTIONS ARE TAKEN ONLY AFTER SERIOUS
THOUGHT.
-- C. THE CHINESE WOULD NEVER ACT RASHLY AND FOOLISHLY.
20. THE VISIT TO THE UNITED STATES WAS A GREAT SUCCESS,
DENG REPORTED. IT WAS POSITIVE AND CONSTRUCTIVE. NOT
ALL ISSUES WERE AGREED BUT EVERYTHING WAS TOUCHED ON.
HE HAD NOT WANTED TO TALK ABOUT HUMAN RIGHTS BECAUSE CHINA
HAD ITS OWN VIEWS ON HUMAN RIGHTS IN THE UNITED STATES.
HE EMPHASIZED DETENTE, DENG SAID, TALKING ABOUT HOW
TENSIONS WERE INCREASING AND HOW UNITED STATES WAS IN
COMPETITION WITH SOVIET HEGEMONY. THE U.S. HAS WON IN
EGYPT AND SOMALIA. BUT IN ANGOLA, CHINA AND FRANCE GAVE
MORAL AND MILITARY ASSISTANCE EVEN THOUGH THEY WERE
CRITICIZED. CHINA WOULD HAVE HOPED THAT THE UNITED
STATES WOULD HAVE ACTED IN THE SAME WAY, AND DENG SAID HE
HAD TOLD THIS TO PRESIDENT CARTER.
21. DENG THEN REPEATED THE THEME ABOUT FAILING TO PUNISH
SECRET
PAGE 09

STATE 037993

CUBA AND HOW THIS HAD LED TO UNFETTERED ACTIONS. HE SAID
THE U.S. SHOULD PAY MORE ATTENTION TO ONE HUNDRED MILLION
ARABS RATHER THAN THREE MILLION ISRAELIS. HE ADVOCATED
THE POSITION OF PRESIDENT SADAT ON THE MIDDLE EAST
QUESTION.
22. BECAUSE OF A SERIES OF SOVIET ACTIONS WHICH ARE NOT
CONTROLLED, DENG NOTED THAT WE FACE THE SITUATION AS TODAY IN IRAN. THE U.S. WAS ALSO WORRIED ABOUT SAUDI
ARABIA, AND THESE WERE OBVIOUSLY RELATED ISSUES.
23. DENG TOLD THE UNITED STATES THAT IT WOULD SERIOUSLY

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
ASSIST PAKISTAN, AND THE UNITED STATES SAID IT WAS INTERESTED IN THE LIFE OF BHUTTO. WHEN LI XIANNIAN AND
VISITED PAKISTAN, PRESIDENT ZIA HAD SAID THAT THERE WAS
NO DANGER TO THE LIFE OF BHUTTO. DENG SAID HE REPORTED
THIS TO THE UNITED STATES. (ARIMA INTERJECTED AT THIS
POINT THAT THERE IS NO REFERENCE TO THE NON-PROLIFERATION
ISSUE). DENG INDICATED THAT AS FAR AS BHUTTO WAS CONCERNED, HE HAD CONVEYED THE U.S. VIEWS. (ARIMA COMMENTED
THAT THERE WAS A SUGGESTION THAT CHINA HAD PUT SOME
PRESSURE ON AS WELL.)
24. REGARDING VIETNAM, DENG SAID THAT THE UNITED STATES
FELT THAT ESCALATION OF THE SITUATION WAS NOT FAVORABLE.
DENG HAD RESPONDED THAT CHINA WOULD KEEP THE U.S. VIEW IN
MIND BUT WOULD ACT ON ITS OWN.
25. CAMBODIA HAS ITS OWN MILITARY FORCES, DENG OBSERVED,
AND HAS NOT SUFFERED DAMAGE. CHINA HOPES AS MANY COUNTRIES
AS POSSIBLE WILL AID CAMBODIA.
26. REGARDING VIETNAM, THE PRC UNDERSTANDS THAT JAPAN IS
KEEPING PACE WITH THE ASEAN COUNTRIES BY TEMPORARILY
SUSPENDING ASSISTANCE TO VIETNAM. DENG SAID HE HOPED
SECRET
PAGE 10

STATE 037993

THAT JAPAN WOULD GO BEYOND THIS TO AID CAMBODIA.
27. DENG REPORTED THAT IN THE DISCUSSIONS WITH PRESIDENT
CARTER THEY HAD THEN GONE ON TO VARIOUS BILATERAL ISSUES
INCLUDING PROPERTIES, MFN, ETC. SOME WORKING AGREEMENTS
HAD BEEN SIGNED. MAINTENANCE OF CLOSE WORKING RELATIONS
WITH THE UNITED STATES WOULD NOT AFFECT CHINESE RELATIONS
WITH JAPAN OR EUROPE, DENG NOTED.
28. OHIRA RESPONDED THAT IT WAS GRATIFYING THAT THROUGH
THE DENG VISIT TO THE UNITED STATES THERE HAD BEEN A
DEEPENING OF UNDERSTANDING BETWEEN THE U.S. AND CHINA.
BOTH COUNTRIES ARE POWERS WITH WORLD INFLUENCE AND IT IS
USEFUL TO EXCHANGE VIEWS. HE THANKED DENG FOR HIS EXPLANATION.
29. OHIRA WENT ON TO SAY THAT JAPAN WOULD LIKE TO CONTINUE TO WORK ENERGETICALLY FOR PEACE AND STABILITY OF
THE REGION AND THAT THEY WANTED A CONSTANT EXCHANGE OF
VIEWS WITH CHINA ON THESE PROBLEMS AND TO CARRY OUT EXCHANGE OF VISITS BY LEADERS AND BY OTHERS IN VARIOUS
CIRCLES AND LEVELS SO AS TO DEEPEN RELATIONS AND UNDERSTANDING.
30.FOREIGN MINISTER SONODA SAID THAT AS REGARDS AID TO
CAMBODIA, JAPAN REMAINS INTERESTED IN MOVING AHEAD BUT

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
THAT POL POT MAY REALLY NOT BE POPULAR IN ASIA. HE
WONDERED ALOUD WHETHER CHINA'S INTEREST WAS IN ASSISTING
CAMBODIA AS A NATION OR IN ASSISTING THE POL POT REGIME.
31. DENG RESPONDED THAT CHINA DID NOT APPROVE OF ALL
POLICIES OF POL POT. BUT HE SAID NOW IS NOT THE TIME

TO BE CONCERNED WITH SUCH MATTERS. BEIJING HAD INVITED
SIHANOUK TO CHINA BUT HE HAD SAID FIRST THAT HE WAS NOT
INVOLVED IN POLITICS AND WOULD LIKE TO THINK IT OVER.
LATER HE WENT. POL POT SAID HE WANTS TO ORGANIZE A
PATRIOTIC FRONT, AND DENG ASKED THAT JAPAN GIVE HEED TO
THIS. VANCE

SUBJECT:DENG XIAOPING CONVERSATION WITH JAPANESE PRIME
MINISTER OHIRA
SECRET ENTIRE TEXT.
1. JAPANESE EMBASSY POLITICAL COUNSELOR ARIMA, ACCOMPANIED
BY NUMATA, CALLED ON DAS SULLIVAN FEBRUARY 8TH TO GIVE A
DETAILED DEBRIEFING ON THE DENG-OHIRA CONVERSATION. ARIMA
READ VERBATIM FROM THE REPORTING CABLE RECEIVED FROM TOKYO.
2. OHIRA MET DENG FOR ONE HOUR IN A SMALL GROUP. DENG
SECRET

WAS ACCOMPANIED BY FANG YI. OHIRA OPENED THE MEETING WITH
CONGRATULATIONS TO DENG ON THE SUCCESS OF HIS TRIP
TO THE UNITED STATES AND AN EXPRESSION OF GRADITUDE FOR
STOPPING IN JAPAN ON THE WAY HOME. OHIRA SAID HE WAS
PARTICULARLY HONORED TO SEE DENG SO SOON AFTER ASSUMING
POSITION AS PRIME MINISTER OF JAPAN.
3. OHIRA STATED THAT EXCHANGES BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES
IN ALL AREAS WERE WIDE AND FREQUENT AND THAT MUTUAL UNDERSTANDING WAS BEING DEEPENED. HE ENCOURAGED FURTHER EX-

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
PANSION. OHIRA NOTED THAT THERE WAS FEVERISH ENTHUSIASM IN
JAPAN TO PUSH FORWARD WITH THE RELATIONSHIP. BUT HE SAID
HE WANTED TO ASK, TO ASSURE A STEADY RELATIONSHIP, WHAT
WERE THE GENERAL OUTLINES OF PRC POLICY REGARDING THE
&quot;FOUR MODERNIZATIONS&quot;. HE SAID THAT BOTH GOVERNMENT AND
PRIVATE PEOPLE COULD DISCUSS INDIVIDUAL PROJECTS, BUT HE
WAS INTERESTED IN A MORE CONCEPTUAL BRIEFING OF THE
FRAMEWORK OF THE MODERNIZATION PROGRAM BECAUSE, IN THE
FINAL ANALYSIS, THE POWER REST WITH GOVERNMENTS, AND IN
MANY CASES THE GOVERNMENTS MUST MAKE FINAL JUDGMENTS.
THEREFORE HE NEEDED FULL INFORMATION. DENG RESPONDED
&quot;FINE&quot;.
4. OHIRA SAID THAT HE WAS LOOKING FORWARD TO A VISIT FROM
PREMIER HUA GUOFENG, AND EXPRESSED HIS FEELING OF BEING
HONORED AT RECEIVING AN INVITATION TO VISIT CHINA. OHIRA
SAID HE WOULD LIKE TO GO, BUT NEEDED TO CONSIDER HIS
POLITICAL CALENDAR BEFORE MAKING COMMITMENT TO A SPECIFIC
DATE.
5. DENG RESPONDED WITH A RENEWAL OF THE INVITATION TO
OHIRA IN THE NAME OF HUA GUOFENG AND THE GOVERNMENT OF
CHINA. HE SAID THAT PREMIER HUA ACCEPTS THE INVITATION
SECRET
PAGE 03

STATE 037993

TO VISIT JAPAN BUT THAT THIS WOULD PROBABLY COME AFTER
OHIRA HAD VISITED THE PRC.
6. OHIRA NOTED THAT IN ASIA THERE ARE PENINSULAS OF
PROBLEMS. HE SAID THAT KOREA IS NO EXCEPTION. ON INDOCHINA, THE JAPANESE GOVERNMENT HOPES THAT CHINA WILL DEAL
WITH THE SITUATION PRUDENTLY AND HOPES THAT PEACE AND
STABILITY WILL BE PRESERVED. HE NOTED THAT CHINA HAS THE
POWER TO RESURRECT PEACE AND STABILITY IN THE AREA. OHIRA
OBSERVED THAT THE GOVERNMENT OF JAPAN APPROACHES THE
ISSUE FROM THIS STANDPOINT AND EXPECTS THAT JAPAN AND
CHINA WILL CONTINUE TO CONSULT ON THIS MATTER.
7. ON KOREA, THE DIALOGUE BETWEEN THE NORTH AND SOUTH IS
NOW BEING CONSIDERED. BUT THUS FAR, OHIRA NOTED, IT HAS
NOT REALLY GONE BEYOND PROPAGANDISTICS. STILL THE CURRENT
MOVEMENT IS A WELCOME SIGN AND HE EXPRESSED HOPE FOR REALIZATION OF THIS DIALOGUE. OHIRA SAID THAT JAPAN AND
CHINA SHOULD COOPERATE TO CREATE AN INTERNATIONAL ATMOSPHERE WHICH WOULD ENABLE THE DIALOGUE TO RESUME. REGARDING JAPAN-NORTH KOREA RELATIONS, OHIRA SAID THAT JAPAN NOW
HAS OCCASIONAL CONTACTS AND CARRIES OUT SOME ECONOMIC AND
CULTURAL EXCHANGE. HE NOTED THE REPUBLIC OF KOREA DESIRES TO HAVE A RELATIONSHIP WITH CHINA EVEN IF ONLY IN
THE ECONOMIC FIELD, AND HE SAID HE WANTED TO TAKE THIS
OPPORTUNITY TO HEAR DENG'S VIEWS. OHIRA SAID HE BELIEVED
THE PROSPECTS FOR PEACE WOULD BE ADVANCED IF SUCH A

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
RELATIONSHIP WERE REALIZED.
8. DENG RESPONDED THAT HE WAS STOPPING IN JAPAN TO REPORT
ON HIS VISIT TO THE UNITED STATES AND IT WAS ONLY NATURAL
TO CALL ON OHIRA AS A FRIEND AFTER HE HAD ASSUMED THE
OFFICE OF PRIME MINISTER. DENG SAID IT WAS USEFUL TO
EXCHANGE VIEWS ON BILATERAL ISSUES, ON MATTERS RELATING
TO THE ASIAN AND PACIFIC REGION, AND ON THE INTERNATIONAL
SITUATION. IN ADDITION TO REPORTING ON THE US, DENG
SECRET
PAGE 04

STATE 037993

WISHED TO EXCHANGE VIEWS ON INDOCHINA.
9. DENG CONTINUED THAT WHAT OHIRA HAD SAID ABOUT KOREA
WAS SIMILAR TO WHAT PRESIDENT CARTER HAD SAID. WHEN DENG
WAS LAST IN JAPAN HE AND PRIME MINISTER FUKUDA HAD EXCHANGED VIEWS ON THIS. HE SAID IT WAS TRUE THAT THERE
WERE PROPITIOUS SIGNS IN THIS REGARD. NORTH KOREA HAD
MADE A CONCRETE PROPOSAL AND WAS AWAITING A REPLY FROM
THE SOUTH, WHICH PYONGYANG EXPECTED WOULD BE POSITIVE.
IN THIS RESPECT, DENG SAID THAT JAPAN, CHINA, AND THE
UNITED STATES SHOULD BE ABLE TO PERFORM THE ROLE OF PROMOTERS OR ENCOURAGERS. WHEN IN THE UNITED STATES, DENG
SAID, HE HAD EMPHASIZED THAT IT WAS BETTER IF U.S. ARMED
FORCES WERE TO WITHDRAW. DENG SAID THAT THIS WOULD NOT
ADVERSELY AFFECT THE ASIAN AND PACIFIC SITUATION. THE
U.S. FORCES WOULD ONLY BE STEPPING BACK BY ONE HUNDRED
KILOMETERS. AMERICA COULD WITHDRAW AND DISENGAGE FROM
THIS PROBLEM AND BE RELIEVED OF SOME RESPONSIBILITY. THIS
WOULD CONTRIBUTE TO THE NORTH-SOUTH DIALOGUE. (ARIMA DID
NO/NOT INTERPRET THIS TO MEAN THAT DENG WAS ADVOCATING
RENUNCIATION OF THE US-ROK TREATY.) DENG CONTINUED THAT,
ALTHOUGH THE DIALOGUE HAD BEEN SUSPENDED, KIM IL SUNG WAS
THINKING OF STARTING A DIALOGUE NOT ONLY INCLUDING THE
GOVERNMENT BUT ALSO INCLUDING POLITICAL PARTIES AND CONCERNED GROUPS. PRESIDENT CARTER HAD SAID THAT WITHDRAWAL
OF U.S. FORCES WAS UNACCEPTABLE TO SOUTH KOREAN PRESIDENT
PARK, BUT PRESIDENT CARTER SAID HE WOULD &quot;TRY&quot;. (ARIMA
SAID IT WAS UNCLEAR FROM THE RECORD PRECISELY WHAT THIS
MEANT.) REGARDING THE DANGER OF NORTH-SOUTH MILITARY
CONFRONTATION, DENG SAID THAT, AS HE HAD TOLD PRIME
MINISTER FUKUDA IN OCTOBER, HE SEES NO SUCH DANGER. &quot;I
SHOULD THINK&quot; NO SUCH DANGER WOULD EXIST EVEN AFTER THE
U.S. MILITARY WITHDRAWAL. RECENTLY THE NORTH HAD PROPOSED
SECRET
PAGE 05

STATE 037993

NEITHER SHOULD TAKE MILITARY ACTION AND SHOULD CONSULT
PEACEFULLY. DENG WENT ON TO ADD THAT IF ONE COMPARES
MILITARY STRENGTH OF THE NORTH AND THE SOUTH, THE SOUTH
WAS NOT WEAKER. THEREFORE, WITHDRAWAL OF THE U.S. TROOPS

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
WOULD PROMOTE THE DIALOGUE.
10. REGARDING SOUTH KOREA'S HOPES FOR AT LEAST ECONOMIC
RELATIONS WITH CHINA, DENG SAID THAT UNDER PRESENT CIRCUMSTANCES SUCH AN ARRANGEMENT WOULD BE OF NO USE. AS FOR
CHINA, THE CHINESE WOULD LIKE TO EXERT EFFORTS FROM A
DIFFERENT ANGLE TRANSCENDING ALL OF THIS, NAMELY NOT
INTERFERING IN THE CONFLICT BETWEEN NORTH AND SOUTH.
SUCH AN APPROACH WOULD INCREASE THE CHANCES OF SUCCESS,
DENG SAID.
11. DENG THEN TURNED TO THE PROBLEM OF INDOCHINA. HE
NOTED THE ESPECIALLY LARGE-SCALE VIETNAMESE INVASION OF
CAMBODIA WAS A MATTER OF CONCERN NOT ONLY FOR CHINA BUT
ALSO FOR THE ASIAN AND PACIFIC REGION INCLUDING JAPAN,
AND FOR THE INTERNATIONAL SITUATION. THIS HAS COME TO
FORM AN IMPORTANT ASPECT OF SOVIET GLOBAL STRATEGY, DENG
NOTED. HE SAID HE WAS NOT SUGGESTING THAT FAILURE TO DEAL
WITH THIS SKILLFULLY WOULD IMMEDIATELY LEAD VIETNAM TO
INVADE CHINA. BUT, HE SAID, UNLESS WE GIVE VIETNAM
NECESSARY SANCTION AND PUNISHMENT, VIETNAM WOULD PLACE LAOS
UNDER ITS CONTROL, OCCUPY CAMBODIA, AND THEREAFTER TRY TO
INTIMIDATE THE ASEAN COUNTRIES. DENG SAID THAT THE SOVIET
UNION IS TAKING ADVANTAGE OF VIETNAM, REACHING FOR ASEAN,
AND AIMING FOR THE FINLANDIZATION OF ASEAN. WE NEED TO BE
MINDFUL OF THIS HE SAID. IT IS NO ACCIDENT THAT THE
SOVIET UNION IS RAISING THE IDEA OF AN ASIAN COLLECTIVE
SECURITY SYSTEM AFTER A TWO YEAR INTERVAL. IN SUBSTANCE
THIS MEANS FINLANDIZATION AND IS SIMPLY A SOVIET ATTEMPT
AT OBTAINING CONTROL.

12. DENG THEN TURNED TO THE MIDDLE EAST SAYING THAT THE
PROBLEMS THERE REMAIN UNRESOLVED. HE CITED SPECIFICALLY
IRAN AND AFGHANISTAN. HE ALSO INDICATED THAT THERE ARE
SIGNS OF IMMINENT PROBLEMS IN PAKISTAN. ALL OF THIS, DENG
COMMENTED, HE HAD MENTIONED TO PRESIDENT CARTER. THE U.S.
HAD EXPRESSED CONCERN THAT THERE MAYARISE A PROBLEM IN
SAUDI ARABIA AS WELL. IN HIS VISIT TO THE U.S., DENG
SAID HE HAD POINTED OUT TO A NUMBER OF POLITICIANS THAT
THE SOVIET UNION HAS BECOME IMPETUOUS BECAUSE IT WAS NOT
TAUGHT A LESSON OR PUNISHED AT THE TIME OF THE CUBAN
CRISIS AND THAT THE U.S. BETTER TAKE EFFECTIVE ACTIONS
WITH RESPECT TO IRAN. DENG SAID THERE IS STILL ROOM FOR
U.S. MANEUVERING, BUT THE TIME IS RUNNING OUT AND WE
SHOULD TAKE STRONG ACTIONS AGAINST HEGEMONISM AND CONSISTENTLY TAKE PUNITIVE ATTITUDES.
13. NOW, SAID DENG, VIETNAM IS TAKING CRAZY ACTIONS. IT
HAS TAKEN CONTROL OF LAOS AND USING HO CHI MINH ROUTES

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
AND HAS SENT BETWEEN ONE HUNDRED AND TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND
SOLDIERS TO CAMBODIA. HE SAID THERE HAS BEEN CONSTANT
TURMOIL ON THE SINO-VIETNAMESE BORDER OVER THE LAST YEAR
OR SO WHICH THE VIETNAMESE HAVE NOW ESCALATED. IN THE
INDIAN OCEAN THE SOVIETS ARE TRYING TO STRETCH THEIR
INFLUENCE TO THE MIDDLE EAST AND SOUTHWEST ASIA AND IN THE
EAST ARE TRYING TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF VIETNAM. BETWEEN
THE TWO LIE THE MALACCA STRAITS.
14. DENG SAID THAT THERE IS LEGITIMATE REASON FOR SOUTHEAST ASIA TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT THE VIETNAMESE INVASION
OF CAMBODIA. HE SAID IT WAS OF A MILITARY CHARACTER BASED
ON THE VIETNAMESE TREATY WITH THE SOVIET UNION. IT WAS
OF A PIECE WITH SOVIET STRATEGY IN BUILDING UP ITS
STRENGTH IN THE PACIFIC INCLUDING ITS FLEET AND ON THE

DENG OBSERVED, AND THERE IS A SOUTHWARD PUSH BY THE
SOVIETS IN COMBINATION WITH VIETNAM. THIS IS OF CONCERN.
FOR EXAMPLE, INDIA IS NOW SEEKING TO IMPROVE RELATIONS
WITH ITS NEIGHBORS, AND YET DESAI SAID HIS GOVERNMENT
WILL RECOGNIZE THE CAMBODIAN REGIME IF REQUESTED. WE MUST,
DENG SAID, PREVENT ASEAN FROM ADOPTING THIS ATTITUDE.
