		<h3>Tor</h3>
		<p><a href="https://www.torproject.org">Tor</a> is an encrypted anonymising network that makes it harder to intercept internet communications, or see where communications are coming from or going to.</p>
		<p>In order to use the WikiLeaks public submission system as detailed above you can download the Tor Browser Bundle, which is a Firefox-like browser available for Windows, Mac OS X and GNU/Linux and pre-configured to connect using the anonymising system Tor.</p>
		<h4>Tails</h4>
		<p>If you are at high risk and you have the capacity to do so, you can also access the submission system through a secure operating system called <a href="https://tails.boum.org">Tails</a>. Tails is an operating system launched from a USB stick or a DVD that aim to leaves no traces when the computer is shut down after use and automatically routes your internet traffic through Tor. Tails will require you to have either a USB stick or a DVD at least 4GB big and a laptop or desktop computer.</p>

		<h3>Tips</h3>
		<p>Our submission system works hard to preserve your anonymity, but we recommend you also take some of your own precautions. Please review these basic guidelines. </p>
		<div>
			<h4>1. Contact us if you have specific problems</h4>
			<p>If you have a very large submission, or a submission with a complex format, or are a high-risk source, please <a href="#submit_help_contact">contact us</a>. In our experience it is always possible to find a custom solution for even the most seemingly difficult situations.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h4>2. What computer to use</h4>
			<p>If the computer you are uploading from could subsequently be audited in an investigation, consider using a computer that is not easily tied to you. Technical users can also use <a href="https://tails.boum.org">Tails</a> to help ensure you do not leave any records of your submission on the computer.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h4>3. Do not talk about your submission to others</h4>
			<p>If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in source protection – it is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This includes other media organisations.</p>
		</div>

	</div>

		<h3>After</h3>

		<div>
			<h4>1. Do not talk about your submission to others</h4>
			<p>If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in source protection – it is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This includes other media organisations.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h4>2. Act normal</h4>
			<p>If you are a high-risk source, avoid saying anything or doing anything after submitting which might promote suspicion. In particular, you should try to stick to your normal routine and behaviour.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h4>3. Remove traces of your submission</h4>
			<p>If you are a high-risk source and the computer you prepared your submission on, or uploaded it from, could subsequently be audited in an investigation, we recommend that you format and dispose of the computer hard drive and any other storage media you used.</p>
			<p>In particular, hard drives retain data after formatting which may be visible to a digital forensics team and flash media (USB sticks, memory cards and SSD drives) retain data even after a secure erasure. If you used flash media to store sensitive data, it is important to destroy the media.</p>
			<p>If you do this and are a high-risk source you should make sure there are no traces of the clean-up, since such traces themselves may draw suspicion.</p>
			<div>
				<h4>4. If you face legal action</h4>
				<p>If a legal action is brought against you as a result of your submission, there are organisations that may help you. The Courage Foundation is an international organisation dedicated to the protection of journalistic sources. You can find more details at <a href="https://www.couragefound.org">https://www.couragefound.org</a>.</p>

		<p>WikiLeaks publishes documents of political or historical importance that are censored or otherwise suppressed. We specialise in strategic global publishing and large archives.</p>
		<p>The following is the address of our secure site where you can anonymously upload your documents to WikiLeaks editors. You can only access this submissions system through Tor. (See our <a href="#submit_help_tor">Tor tab</a> for more information.) We also advise you to read our <a href="#submit_help_tips">tips for sources</a> before submitting.</p>

			<!--<div>
				Copy this address into your Tor browser. Advanced users, if they wish, can also add a further layer of encryption to their submission using <a href="#submit_wlkey">our public PGP key</a>.
			</div>-->
		</div>

		<p>If you cannot use Tor, or your submission is very large, or you have specific requirements, WikiLeaks provides several alternative methods. <a href="#submit_help_contact">Contact us</a> to discuss how to proceed.</p>

LI: YOU SHOULD COME IN AUGUST OR SEPTEMBER WHEN THE
WEATHER IS BETTER.
SLACK: I WAS HERE IN AUGUST 1975 AND I ALSO VISITED
THE GREAT WALL. THE TREES HAD MANY LEAVES THEN.
LI: THERE ARE NOT MANY TREES AT THE GREAT WALL. YOU
CAME HERE IN 1975 WHEN WE HAD GREAA DIFFICULTIES. AT
THAT TIME OUR PEOPLE WRE NOT HAPPY. AND THEN IN

MAO PASSED AWAY. THERE WAS ALSO THE EARTHQUAKE. ON
TOP OF THAT A HANDFUL OF PEOPLE INSIDED THE PARTY WANTED
TO SPLIT THE PARTY AND THE COUNTRY. I AM TALKING ABOUT
THE GANG OF FOUR. OF COURSE, YOU WOULDN'T HAVE NOWN
THAT AT THE TIME. THE STRUGGLE WAS ACUTE. OUR
PEOPLE DID NOT LIKE THEM. UNDER THE LEADERSHIP OF

OF FOUR. THE PEOPLE WERE THEN IN HIGH SPIRITS. I
THINK YOU CAN SEE FOR YOURSELF THAT HE PEOPLE ARE IN
HIGH SPIRITS. YOU CAN COMPARE. WHERE ARE YOU GOING
TOMORROW?

DIDN'T ALLOW THEM. WE SAID THAT THERE WERE REIPAIRS
GOING ON THERE. OF COURSE, THAT WAS NOT TRUE. HANGCHOW
WAS NOT UNDEROGOING REPAIRS. THERE WASFACTIONAL FIGHTING. WILL YOU GO TO TIBET (LAUGHTER)? IF ANY OF

WHETHER IT IS AGRICULTURE, INDUSTRY, SCIENCE AND
TECHNOLOGY ORCULTURE, WE ARE NOT DEVELOPED. THE
GAP IS VERY BIG. EVEN COMPARED TO THE SOVIET UNION,

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
THE SOVIET UNION IS MORE POWERFUL. THEY ARE POWERFULL
BUT WE ARE NOT AFRAID.
BUT COMPARED TO OUR PAST, 29 YEARS AGO, WE HAVE DONE
QUITE A LOT. AT THAT TIME WE WERE UNDER THE RULE
OF CHIANG KAI-SHEK. GRICULTURE WAS BACKWARD.
THEEE WAS NOT ENOUGH FOOD AND PEOPLE DIED OF SKTARVATION. NO ONE KNOWS HOW MANY DIED OF COLD,
STARVATION AND DISEASE. SOME SAY SEVERAL MILLION
OTHERS SAY 10 MILLION. NOW NO ONE DIES OF STARVATION
OR OF COLD. WE HAVE REDUCED DISEASE GREATLY. NOW OUR
INDUSTRY IS NOT VERY POWERFUL BUT WE HAVE A BIT
OF EVERYTHING.
PREVIOUSLY WE HAD TEXTILES, CIGARETTES, MATCHES AND
SOME OTHER LIGHT INDUSTRY. WE ALSO HAD A SMALL COAL
INDUSTRY. WE DID NOT HAVE ANY MACHINE BUILDING
INDUSTRY; ONLY SOME CAPACITY TO REPAIR. THESE COMPANIES SERVED FOREIGN MONOPOLIES, CAPITALIST SAND ALSO
SEVRVED THE COMPRADOR CAPITALISTS. THERE WAS VIRTUALLY
NO STEEL INDUSTRY. IN THE NORTHEAST THERE WAS AN IRON

AND STEEL PLANT IN ANSHAN THAT PRODUCED 900,000 TONS
PER YEAR. DURING WORLD WAR II THE PLANT WAS DAMAGED
AND AFTER THE WAR THE SOVIETS TOOK AWAY THE MACHINERY.
THERE WAS NO OIL INDUSTRY, NO CHEMICAL INDUSTRY AND NO
ELECTRONICS INDUSTRY. OF COURSE, TRANSISTOR RADIOS
WERE NOT YET INVENTED. I WILL TELL YOU A JOKE. IN
THE 50'S JAPAN RAN AN INDUSTRIAL EXHIBITION IN PEKING.
THERE WERE SOME TRANSISTOR RADIOS. OUR PEOPLE DIDN'T
KNOW WHAT THEY WERE. WE ALSO DID NOT HAVE A WATCH
INDUSTRY.
NOWE WE HAVE ALL OF THESE THINGS. NOW WE CAN PRODUCE
30 MILLION TONS OF STEEL. COMPARED TO THE UNITED
STATES, THIS IS BACKWARD. NOW WE PRODUCE 100 MILLION
TONS OF COAL. THAT IS ENOUGH TO MEET OUR OWN NEEDS
AND EXPORT A LITTLE. THEN YOU MIGHT ASK THE QUESTION:
WHERE DOES THE CAPITAL COME FROM? WE RELY ON OUR OWN
EFFORTS. WE RELIED ENTIRELY ON OUR OWN EFFORTS AT
THAT TIME. WE TOOK OVER THE LAND THAT THE LANDLORDS
TOOK FROM THE PEASANTS. WE TOOK OVER THE MONOPLY
CAPITAL THAT WAS CONTROLLED BY CHIANG KAI-SHEK. WITH
ALL OF THAT MONEY WE BUILT UP INDUSTRY, AGRICULTURE AND
NATIONAL DEFENSE.
WE ALSO BORROWED MONEY FROM THE SOVIET UNION IN THE
EARLY 50'S WHEN STALIN WAS IN POWER. WHEN KHRUSCHEV
CAME TO POWER HE PRESSED US FOR PAYMENT. WE WENT
INTO DEBT TO BUY WEAPONS. AT THAT TIME SINO-US RELATIONS WERE VERY UNPLEASANT. THERE WAS A WAR IN KOREA.
SINCE KHRUSHCHEV PRESSED HARD FOR REPYAMENT, WE HAD NO

FOUND THAT OUR PEOPLE DON'T EAT AND DRESS VERY WELL.
REGARDI G THE ALLOCATION OF FUNDS, AGRICULTURE HAS THE
TOP PRIORITY. AGRICULTURAL PRODUCE IS STILL A BIG
PROBLEM FOR US. IT IS NOT AS STRONG AS YOURS. AFTER
AGRICULTURE, THEN COMES BASIC INDUSTRY -- IRON, STEEL,
COAL, OIL, ELECTRICITY AND COMMUNICATIONS. AT THE
SAME TIME WE ARE DEVELOPING LIGHT INDUSTRY. WE
ALSO DEVELOP SCIENCE AND CULTURE. WITHOUT SCIENCE AND
TECHNOLOGY IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO GO AHEAD WITH CONSTRUCTION. NOW WE ARE MODIFYING OUR POLICY A LITTLE BIT. OF
COURSE, WE RELY MAINLY ON OUR OWN EFFORTS. THE CHANGE
IN OUR POLICY IS THIS: WHEN IT IS NOT DETRIMENTAL TO
OUR SOVEREIGNTY WE WILL ACCEPT LOANS FROM COUNTRIES IF
THEY WANT TO MAKE THEM. THIS IS IN DIFFERENT FORMS:
(1) WE CAN BUY THE EQUIPMENT AND THEN PAY IN INSTALLMENTS; (2) CREDITS CAN BE PROVIDED FROM FOREIGN BANKS
TO THE BANK OF CHINA; (3) WE USE THEIR EQIUPMENT; AFTER
THE EQUIPMENT IS IN PRODUCTION WE REPAY WITH THE
PRODUCT PRODUCED, FOR EXAMPLE, IN COAL, OIL, NONFERROUS METALS AND OTHER THINGS. WE ARE CONSIDERING
RUNNING JOINT ENTERPRISES WITH FOREIGN CAPITALISTS.
ROUGHLY SPEAKING THESE ARE THE FORMS. NOW WE ARE
DOING THIS WITH JAPAN, WEST GERMANY AND FRANCE.
WE HAVE A LONG TERM TRADE AGREEMENT WITH JAPAN. WE
WILL POSSIBLY SIGN ONE WITH WEST GERMANY AND
FRANCE.
IN ADDITION, WE HAVE SOME CONTACTS WITH YOUR COMPANIES
PROVIDED THE CONDITIONS ARE SUITABLE AND THE PRICE IS
COMPETITIVE. BUT COMPARED WITH OUR RELATIONS WITH
JAPAN AND WESTERN EUROPE, OUR RELATIONS WITH YOU
SUFFER FROM THE LACK OF DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS. WE ASK
YOU TO HELP US. NOT LONG AGO THE SECRETARY OF AGRICULTURE

FACT THAT WE ARE NOT SELF-SUFFICIENT.
IN A WORD WE ARE DETERMINED TO ACHIEVE THE FOUR
MODERNIZATIONS. WE WANT TO CATCH UP WITH YOU AND WITH
EUROPE. THAT WILL TAKE SOME TIME. WE DON'T HAVE A
SOLID FOUNDATION. THE FOUNDATION LAID BY CHIANG
KAI-SHEK WAS TOO WEAK. BUT THE GREATER PART OF HIS
HERITAGE IS THE LARGE CHINESE POPULATION. NOW WE
HAVE MORE THAN 800 MILLION PEOPLE. HOW MANY DO YOU
HAVE? 200 MILLION?
SLACK: 225 MILLION I THINK.
LI: I THINK YOUR COUNTRY COULD SUPPORT 5-600 MILLION.
ANDREWS: WE HAVE GOT TO GET TO WORK (LAUGHTER).
LI: PERHAPS WE HAVE TOO MANY PEOPLE. WE HAVE BEEN
WORKING TO BRING DOWN THE BIRTH RATE THROUGH FAMILY
PLANNING. IT IS NOT EASY. WE HAVE MADE SOME PROGRESS. IF WE LET IT GO THERE WILL BE AN INCREASE OF
20 MILLION BABIES PER YEAR. NOW THE ANNUAL INCREASE
IS ABOUT 10 MILLION BABIES.

MIGHT NOT BE IN KEEPING WITH ACTUAL CONDITIONS. THEY
REPORT MORE PEOPLE AND GREATER BIRTH RATE; THEN
THEY
ASK THE CENTER TO INVEST MORE MONEY IN THAT AREA.
ROUGHLY SPEAKING THESE FIGURES CONFORM TO REALITY,
HOWEVER. THEY ALSO REPORT LESS REVENUE. FOR 20
YEARS I WAS THE MINISTER OF FINANCE. I STARTED IN
1954 AND IN 1974 I WAS REMOVED (THE CHINESE LAUGH).
NOW I AM NO LONGER MINISTER OF FINANCE. THERE ARE
A LOT OF PROBLEMS AND A LOT OF SQUABBLING BETWEEN THE
MINISTRIES AND THE PROVINCES AND BETWEEN THE DIFFERENT
MINISTRIES. THEY PUT THE BLAME ON ME. I SAID THAT
YOU SHOULD BEAR THE BLAME; I REMAIN A GOOD MAN
(LAUGHTER). SO THERE ARE OTHER PROBLEMS. THE
PEOPLE WANTED MORE AND I GAVE THEM LESS. BUT IN OUR
COUNTRY DECISIONS ARE NOT MADE INDIVIDUALLY BUT
COLLECTIVELY. BOTH CHAIRMAN MAO AND PREMIER CHOU
GAVE ME SUPPORT. THEY SAID I A M A GOOD MAN. THEY
ARE GOOD MEN TOO.
REGARDING SOUTHEAST ASIA, WE HAVE GOOD RELATIONS WITH
ALMOST ALL ASEAN COUNTRIES EXCEPT INDONESIA AND
SINGAPORE. ALTHOUGH THERE ARE NO DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS WITH SINGAPORE WE HAVE GOOD DISCUSSIONS WITH
THEM. NOT LONG AGO VICE PREMIER TENG HSIAO-PING
VISITED SINGAPORE. ALTHOUGH WE HAVE NO DIPLOMATIC
RELATIONS WITH INDONESIA OUR TWO COUNTRIES UNDERSTAND EACH OTHER'S POSITIONS. WE HAVE CONTACTS AND WE
WILL GRADUALLY COME TO AN AGREEMENT ON MANY ISSUES.
THIS IS BECAUSE WE HAVE EXPRESSED SUPPORT FOR THE
ASEAN POLICY OF PEACE, FREEDOM, AND NEUTRALITY. WE
ALSO HAVE FRIENDLY RELATIONS WITH BURMA. OUR RELATIONS WITH VIETNAM ARE NOT GOOD. WE USED TO SUPPORT
THEM. BEFORE 1975 VIETNAM WAS AT WAR. WE SUPPORTED

THEM. OF COURSE, THERE WERE CONTRADICTIONS BUT THEY
WERE NOR BROUGHT TO THE SURFACE. VIETNAM WANTS TO
ESTABLISH AN INDOCHINA FEDERATION. THEY WANT TO
BRING KAMPUCHEA AND LAOS UNDER THEIR CONTROL. THEY
WANT THEM AS THEIR APPENDAGES AND WE EXPRESSED OUR
DISAGREEMENT BY REMAINING SILENT. WE COULDN'T AGREE
TO THEIR REGIONAL HEGEMONY. SO THEY REGARDDED US AS
A BIG OBSTACLE AGAINST THEIR REGIONAL HEGEMONY. DOES

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
VIETNAM ONLY WANT AN INDOCHINA FEDERATION?. I DON'T
BELIEVE THAT. THEY WANT ALSO TO SPREAD IT TO ALL OF
SOUTHEAST ASIA.
WE HAVE GOOD RELATIONS WITH JAPAN. OUR RELATIONS HAVE
ENTERED A VERY GOOD STAGE SINCE WE SIGNED THE PEACE
AND FRIENSHIP TREATY. THE PEACE AND FRIENDSHIP TREATY
IS HISTORICALLY IMPORTANT. THE REACTION IN EUROPE,
SOUTHEAST ASIA AND THE US IS VERY FAVORABLE. THE ONLY
ONE OPPOSED WAS THE SOVIET UNION. OF COURSE THAT ALSO
INCLUDES ITS SATELLITE STATES INCLUDING VIETNAM. THEY
OPPOSED US AND THE SIGNING OF THE PEACE AND FRIENDSHIP TREATY. THIS IS BECAUSE THIS TREATY IS AN
OBSTACLE TO THE SOVIET AMBITIONS TO ESABLISH BLOBAL
HEGEMONY AND THE SOVIET AMBITION TO CREATE AN ASIAN
COLLECTIVE SECURITY SYSTEM.
SO VIETNAM'S AMBITION TO CREATE AN INDOCHINA FEDERATION DOVETAILS WITH THE SOVIET AMBITION TO CREATE
AN ASIAN COLLECTIVE SECURITY SYSTEM. NOW THE
SITUATION IS LIKE THIS. YOU HAVE A CUBA IN YOUR
HEMISPHERE. WE HAVE A CUBA IN OUR HEMISPHERE. YOU
HAVE A CASTRO AND WE HAVE A CASTRO. THEY ARE TWO
DOGS. ONCE I TOLD A FOREIGN FRIEND THAT CASTRO WAS A
RUNNING DOG OF THE SOVIET UNION. NO, HE SAID THAT
CASTRO WAS A WILD DOG. NOW I THINK THAT VIETNAM HAS
BECOME A WILD DOG TOO. THEY WANT TO INVADE KAMPUCHEA.
WE GIVE KAMPUCHEA OUR EXPLICIT SUPPORT. THIS IS
BECAUSE KAMPUCHEA IS A VICTIM OF AGGRESSION AND OPPRESSION. THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS A BOUNDARY CONFLICT.

ON. I ADVISE YOU NOT TO TAKE ON THEIR BURDEN. THE BURDEN
IS NOT BIG BUT IT IS DOG DUNG. SOME PEOPLE SAY THAT BY
SUPPLYING AID TO VIETNAM THIS PREVENTS VIETNAM FROM LEANING
TOWARDS THE SOVIET UNION. I TOLD THEM IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE.

YEMEN AND AFGHANISTAN. I THINK THE SOVIET UNION IS TRYING
TO ENCIRCLE EUROPE. I THINK THEY WILL EVENTUALLY MAKE TROUBLE
IN YOUR OIL SUPPLIES IN THE MIDDLE EAST AND YOUR RAW MATERIAL
SUPPLIES FROM AFRICA, BOTH FOR THE US AND WESTERN EUROPE.
YOU WILL HAVE HAD DISARMAMENT TALKS FOR TEN YEARS. AND THERE
HAS NOT BEEN REAL DISARMAMENT. INSTEAD OF DECREASING ITS

PREVIOUSLY WE HAD TEXTILES, CIGARETTES, MATCHES AND

INDUSTRY; ONLY SOME CAPACITY TO REPAIR. THESE COMPANIES SERVED FOREIGN MONOPOLIES, CAPITALIST SAND ALSO
SEVRVED THE COMPRADOR CAPITALISTS. THERE WAS VIRTUALLY

AND AFTER THE WAR THE SOVIETS TOOK AWAY THE MACHINERY.
THERE WAS NO OIL INDUSTRY, NO CHEMICAL INDUSTRY AND NO

WERE NOT YET INVENTED. I WILL TELL YOU A JOKE. IN

THERE WERE SOME TRANSISTOR RADIOS. OUR PEOPLE DIDN'T

WHERE DOES THE CAPITAL COME FROM? WE RELY ON OUR OWN

TOOK FROM THE PEASANTS. WE TOOK OVER THE MONOPLY

CULTURE ARE AT A VERY LOW LEVEL. YOU HAVE PROBABLY
FOUND THAT OUR PEOPLE DON'T EAT AND DRESS VERY WELL.
REGARDI G THE ALLOCATION OF FUNDS, AGRICULTURE HAS THE
TOP PRIORITY. AGRICULTURAL PRODUCE IS STILL A BIG
PROBLEM FOR US. IT IS NOT AS STRONG AS YOURS. AFTER
AGRICULTURE, THEN COMES BASIC INDUSTRY -- IRON, STEEL,
COAL, OIL, ELECTRICITY AND COMMUNICATIONS. AT THE
SAME TIME WE ARE DEVELOPING LIGHT INDUSTRY. WE
ALSO DEVELOP SCIENCE AND CULTURE. WITHOUT SCIENCE AND
TECHNOLOGY IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO GO AHEAD WITH CONSTRUCTION. NOW WE ARE MODIFYING OUR POLICY A LITTLE BIT. OF
COURSE, WE RELY MAINLY ON OUR OWN EFFORTS. THE CHANGE
IN OUR POLICY IS THIS: WHEN IT IS NOT DETRIMENTAL TO
OUR SOVEREIGNTY WE WILL ACCEPT LOANS FROM COUNTRIES IF
THEY WANT TO MAKE THEM. THIS IS IN DIFFERENT FORMS:
(1) WE CAN BUY THE EQUIPMENT AND THEN PAY IN INSTALLMENTS; (2) CREDITS CAN BE PROVIDED FROM FOREIGN BANKS
TO THE BANK OF CHINA; (3) WE USE THEIR EQIUPMENT; AFTER
THE EQUIPMENT IS IN PRODUCTION WE REPAY WITH THE
PRODUCT PRODUCED, FOR EXAMPLE, IN COAL, OIL, NONFERROUS METALS AND OTHER THINGS. WE ARE CONSIDERING
RUNNING JOINT ENTERPRISES WITH FOREIGN CAPITALISTS.
ROUGHLY SPEAKING THESE ARE THE FORMS. NOW WE ARE
DOING THIS WITH JAPAN, WEST GERMANY AND FRANCE.
WE HAVE A LONG TERM TRADE AGREEMENT WITH JAPAN. WE
WILL POSSIBLY SIGN ONE WITH WEST GERMANY AND
FRANCE.
IN ADDITION, WE HAVE SOME CONTACTS WITH YOUR COMPANIES
PROVIDED THE CONDITIONS ARE SUITABLE AND THE PRICE IS
COMPETITIVE. BUT COMPARED WITH OUR RELATIONS WITH
JAPAN AND WESTERN EUROPE, OUR RELATIONS WITH YOU
SUFFER FROM THE LACK OF DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS. WE ASK
YOU TO HELP US. NOT LONG AGO THE SECRETARY OF AGRICULTURE
(LI ASKED TANG WEN-SHENG FOR HIS NAME) CAME. I
THINK MR. WOODCOCK WAS ALSO PRESENT. APART FROM
COOPERATION IN AGRICULTURE AND TECHNOLOGY, WE WILL BUY

FACT THAT WE ARE NOT SELF-SUFFICIENT.
IN A WORD WE ARE DETERMINED TO ACHIEVE THE FOUR
MODERNIZATIONS. WE WANT TO CATCH UP WITH YOU AND WITH
EUROPE. THAT WILL TAKE SOME TIME. WE DON'T HAVE A
SOLID FOUNDATION. THE FOUNDATION LAID BY CHIANG
KAI-SHEK WAS TOO WEAK. BUT THE GREATER PART OF HIS
HERITAGE IS THE LARGE CHINESE POPULATION. NOW WE
HAVE MORE THAN 800 MILLION PEOPLE. HOW MANY DO YOU
HAVE? 200 MILLION?
SLACK: 225 MILLION I THINK.
LI: I THINK YOUR COUNTRY COULD SUPPORT 5-600 MILLION.
ANDREWS: WE HAVE GOT TO GET TO WORK (LAUGHTER).
LI: PERHAPS WE HAVE TOO MANY PEOPLE. WE HAVE BEEN
WORKING TO BRING DOWN THE BIRTH RATE THROUGH FAMILY
PLANNING. IT IS NOT EASY. WE HAVE MADE SOME PROGRESS. IF WE LET IT GO THERE WILL BE AN INCREASE OF
20 MILLION BABIES PER YEAR. NOW THE ANNUAL INCREASE
IS ABOUT 10 MILLION BABIES.
SLACK: DO YOU TAKE A CENSUS LIKE WE DO IN THE US?
LI: STATISTICS ARE TAKEN AT THE GRASS ROOTS LEVEL AND
THEN REFERRED UPWARD. FOR EXAMPLE, A PRODUCTION
BRIGADE REFERS ITS RESULTS TO THE COMMUNE, THEN TO THE

MIGHT NOT BE IN KEEPING WITH ACTUAL CONDITIONS. THEY
REPORT MORE PEOPLE AND GREATER BIRTH RATE; THEN
THEY
ASK THE CENTER TO INVEST MORE MONEY IN THAT AREA.
ROUGHLY SPEAKING THESE FIGURES CONFORM TO REALITY,
HOWEVER. THEY ALSO REPORT LESS REVENUE. FOR 20
YEARS I WAS THE MINISTER OF FINANCE. I STARTED IN
1954 AND IN 1974 I WAS REMOVED (THE CHINESE LAUGH).
NOW I AM NO LONGER MINISTER OF FINANCE. THERE ARE
A LOT OF PROBLEMS AND A LOT OF SQUABBLING BETWEEN THE
MINISTRIES AND THE PROVINCES AND BETWEEN THE DIFFERENT
MINISTRIES. THEY PUT THE BLAME ON ME. I SAID THAT
YOU SHOULD BEAR THE BLAME; I REMAIN A GOOD MAN
(LAUGHTER). SO THERE ARE OTHER PROBLEMS. THE
PEOPLE WANTED MORE AND I GAVE THEM LESS. BUT IN OUR
COUNTRY DECISIONS ARE NOT MADE INDIVIDUALLY BUT
COLLECTIVELY. BOTH CHAIRMAN MAO AND PREMIER CHOU
GAVE ME SUPPORT. THEY SAID I A M A GOOD MAN. THEY
ARE GOOD MEN TOO.
REGARDING SOUTHEAST ASIA, WE HAVE GOOD RELATIONS WITH
ALMOST ALL ASEAN COUNTRIES EXCEPT INDONESIA AND
SINGAPORE. ALTHOUGH THERE ARE NO DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS WITH SINGAPORE WE HAVE GOOD DISCUSSIONS WITH
THEM. NOT LONG AGO VICE PREMIER TENG HSIAO-PING
VISITED SINGAPORE. ALTHOUGH WE HAVE NO DIPLOMATIC
RELATIONS WITH INDONESIA OUR TWO COUNTRIES UNDERSTAND EACH OTHER'S POSITIONS. WE HAVE CONTACTS AND WE
WILL GRADUALLY COME TO AN AGREEMENT ON MANY ISSUES.
THIS IS BECAUSE WE HAVE EXPRESSED SUPPORT FOR THE
ASEAN POLICY OF PEACE, FREEDOM, AND NEUTRALITY. WE
ALSO HAVE FRIENDLY RELATIONS WITH BURMA. OUR RELATIONS WITH VIETNAM ARE NOT GOOD. WE USED TO SUPPORT
THEM. BEFORE 1975 VIETNAM WAS AT WAR. WE SUPPORTED

THEM. OF COURSE, THERE WERE CONTRADICTIONS BUT THEY
WERE NOR BROUGHT TO THE SURFACE. VIETNAM WANTS TO
ESTABLISH AN INDOCHINA FEDERATION. THEY WANT TO
BRING KAMPUCHEA AND LAOS UNDER THEIR CONTROL. THEY
WANT THEM AS THEIR APPENDAGES AND WE EXPRESSED OUR
DISAGREEMENT BY REMAINING SILENT. WE COULDN'T AGREE
TO THEIR REGIONAL HEGEMONY. SO THEY REGARDDED US AS
A BIG OBSTACLE AGAINST THEIR REGIONAL HEGEMONY. DOES

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
VIETNAM ONLY WANT AN INDOCHINA FEDERATION?. I DON'T
BELIEVE THAT. THEY WANT ALSO TO SPREAD IT TO ALL OF
SOUTHEAST ASIA.
WE HAVE GOOD RELATIONS WITH JAPAN. OUR RELATIONS HAVE
ENTERED A VERY GOOD STAGE SINCE WE SIGNED THE PEACE
AND FRIENSHIP TREATY. THE PEACE AND FRIENDSHIP TREATY
IS HISTORICALLY IMPORTANT. THE REACTION IN EUROPE,
SOUTHEAST ASIA AND THE US IS VERY FAVORABLE. THE ONLY
ONE OPPOSED WAS THE SOVIET UNION. OF COURSE THAT ALSO
INCLUDES ITS SATELLITE STATES INCLUDING VIETNAM. THEY
OPPOSED US AND THE SIGNING OF THE PEACE AND FRIENDSHIP TREATY. THIS IS BECAUSE THIS TREATY IS AN
OBSTACLE TO THE SOVIET AMBITIONS TO ESABLISH BLOBAL
HEGEMONY AND THE SOVIET AMBITION TO CREATE AN ASIAN
COLLECTIVE SECURITY SYSTEM.
SO VIETNAM'S AMBITION TO CREATE AN INDOCHINA FEDERATION DOVETAILS WITH THE SOVIET AMBITION TO CREATE
AN ASIAN COLLECTIVE SECURITY SYSTEM. NOW THE
SITUATION IS LIKE THIS. YOU HAVE A CUBA IN YOUR
HEMISPHERE. WE HAVE A CUBA IN OUR HEMISPHERE. YOU
HAVE A CASTRO AND WE HAVE A CASTRO. THEY ARE TWO
DOGS. ONCE I TOLD A FOREIGN FRIEND THAT CASTRO WAS A
RUNNING DOG OF THE SOVIET UNION. NO, HE SAID THAT
CASTRO WAS A WILD DOG. NOW I THINK THAT VIETNAM HAS
BECOME A WILD DOG TOO. THEY WANT TO INVADE KAMPUCHEA.
WE GIVE KAMPUCHEA OUR EXPLICIT SUPPORT. THIS IS
BECAUSE KAMPUCHEA IS A VICTIM OF AGGRESSION AND OPPRESSION. THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS A BOUNDARY CONFLICT.

LI: THE SOVIET UNION HOPES THAT YOUR RELATIONS WITH VIETNAM
WILL BE NORMALIZED. THIS WAY THE SOVIET UNION HOPES THEY
WILL BE ABLE TO GAIN AN ADVANTAGE IN THE POLITICAL AND MILITARY SPHERES. IT IS BECAUSE THE SOVIET UNION CANNOT TAKE
ON THE ECONOMIC BURDEN. THEY WANT YOU AND JAPAN TO TAKE IT
ON. I ADVISE YOU NOT TO TAKE ON THEIR BURDEN. THE BURDEN
IS NOT BIG BUT IT IS DOG DUNG. SOME PEOPLE SAY THAT BY
SUPPLYING AID TO VIETNAM THIS PREVENTS VIETNAM FROM LEANING
TOWARDS THE SOVIET UNION. I TOLD THEM IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE.
WE HAVE SPENT 20 BILLION DOLLARS BUT IT FAILED TO KEEP VIETNAM
AS A FRIEND. IF WE SPEND 1 OR 8 BILLION DOLLARS TO KEEP

NOT AFRAID IF THEY WANT TO COME. LET THEM COME. EVEN IF THEY

WILL NOT NECESSARILY BE MORE THAN PREVIOUSLY. IT MIGHT BE

4 MILLION TONS.

BEEN A SHARP DECREASE IN YIELD. IN OTHER PROVINCES THE YIELD
IS HIGH.

YEMEN AND AFGHANISTAN. I THINK THE SOVIET UNION IS TRYING
TO ENCIRCLE EUROPE. I THINK THEY WILL EVENTUALLY MAKE TROUBLE
IN YOUR OIL SUPPLIES IN THE MIDDLE EAST AND YOUR RAW MATERIAL
SUPPLIES FROM AFRICA, BOTH FOR THE US AND WESTERN EUROPE.
YOU WILL HAVE HAD DISARMAMENT TALKS FOR TEN YEARS. AND THERE
HAS NOT BEEN REAL DISARMAMENT. INSTEAD OF DECREASING ITS
ARMS THE SOVIET UNION IS EXPANDING. WE HOPE YOU WILL MAINTAIN
LTOD RELATIONS WITH EUROPE AND WITH JAPAN. WE MAKE IT VERY
CLEAR TO OUR FRIENDS FROM JAPAN THAT JAPANESE-AMERICAN RELATIONS
COME FIRST, SINO-JAPANESE RELATIONS SECOND. WE WILL NOT DIG
