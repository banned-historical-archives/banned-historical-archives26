		<h3>Tor</h3>
		<p><a href="https://www.torproject.org">Tor</a> is an encrypted anonymising network that makes it harder to intercept internet communications, or see where communications are coming from or going to.</p>
		<p>In order to use the WikiLeaks public submission system as detailed above you can download the Tor Browser Bundle, which is a Firefox-like browser available for Windows, Mac OS X and GNU/Linux and pre-configured to connect using the anonymising system Tor.</p>
		<h4>Tails</h4>
		<p>If you are at high risk and you have the capacity to do so, you can also access the submission system through a secure operating system called <a href="https://tails.boum.org">Tails</a>. Tails is an operating system launched from a USB stick or a DVD that aim to leaves no traces when the computer is shut down after use and automatically routes your internet traffic through Tor. Tails will require you to have either a USB stick or a DVD at least 4GB big and a laptop or desktop computer.</p>

		<h3>Tips</h3>
		<p>Our submission system works hard to preserve your anonymity, but we recommend you also take some of your own precautions. Please review these basic guidelines. </p>
		<div>
			<h4>1. Contact us if you have specific problems</h4>
			<p>If you have a very large submission, or a submission with a complex format, or are a high-risk source, please <a href="#submit_help_contact">contact us</a>. In our experience it is always possible to find a custom solution for even the most seemingly difficult situations.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h4>2. What computer to use</h4>
			<p>If the computer you are uploading from could subsequently be audited in an investigation, consider using a computer that is not easily tied to you. Technical users can also use <a href="https://tails.boum.org">Tails</a> to help ensure you do not leave any records of your submission on the computer.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h4>3. Do not talk about your submission to others</h4>
			<p>If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in source protection – it is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This includes other media organisations.</p>
		</div>

	</div>
</div>

<div id="submit_help_after" class="submit_elem">

			</div>
		</div>

		<h3>After</h3>

		<div>
			<h4>1. Do not talk about your submission to others</h4>
			<p>If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in source protection – it is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This includes other media organisations.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h4>2. Act normal</h4>
			<p>If you are a high-risk source, avoid saying anything or doing anything after submitting which might promote suspicion. In particular, you should try to stick to your normal routine and behaviour.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h4>3. Remove traces of your submission</h4>
			<p>If you are a high-risk source and the computer you prepared your submission on, or uploaded it from, could subsequently be audited in an investigation, we recommend that you format and dispose of the computer hard drive and any other storage media you used.</p>
			<p>In particular, hard drives retain data after formatting which may be visible to a digital forensics team and flash media (USB sticks, memory cards and SSD drives) retain data even after a secure erasure. If you used flash media to store sensitive data, it is important to destroy the media.</p>
			<p>If you do this and are a high-risk source you should make sure there are no traces of the clean-up, since such traces themselves may draw suspicion.</p>
			<div>
				<h4>4. If you face legal action</h4>
				<p>If a legal action is brought against you as a result of your submission, there are organisations that may help you. The Courage Foundation is an international organisation dedicated to the protection of journalistic sources. You can find more details at <a href="https://www.couragefound.org">https://www.couragefound.org</a>.</p>

		<p>WikiLeaks publishes documents of political or historical importance that are censored or otherwise suppressed. We specialise in strategic global publishing and large archives.</p>
		<p>The following is the address of our secure site where you can anonymously upload your documents to WikiLeaks editors. You can only access this submissions system through Tor. (See our <a href="#submit_help_tor">Tor tab</a> for more information.) We also advise you to read our <a href="#submit_help_tips">tips for sources</a> before submitting.</p>

   <p>On Monday February 27th, 2012, WikiLeaks began publishing <i>The Global Intelligence Files</i>, over five million e-mails from the Texas headquartered  "global intelligence" company Stratfor. The e-mails date between July  2004 and late December 2011. They reveal the inner workings of a company  that fronts as an intelligence publisher, but provides confidential  intelligence services to large corporations, such as Bhopal's Dow  Chemical Co., Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, Raytheon and government  agencies, including the US Department of Homeland Security, the US  Marines and the US Defence Intelligence Agency. The emails show  Stratfor's web of informers, pay-off structure, payment laundering techniques and psychological methods.</p>

 Perestroika Lost                                                                   <br />
 By MIKHAIL GORBACHEV                                                               <br />
 Mikhail Gorbachev was the leader of the Soviet Union from 1985 until its collapse  <br />
 in 1991. This article was translated by Pavel Palazhchenko from the Russian.       <br />
 Moscow                                                                             <br />
                                                                                    <br />
 PERESTROIKA, the series of political and economic reforms I undertook in the       <br />
 Soviet Union in 1985, has been the subject of heated debate ever since. Today the  <br />
 controversy has taken on a new urgency A not just because of the 25th              <br />
 anniversary, but also because Russia is again facing the challenge of change. In   <br />
 moments like this, it is appropriate and necessary to look back.                   <br />
                                                                                    <br />
 We introduced perestroika because our people and the country's leaders understood  <br />
 that we could no longer continue as we had. The Soviet system, created on the      <br />
 precepts of socialism amid great efforts and sacrifices, had made our country a    <br />
 major power with a strong industrial base. The Soviet Union was strong in          <br />
 emergencies, but in more normal circumstances, our system condemned us to          <br />
 inferiority.                                                                       <br />
                                                                                    <br />
 This was clear to me and others of the new generation of leaders, as well as to    <br />
 members of the old guard who cared about the country's future. I recall my         <br />
 conversation with Andrei Gromyko, the foreign minister, a few hours before the     <br />
 plenary meeting of the Central Committee that elected me as the party's new        <br />
 general secretary in March 1985. Gromyko agreed that drastic change was needed,    <br />
 however great the risk.                                                            <br />
                                                                                    <br />
 I am often asked whether my fellow leaders of perestroika and I knew the full      <br />
 scope of what we had to do. The answer is yes and no A not fully and not           <br />
 immediately. What we had to abandon was quite clear: the rigid ideological,        <br />
 political and economic system; the confrontation with much of the rest of the      <br />
 world; and the unbridled arms race. In rejecting all that, we had the full         <br />
 support of the people; those officials who later turned out to be die-hard         <br />
 Stalinists had to keep silent and even acquiesce.                                  <br />
                                                                                    <br />
 It ismuch more difficult to answer the follow-up question: What were our goals,    <br />
 what did we want to achieve? We came a long way in a short time A moving from      <br />
 trying to repair the existing system to recognizing the need to replace it. Yet I  <br />
 always adhered to my choice of evolutionary change A moving deliberately so that   <br />
 we would not break the backs of the people and the country and would avoid         <br />
 bloodshed.                                                                         <br />
                                                                                    <br />
 While the radicals pushed us to move faster, the conservatives stepped on our      <br />
 toes. Both groups must bear most of the blame for what happened afterward. I       <br />
 accept my share of responsibility as well. We, the reformers, made mistakes that   <br />
 cost us, and our country, dearly.                                                  <br />
                                                                                    <br />
 Our main mistake was acting too late to reform the Communist Party. The party had  <br />
 initiated perestroika, but it soon became a hindrance to our moving forward. The   <br />
 party's top bureaucracy organized the attempted coup in August 1991, which         <br />
 scuttled the reforms.                                                              <br />
                                                                                    <br />
 We also acted too late in reforming the union of the republics, which had come a   <br />
 long way during their common existence. They had become real states, with their    <br />
 own economies and their own elites. We needed to find a way for them to exist as   <br />
 sovereign states within a decentralized democratic union. In a nationwide          <br />
 referendum of March 1991, more than 70 percent of voters supported the idea of a   <br />
 new union of sovereign republics. But the coup attempt that August, which          <br />
 weakened my position as president, made that prospect impossible. By the end of    <br />
 the year, the Soviet Union no longer existed.                                      <br />
                                                                                    <br />
 We made other mistakes, too. In the heat of political battles we lost sight of     <br />
 the economy, and people never forgave us for the shortages of everyday items and   <br />
 the lines for essential goods.                                                     <br />
                                                                                    <br />
 Still, the achievements of perestroika are undeniable. It was the breakthrough to  <br />
 freedom and democracy. Opinion polls today confirm that even those who criticize   <br />
 perestroika and its leaders appreciate the gains it allowed: the rejection of the  <br />
 totalitarian system; freedom of speech, assembly, religion and movement; and       <br />
 political and economic pluralism.                                                  <br />
                                                                                    <br />
 After the Soviet Union was dismantled, Russian leaders opted for a more radical    <br />
 version of reform. Their &quot;shock therapy&quot; was much worse than the disease. Many     <br />
 people were plunged into poverty; the income gap grew tremendously. Health,        <br />
 education and culture took heavy blows. Russia began to lose its industrial base,  <br />
 its economy becoming fully dependent on exports of oil and natural gas.            <br />
                                                                                    <br />
 By the turn of the century, the country was half destroyed and we were facing      <br />
 chaos. Democracy was imperiled. President Boris Yeltsin's 1996 re-election and     <br />
 the transfer of power to his appointed heir, Vladimir Putin, in 2000 were          <br />
 democratic in form but not in substance. That was when I began to worry about the  <br />
 future of democracy in Russia.                                                     <br />
                                                                                    <br />
 I understood that in a situation where the very existence of the Russian state     <br />
 was at stake, it was not always possible to act &quot;by the book.&quot; Decisive, tough     <br />
 measures and even elements of authoritarianism may be needed at such times. That   <br />
 is why I supported the steps taken by Mr. Putin during his first term as           <br />
 president. I was not alone A 70 percent to 80 percent of the population supported  <br />
 him in those days.                                                                 <br />
                                                                                    <br />
 Nevertheless, stabilizing the country cannot be the only or the final goal.        <br />
 Russia needs development and modernization to become a leader in an                <br />
 interdependent world. Our country has not moved closer to that goal in the past    <br />
 few years, even though for a decade we have benefited from high prices for our     <br />
 main exports, oil and gas. The global crisis has hit Russia harder than many       <br />
 other countries, and we have no one but ourselves to blame.                        <br />
                                                                                    <br />
 Russia will progress with confidence only if it follows a democratic path.         <br />
 Recently, there have been a number of setbacks in this regard.                     <br />
                                                                                    <br />
 For instance, all major decisions are now taken by the executive branch, with the  <br />
 Parliament rubber-stamping formal approval. The independence of the courts has     <br />
 been thrown into question. We do not have a party system that would enable a real  <br />
 majority to win while also taking the minority opinion into account and allowing   <br />
 an active opposition. There is a growing feeling that the government is afraid of  <br />
 civil society and would like to control everything.                                <br />
                                                                                    <br />
 We've been there, done that. Do we want to go back? I don't think anyone does,     <br />
 including our leaders.                                                             <br />
                                                                                    <br />
 I sense alarm in the words of President Dmitri Medvedev when he wondered, &quot;Should  <br />
 a primitive economy based on raw materials and endemic corruption accompany us     <br />
 into the future?&quot; He has also warned against complacency in a society where the    <br />
 government &quot;is the biggest employer, the biggest publisher, the best producer,     <br />
 its own judiciary ... and ultimately a nation unto itself.&quot;                        <br />
                                                                                    <br />
 I agree with the president. I agree with his goal of modernization. But it will    <br />
 not happen if people are sidelined, if they are just pawns. If the people are to   <br />
 feel and act like citizens, there is only one prescription: democracy, including   <br />
 the rule of law and an open and honest dialogue between the government and the     <br />
 people.                                                                            <br />
                                                                                    <br />
 What's holding Russia back is fear. Among both the people and the authorities,     <br />
 there is concern that a new round of modernization might lead to instability and   <br />
 even chaos. In politics, fear is a bad guide; we must overcome it.                 <br />
                                                                                    <br />
 Today, Russia has many free, independently minded people who are ready to assume   <br />
 responsibility and uphold democracy. But a great deal depends now on how the       <br />
 government acts.                                                                   <br />

 5 Reasons Why Russia Isn't China                                                   <br />
 By Yevgeny Bazhanov                                                                <br />
 Yevgeny Bazhanov is vice chancellor of research and international relations at     <br />
 the Foreign Ministry's Diplomatic Academy in Moscow.                               <br />
                                                                                    <br />
 Ever since Mikhail Gorbachev became general secretary 25 years ago last week, the  <br />
 world has compared China's successful economic reforms, which were first set into  <br />
 motion in late 1978 under the leadership of Deng Xiaoping, with the Soviet         <br />
 Union's and then Russia's largely unsuccessful attempts to overhaul its economy.   <br />
 The conventional version is that Moscow somehow took the wrong path toward reform  <br />
 and things would have been a lot better had Russia copied the Chinese model. But   <br />
 this is an oversimplified analysis. The two countries are far too different for    <br />
 Russia to have copied China's reform program in a cookie-cutter fashion.           <br />
                                                                                    <br />
 First, consider the domestic situations in each country. China was embroiled in    <br />
 chaos after the Great Cultural Revolution, which lasted from 1966 to 1976. By      <br />
 1978, the overwhelming majority of Chinese officials and citizens understood the   <br />
 need to institute fundamental reforms. The situation was quite different in the    <br />
 Soviet Union in 1985. Most Soviets viewed the country in 1985 as a superpower      <br />
 with a relatively functioning economy, social stability and order A particularly   <br />
 when compared with the stagnation years under Leonid Brezhnev and in comparison    <br />
 with the widespread poverty and hunger in China before Deng started economic       <br />
 reforms.                                                                           <br />
                                                                                    <br />
 Second, the state apparatus in both countries differed considerably. The           <br />
 authority, power and unity of the Chinese leadership had been severely set back    <br />
 by the Cultural Revolution that the more conservative members could not put up     <br />
 any organized resistance to those who called for fundamental reforms. It was       <br />
 clear to all that something drastic had to be done to revive the country. By       <br />
 contrast, Gorbachev's reforms was heavily resisted by the Politburo's              <br />
 conservative members and among the military top brass.                             <br />
                                                                                    <br />
 Third, two very different individuals headed the reform movements in both          <br />
 countries. China's reforms were led by the highly experienced, former              <br />
 revolutionary figure Deng. He enjoyed enormous authority and had the liberty to    <br />
 take bold steps toward reform. In the Soviet Union, the burden of reform fell on   <br />
 the shoulders of a less experienced, provincial party functionary who was only     <br />
 capable of experimenting within a very limited political and economic framework    <br />
 that was defined by  the old guard.                                                <br />
                                                                                    <br />
 In the end, Deng was able to institute deep and far-reaching reforms, while        <br />
 Gorbachev had to settle for only insignificant economic reforms that were          <br />
 frequently pointless or even detrimental. It is notable that in one of the few     <br />
 cases in which Gorbachev was able to institute a radical economic reform A the     <br />
 introduction of private business cooperatives in 1988, the first time since Lenin  <br />
 that Soviets were given the right to own private businesses A he was forced to     <br />
 retract it a year later.                                                           <br />
                                                                                    <br />
 The fourth factor was the social and economic conditions that prevailed in both    <br />
 countries. China remained an agrarian country. Eighty percent of the people were   <br />
 peasants who hungered for the right to work their own land, and Deng gave them     <br />
 this right. As a result, the situation in the villages quickly improved, and even  <br />
 inveterate skeptics were forced to admit that the reforms were successful. From    <br />
 agriculture, Deng set out to reform to the industrial and other sectors of the     <br />
 economy as well.                                                                   <br />
                                                                                    <br />
 Gorbachev was faced with a completely different situation. Unlike in China, the    <br />
 military-industrial complex was the backbone of the Soviet economy. To stimulate   <br />
 and diversify the economy, it was necessary to make drastic cuts and reforms to    <br />
 the military-industrial manufacturing sector, which permeated virtually all        <br />
 sectors A from producing intercontinental missiles to manufacturing women's        <br />
 shoes. But this was fiercely opposed by the top military brass for obvious         <br />
 reasons, and they had an ideological and military basis for resisting such         <br />
 reforms A that the United States and NATO were a direct threat to the country's    <br />
 national security.                                                                 <br />
                                                                                    <br />
 Further, Gorbachev's attempted agricultural reforms were stifled by 50 years of    <br />
 backwardness in the country's collective farms, fierce opposition from Communist   <br />
 Party apparatchiks to any type of change and A very much in contrast to what       <br />
 happened in China A the lack of desire among Soviet farmers to work harder even    <br />
 under more liberal economic conditions to improve their well-being. On the whole,  <br />
 it was far more difficult to reorganize the more military-based, industrialized    <br />
 Soviet economy than it was China's more agricultural-based, primitive economy.     <br />
                                                                                    <br />
 Fifth, the foreign policies of the two countries differed significantly. China     <br />
 had close military and political ties with the West based on a common opposition   <br />
 to what was perceived as the Kremlin's expansionist foreign policy. As a result,   <br />
 the United States and its allies enthusiastically participated in Chinese reforms  <br />
 both on a governmental and private-sector basis. Chinese nationals living          <br />
 overseas also played a key role in the process.                                    <br />
                                                                                    <br />
 The Soviet Union could not even dream of receiving such assistance from abroad.    <br />
 Gorbachev's first priority was curbing the arms race that had been bleeding the    <br />
 country dry. And that goal could only have been achieved had the conservative      <br />
 elements within the Politburo been willing to downsize and restructure the         <br />
 massive military-industrial complex.                                               <br />
                                                                                    <br />
 After his first two years in office, Gorbachev realized that his economic reform   <br />
 plans had reached a dead end. In 1987, in an attempt to jump-start the process     <br />
 and overcome the conservative resistance, Gorbachev focused on political reforms,  <br />
 hoping to rally the people behind his reforms. But this backfired on him.          <br />
 Democratization and pluralism eroded the very foundation of the Soviet regime and  <br />
 weakened the glue that had been holding the Soviet republics and Russian society   <br />
 together. As a result, the Soviet Union was crippled by an intense struggle        <br />
 between liberals and conservatives within the Politburo, between Moscow and the    <br />
 provinces and among nationalities in the republics. This type of  &quot;shock           <br />
 democratization&quot; has almost always led to chaos in totalitarian regimes.           <br />
                                                                                    <br />
 Thus, the Soviet Union was caught in a vicious circle of political and economic    <br />
 instability. Gorbachev's political reforms led to a debilitating political         <br />
 conflict between liberals and conservatives within the Kremlin, which made it      <br />
 impossible to institute economic reforms. Both of these factors this took the      <br />
 Soviet Union down a slippery slope toward a severe political and economic crisis.  <br />
 Unlike China in 1978, the Kremlin in the mid- and late 1980s could not develop a   <br />
 unified strategy for economic reform A much less to put such a strategy into       <br />
 practice. Ensnared in a deep political deadlock amid deteriorating economic        <br />
 conditions, the Communist regime collapsed in 1991.                                <br />
                                                                                    <br />
 Russia has been struggling to implement its economic reforms ever since, while     <br />
 China is celebrating nearly 32 years of economic success.                          <br />

 Radicalism No Longer Key Trait Of Russian Character - Scholar                      <br />
                                                                                    <br />
 MOSCOW, March 13 (Itar-Tass) -- It looks like the Russian character may loose one  <br />
 of its key traits that has manifested itself so often over centuries - and that    <br />
 trait is radicalism. &quot;One of the most important changes that has occurred in the   <br />
 Russian public mind over the past decade is that over the years of stability such  <br />
 phenomenon as 'radical mentality of the masses' is waning,&quot; says the director of   <br />
 the Sociology Institute at the Russian Academy of Sciences, RAS associate member   <br />
 Mikhail Gorshkov.                                                                  <br />
                                                                                    <br />
 In his opinion, &quot;there have developed new traits of Russian mentality -            <br />
 self-control and consistency of action - neither of these were very                <br />
 characteristic of the masses of the people before.&quot;                                <br />
                                                                                    <br />
 &quot;Triggering a radical nation-wide action of protest today will be impossible -     <br />
 there is no capable political force and, what is still more important, there is    <br />
 no united social base for this - consolidated and internally organized,&quot; Gorshkov  <br />
 told the government-published daily Rossiiskaya Gazeta in an interview.            <br />
                                                                                    <br />
 Sociologists see &quot;no signs of a major surge in protest sentiment .875 one can      <br />
 observe greater irritation, rather than universal discontent.&quot;                     <br />
                                                                                    <br />
 &quot;The crisis has sobered the public mind in a sense,&quot; the scholar believes.&quot; It     <br />
 has prompted the people to not so much believe as to sort things out and           <br />
 understand.&quot;                                                                       <br />
                                                                                    <br />
 &quot;The Russians have proved far wiser and more reserved than many authoritative      <br />
 experts, who - excuse my saying so - literally went hysterical in their forecasts  <br />
 of universal catastrophes and utter chaos in the country as a result of the        <br />
 crisis.&quot;                                                                           <br />
                                                                                    <br />
 &quot;For many years society has retained unique confidence in the powers that be,      <br />
 first and foremost, those at the very top. The transfer of presidential powers     <br />
 from Vladimir Putin to Dmitry Medvedev has not eroded it. And society sees no      <br />
 alternative to them. These two persons are the sole ones whom a majority of        <br />
 society trusts,&quot; Gorshkov said.                                                    <br />
                                                                                    <br />
 He acknowledged that today's youth is the most complicated matter for scientific   <br />
 analysis. The young have been trying to adapt themselves to the world around       <br />
 them, and not just waiting for the world to change the way they want, contrary to  <br />
 what the previous generation preferred to do. They are pragmatics, they lead a     <br />
 very well-calculated lifestyle, they are in no mood of wasting effort and time,    <br />
 but at the same time one in three young people acknowledges that for the sake of   <br />
 attaining one's aims it will be possible to step over morality and the law,        <br />
 Gorshkov warns.                                                                    <br />
                                                                                    <br />
 Also, the scholar claims that the notorious split between generations does not     <br />
 exist in today's Russian society.                                                  <br />
                                                                                    <br />
 &quot;Seventy percent of the young and the old have the same values in life, they       <br />
 pride themselves on the very same facts and the very same persons in Russian       <br />
 history. The victory in World War II, the first man in space and the achievements  <br />
 of our science and culture. For the young, just like for the senior generation,    <br />
 this is not just empty talk or bombastic rhetoric.                                 <br />
                                                                                    <br />
 Sociological surveys indicate that about 70 percent of young people have never     <br />
 participated in any political or public associations and movements and have no     <br />
 intention of ever joining any. The share of the actively-minded ones is about      <br />
 three percent. The remaining 27 percent are passive onlookers. Gorshkov says this  <br />
 is a reserve for the country's large-scale and systematic social and cultural      <br />
 modernization.                                                                     <br />
                                                                                    <br />
 As for the chief obstruction standing in the way of modernization, Gorshkov says   <br />
 it is the Russian bureaucracy, which is still greater than the one of the Soviet   <br />
 era and which has managed to refute Karl Marx himself.                             <br />
                                                                                    <br />
 &quot;Marx used to say one is unable to live in society and to be free from that        <br />
 society at the same time. It has suddenly turned out the other way round.          <br />
 Bureaucracy has placed itself above society, it takes away everything it wants,    <br />
 it runs society the way it pleases, it can act on the presidential decrees, or it  <br />
 can lock them away.                                                                <br />
                                                                                    <br />
 &quot;The ideas of modernization can be shared only by those who are keenly interested  <br />
 in them,&quot; says the scholar. &quot;The very same middle class tiers of society that      <br />
 have in fact been barred from making a rapid headway upwards for a gulp of fresh   <br />
 air. If these people fail to develop confidence in the idea of modernization, if   <br />
 they have no feeling of involvement, then it will remain just the sheet of paper   <br />
 the official program is written on.&quot;                                               <br />

 Media Must Be Critical of Government - Putin                                       <br />
                                                                                    <br />
 DELHI. March 12 (Interfax) - Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has said        <br />
 media's role in society is to act as a check on governments, in which it must act  <br />
 as a &quot;magnifying glass&quot;.                                                           <br />
                                                                                    <br />
 &quot;Generally speaking, mass media's task and philosophy is to criticize, and this    <br />
 is correct,&quot; Putin said in an online conference in Delhi on Friday, when asked to  <br />
 comment on why Russia is portrayed negatively by the Western media.                <br />
                                                                                    <br />
 &quot;The government must feel it is being viewed through a magnifying glass and that   <br />
 it is under public and media attention and control,&quot; he said.                      <br />
                                                                                    <br />
 &quot;Although some portray Russia in negative colors, all of the global companies are  <br />
 actively working in Russia,&quot; the Russian prime minister said.                      <br />
                                                                                    <br />
 &quot;I don't know a single foreign company that would go bankrupt or would be          <br />
 disappointed,&quot; Putin said, noting that &quot;questions and problems do arise.&quot;          <br />
                                                                                    <br />
 &quot;Where there is work, there are problems. Problems do not occur only where no one  <br />
 does anything,&quot; he added.                                                          <br />
                                                                                    <br />
 But the contents of individual negative publications &quot;should be filtered,&quot; he      <br />
 said.                                                                              <br />
                                                                                    <br />
 &quot;Some reports could be written specially to encourage uncivilized competition, or  <br />
 to scare someone, or to create conditions in which individual firms become         <br />
 settled faster. Reasons could vary. But business people confidently make plans,    <br />
 guided not only by what they see and hear through the mass media, but also by      <br />
 business practice and real life,&quot; Putin said.                                      <br />
                                                                                    <br />
 &quot;Even in conditions of a global financial crisis we did not see any of our main    <br />
 partners withdraw from the Russian economy,&quot; he said.                              <br />

 Panic in Georgia After a Mock News Broadcast                                       <br />
 By ANDREW E. KRAMER                                                                <br />
                                                                                    <br />
 MOSCOW A Some people placed emergency calls reporting heart attacks, others        <br />
 rushed in a panic to buy bread and residents of one border village staggered from  <br />
 their homes and dashed for safety A all after a television station in Georgia      <br />
 broadcast a mock newscast on Saturday night that pretended to report on a Russian  <br />
 invasion of the country.                                                           <br />
                                                                                    <br />
 The program was evidently intended as political satire, but the depiction was      <br />
 sufficiently realistic A and memories of the brief war between Russia and Georgia  <br />
 in August 2008 still sufficiently vivid A that viewers headed for the doors        <br />
 before they could absorb the point.                                                <br />
                                                                                    <br />
 Producers at the Imedi television station taped the episode in the studio          <br />
 normally used for the evening news broadcast, using an anchor familiar to the      <br />
 audience, and then broadcast the show at 8 p.m. Saturday with an initial           <br />
 disclaimer that many viewers apparently missed.                                    <br />
                                                                                    <br />
 Looking nervous and fumbling with papers as if juggling the chaos of a breaking    <br />
 news story, the anchor announced that sporadic fighting had begun on the streets   <br />
 of Tbilisi, the capital, that Russian bombers were airborne and heading for        <br />
 Georgia, that troops were skirmishing to the west and that a tank battalion was    <br />
 reported to be on the move.                                                        <br />
                                                                                    <br />
 The broadcast showed tanks rumbling down a road, billowing exhaust, along with     <br />
 jerky images of a fighter jet racing out of the sky and dropping bombs.            <br />
                                                                                    <br />
 &quot;People went into a panic,&quot; Bidzina Baratashvili, a former director of Imedi,      <br />
 said in a telephone interview from Tbilisi. He compared the mock news broadcast    <br />
 and its effect on the population to the radio depiction of an invasion from Mars   <br />
 in Orson Welles's adaptation of &quot;War of the Worlds.&quot;                               <br />
                                                                                    <br />
 Lines formed at gas stations in Georgia and cellphone service crashed under the    <br />
 weight of panicky calls, the authorities said. The frantic buying in the capital   <br />
 made real at least a part of the fake news report, which had described similar     <br />
 scenes unfolding.                                                                  <br />
                                                                                    <br />
 In Tbilisi, where restaurants were packed on Saturday night, rumors swirled of a   <br />
 Russian invasion. Adding to the alarm, when people reached for their cellphones    <br />
 they found that the network had been overloaded.                                   <br />
                                                                                    <br />
 &quot;If you hear that war started, of course you run for the bank machine, then run    <br />
 home, it's natural,&quot; Jumber Jikidze, a taxi driver in Tbilisi, said in a           <br />
 telephone interview, describing the scene as &quot;a little chaos&quot; that lasted for      <br />
 about three hours. The radio station Echo of Moscow reported that residents of     <br />
 Gori, a city that was bombed during the recent war with Russia, left their         <br />
 apartments for the streets as the news anchor read bulletins about the approach    <br />
 of Russian bombers.                                                                <br />
                                                                                    <br />
 Some of the video shown during the show was real file footage with mock            <br />
 voiceovers.                                                                        <br />
                                                                                    <br />
 Opposition leaders called the show a maneuver by Georgia's president, Mikheil      <br />
 Saakashvili, to discredit his political rivals, because the broadcast depicted     <br />
 the opposition as collaborating with the invading Russians. The director of Imedi  <br />
 is a former official in Mr. Saakashvili's government.                              <br />
                                                                                    <br />
 &quot;The government's treatment of its own people is outrageous,&quot; said Nino            <br />
 Burjanadze, an opposition leader whom the mock newscast depicted as greeting the   <br />
 Russians with a smile, according to Agence France-Presse.                          <br />
                                                                                    <br />
 Imedi is a privately owned television station. After the broadcast, a spokeswoman  <br />
 for Mr. Saakashvili, Manana Manjgaladze, condemned the program for frightening     <br />
 viewers.                                                                           <br />
                                                                                    <br />
 On Sunday, Mr. Saakashvili repeated the criticism, but he added that the show had  <br />
 frightened people precisely because it portrayed a realistic future for Georgia    <br />
 if Russia had its way.                                                             <br />
                                                                                    <br />
 &quot;I believe yesterday's report will become an obstacle to them fulfilling their     <br />
 plans, despite the nervous reaction,&quot; he said Sunday, according to the Russian     <br />
 news agency Interfax.                                                              <br />
                                                                                    <br />
 Mr. Saakashvili had previously criticized Ms. Burjanadze for meeting with Prime    <br />
 Minister Vladimir V. Putin in Russia earlier this month. Mr. Saakashvili has no    <br />
 say over what Imedi broadcasts, said Alana Gagloeva, director of the presidential  <br />
 press office.                                                                      <br />
                                                                                    <br />
 The television station clearly identified the program as fictitious before the     <br />
 broadcast began. But viewers who tuned in later would have had to rely on clues.   <br />
 The fighting in the video was taking place in the summer, for example, not in      <br />
 March. The report sketched a scenario in which Russia intervened to quell          <br />
 domestic unrest in Georgia after a disputed election and to support a &quot;people's    <br />
 government&quot; of opposition leaders who had overthrown Mr. Saakashvili. In the       <br />
 show, President Obama was shown striding to a microphone at the White House, with  <br />
 the voiceover explaining that he was announcing sanctions against Russia.          <br />
                                                                                    <br />
 As the extent of the disruption it had caused quickly became clear, Imedi ran a    <br />
 crawl clarifying that the newscast was a simulation and apologizing.               <br />
                                                                                    <br />
 The panic lasted about 15 minutes, said Shota Utiashvili, the director of the      <br />
 department of analysis at the Interior Ministry. Paramedics on Saturday evening    <br />
 reported three times the typical number of emergency calls, many for heart attack  <br />
 symptoms, he said.                                                                 <br />
                                                                                    <br />
 &quot;There was quite a scare,&quot; Mr. Utiashvili said.                                    <br />

 U.S. Ambassador on Imedi TV's Fake Report                                          <br />
 Civil Georgia, Tbilisi / 14 Mar.'10                                                <br />
                                                                                    <br />
 John Bass, the U.S. ambassador to Georgia, said Imedi TV's fake report as if       <br />
 Russian troops started invasion with opposition's help, was &quot;irresponsible&quot; and    <br />
 not helpful to address Georgia's real security threats.                            <br />
                                                                                    <br />
 Speaking at public broadcaster's weekly program, Accents, late on Sunday evening,  <br />
 the ambassador said that the report was &quot;profoundly alarming and disturbing&quot; for   <br />
 people &quot;who did not know whether it was fact or fiction.&quot;                          <br />
                                                                                    <br />
 &quot;That is, to my mind, quite irresponsible,&quot; he said. &quot;It's not in keeping with to  <br />
 what we would consider standards of professional journalism.&quot;                      <br />
                                                                                    <br />
 &quot;And I do not think that type of broadcast, frankly even if it had an indication   <br />
 that it was fiction, is particularly constructive at this point in time to help    <br />
 Georgia address real problems and threats to security it faces,&quot; Ambassador Bass   <br />
 added.                                                                             <br />
                                                                                    <br />
 He was invited at the program to mainly speak about the U.S. Department of         <br />
 State's recent country report on human rights.                                     <br />
                                                                                    <br />
 He said one of the main issues that the report showed in respect of Georgia was    <br />
 that &quot;there is real uneven application, inconsistent application of the rule of    <br />
 law.&quot;                                                                              <br />
                                                                                    <br />
 &quot;I think that is the most important area where Georgia still needs to make a       <br />
 progress,&quot; the ambassador said.                                                    <br />
                                                                                    <br />
 &quot;The biggest challenge Georgia faces right now is completing the transition from   <br />
 its past to a mature democracy in which there are not only the legal framework     <br />
 and institutions of democracy, but there is culture of democracy,&quot; he said.        <br />

 Teen Smoking Called a 'National Catastrophe'                                       <br />
 By Natalya Krainova                                                                <br />
                                                                                    <br />
 Moscow's top doctor said Friday that smoking-related diseases were growing and     <br />
 warned that teenage smoking was leading to a &quot;national catastrophe.&quot;               <br />
                                                                                    <br />
 Dr. Leonid Lazebnik painted a grim picture of the harm that tobacco was causing    <br />
 Russians, telling a round table that 65 percent of men and 30 percent of women     <br />
 have smoked at some time in their lives.                                           <br />
                                                                                    <br />
 In contrast, Lazebnik said, the figures in the mid-1980s were 48 percent of men    <br />
 and 5 percent of women.                                                            <br />
                                                                                    <br />
 He said 24.6 percent of Muscovites are smokers.                                    <br />
                                                                                    <br />
 &quot;But the scariest thing of all is our future,&quot; Lazebnik said. &quot;In Moscow, 73       <br />
 percent of boys and 65 percent of girls smoke. I see this as a national            <br />
 catastrophe.&quot;                                                                      <br />
                                                                                    <br />
 Lazebnik did not provide figures for the growth in smoking-related diseases.       <br />
                                                                                    <br />
 City Hall and federal officials attending Friday's round table promised to lobby   <br />
 for laws that restricted smoking in public places and limited cigarette sales.     <br />
                                                                                    <br />
 &quot;We will have no success without a legal base,&quot; said Yulia Grimalskaya, deputy     <br />
 head of City Hall's department for family and youth policies.                      <br />
                                                                                    <br />
 She said her department was lobbying for a ban on selling cigarettes in kiosks,    <br />
 the licensing of tobacco sales and high fines for smoking in public places,        <br />
 including restaurants.                                                             <br />
                                                                                    <br />
 Nikolai Gerasimenko, first deputy head of State Duma's commission for health       <br />
 protection, called for higher excise duties on tobacco products, which he said     <br />
 would clear the market of contraband cigarettes and drive up cigarette prices,     <br />
 making them less affordable.                                                       <br />
                                                                                    <br />
 Russia has the lowest excise duties on tobacco goods in Europe, said Dmitry        <br />
 Yanin, chairman of the board at the International Confederation of Consumer        <br />
 Societies.                                                                         <br />
                                                                                    <br />
 Yanin urged a ban on tobacco advertising and smoking in public places.             <br />
 &quot;Smoking-free zones would boost Moscow's tourist potential,&quot; Yanin said.           <br />
                                                                                    <br />
 Gerasimenko complained that foreign tobacco makers were making money at Russia's   <br />
 expense.                                                                           <br />
                                                                                    <br />
 &quot;They get their profits, while we spend lots of money on medical treatment,&quot; he    <br />
 said.                                                                              <br />
                                                                                    <br />
 About 10 percent of tobacco traders on the Russian market are foreign, he said.    <br />
                                                                                    <br />
 Lyudmila Stebenkova, head of the Moscow City Duma's commission for public health   <br />
 protection, suggested that restaurants consider offering smoke-free days.          <br />
                                                                                    <br />
 She also said the public needed to be educated about the dangers of smoking        <br />
 through anti-tobacco billboards. Her commission is responsible for creating such   <br />
 billboards, including one that depicts a hand squeezing a dirty sponge, which is   <br />
 compared to a smoker's lung, that was used in a citywide campaign late last year.  <br />
                                                                                    <br />
 According to a survey conducted by the state-run VTsIOM polling agency in          <br />
 December, those billboards, which were posted around the city in November, had     <br />
 led 7 percent of respondents to quit smoking.                                      <br />
                                                                                    <br />
 The survey questioned 1,000 Muscovites, all of them smokers or former smokers, a   <br />
 VTsIOM spokeswoman said by telephone. It offered no margin of error.               <br />

 Putin's party leads Russia poll, some surprises                                    <br />
 By Stuart Williams (AFP)                                                           <br />

 MOSCOW A Russia's dominant ruling party United Russia was leading regional         <br />
 elections but suffered a string of surprising setbacks against the background of   <br />
 the economic crisis, results showed Monday.                                        <br />
                                                                                    <br />
 United Russia -- whose overall leader is Prime Minister Vladimir Putin -- won      <br />
 less than half the vote in some polls for regional parliaments and in a stunning   <br />
 reverse lost the election for mayor in the Siberian city of Irkutsk.               <br />
                                                                                    <br />
 The polls Sunday only involved some of Russia's regions but were being closely     <br />
 watched by the authorities after unusual displays of discontent in recent weeks    <br />
 rattled the Kremlin.                                                               <br />
                                                                                    <br />
 United Russia won over 48 percent of the vote in elections for the local           <br />
 parliament in the Khabarovsk region, a key economic hub in the Far East on the     <br />
 border with China, results published by the central election commission showed.    <br />
                                                                                    <br />
 In the region of Sverdlovsk that includes the Urals economic capital of            <br />
 Yekaterinburg it polled just 40 percent of the vote. However in the sparsely       <br />
 populated Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous Region it won 86 percent.                       <br />
                                                                                    <br />
 The most unsettling news for United Russia was in Irkutsk, a city of over          <br />
 half-a-million people, where its candidate in elections for mayor was thrashed by  <br />
 a candidate supported by the Communist Party.                                      <br />
                                                                                    <br />
 Communist-supported Viktor Kondrashov won over 62 percent of the vote, while       <br />
 United Russia candidate Sergei Serebrennikov could only muster 27 percent,         <br />
 results showed.                                                                    <br />
                                                                                    <br />
 Adding to United Russia's Siberian woes, in the mayoral elections for the nearby   <br />
 city of Ust-Ilimsk the candidate of opposition party A Fair Russia also trounced   <br />
 the United Russia candidate.                                                       <br />
                                                                                    <br />
 The speaker of Russia's lower house of parliament and top United Russia official   <br />
 Boris Gryzlov admitted that these local elections had been tougher than the last   <br />
 set of polls in October due to rises in utility prices.                            <br />
                                                                                    <br />
 &quot;We need losses at a regional level so we recognise the causes of these losses     <br />
 and we correct them,&quot; he said in comments published on the United Russia website.  <br />
                                                                                    <br />
 Another top United Russia leader, Vyacheslav Volodin, emphasised that the results  <br />
 showed Russia were continuing to support the political course of Putin and         <br />
 President Dmitry Medvedev.                                                         <br />
                                                                                    <br />
 In the battles for local parliaments, United Russia's closest challenger was the   <br />
 Communist Party which polled around 20 percent in the key zones. &quot;The electorate   <br />
 has listened to us,&quot; said its leader Gennady Zyuganov.                             <br />
                                                                                    <br />
 Third place went to the nationalist Liberal Democratic Party of veteran firebrand  <br />
 Vladimir Zhirinovsky.                                                              <br />
                                                                                    <br />
 The anti-Kremlin liberal opposition, which has no seats in the national            <br />
 parliament, remained sidelined while turnout in several of the main regions        <br />
 reached little more than 30 percent.                                               <br />
                                                                                    <br />
 Close attention is being paid to developments in Russia's regions after 10,000     <br />
 people attended a protest in the western exclave of Kaliningrad in January, by     <br />
 far the biggest protest since the economic crisis began.                           <br />
                                                                                    <br />
 The organisers had planned to hold a fresh mass protest in Kaliningrad on March    <br />
 20 but called it off at the weekend, saying this was the only way to prevent       <br />
 bloody clashes with police.                                                        <br />
                                                                                    <br />
 Although activists accuse Russia of major democratic shortcomings, the head of     <br />
 the Russian Election Commission Vladimir Churov said after the polls that &quot;the     <br />
 election system in Russia and the electors are the best in the world.&quot;             <br />

                                                                                    <br />

 Regional polls give dose of reality to pro-Kremlin United Russia                   <br />
                                                                                    <br />
 MOSCOW, March 15 (RIA Novosti)-The first results from a round of Russian regional  <br />
 elections seen as a popularity test for United Russia showed the pro-Kremlin       <br />
 party gaining less support that it was expecting.                                  <br />
                                                                                    <br />
 A major blow came in the city of Irkutsk, one of the largest in Siberia, where     <br />
 the Communist candidate for mayor won 62% of the vote, more then double United     <br />
 Russia's candidate, who gained some 27%.                                           <br />
                                                                                    <br />
 Only about half the eligible voters took part in Sunday's polls, which were held   <br />
 in regions from the Far East to European Russia amid rising unemployment and       <br />
 utility charges. Elections to local authorities were held in 76 out of 83 Russian  <br />
 regions.                                                                           <br />
                                                                                    <br />
 Ahead of the elections, United Russia leaders expressed confidence that the party  <br />
 would gain more than 50% in each of the eight elections to regional legislatures,  <br />
 but the predominant power in the federal parliament appears to have fallen short   <br />
 of those expectations.                                                             <br />
                                                                                    <br />
 According to preliminary data, the party was supported by more than a half of      <br />
 those eligible for voting only in four of the eight regions, gaining around 62%    <br />
 in the southwestern Voronezh and about 53% and 50% in the Kaluga and Ryazan        <br />
 regions around Moscow. In the Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous Area in northwest Siberia,  <br />
 where all ballots have been already counted, the party did better with 64% of the  <br />
 vote.                                                                              <br />
                                                                                    <br />
 In the Khabarovsk Territory in the Far East, the Altai Republic and Kurgan Region  <br />
 in southern Siberia, and in the Sverdlovsk Region in the Urals, the party managed  <br />
 only about 48%, 44%, 41% and 40%, respectively.                                    <br />
                                                                                    <br />
 United Russia is, however, leading in each of the regional legislative polls,      <br />
 followed by the Communists, Liberal Democrats (LDPR) and the A Just Russia party,  <br />
 which exchanged second, third and fourth places in different regions.              <br />
                                                                                    <br />
 Leading Russian business daily Kommersant quoted on Monday a source in United      <br />
 Russia's leadership as saying preliminary results &quot;look like a wave of protest     <br />
 voting,&quot; with people supporting anyone but the ruling &quot;power.&quot;                     <br />
                                                                                    <br />
 Political scientist Boris Makarenko told the paper the first results demonstrated  <br />
 a trend towards an increasing opposition presence in Russia's local legislatures.  <br />
                                                                                    <br />
 A spokesman for the country's Central Election Commission said all four parties    <br />
 represented in the lower house of the Russian parliament - United Russia, the      <br />
 Communists, Liberal Democrats (LDPR) and the opposition A Just Russia party -      <br />
 would make it into the eight regions' legislations.                                <br />
                                                                                    <br />
 Central Election Commission head Vladimir Churov said on Monday the average        <br />
 voters' turnout in the Russian legislative polls was 42.6%.                        <br />

 Four Russian parties make it to regional parliaments                               <br />
                                                                                    <br />
 According to preliminary results, all four political parties represented in        <br />
 Russia's State Duma managed to win seats in regional parliaments as a result of    <br />
 Sunday's local polls.                                                              <br />
                                                                                    <br />
 Those include ruling United Russia party, chaired by Prime Minister Vladimir       <br />
 Putin, the Communists, Liberal-Democrats (LDPR) and Fair Russia. Eight regions     <br />
 held parliamentary elections on March 14.                                          <br />
                                                                                    <br />
 Voters in 76 of the country's 83 regions cast their ballots on Unified Election    <br />
 Day, choosing authorities at different levels. About 32 million people went to     <br />
 the polls to elect deputies to the local legislative authorities, local            <br />
 government and heads of local administrations. Overall, candidates competed for    <br />
 about 40,000 seats in different regional state bodies.                             <br />
                                                                                    <br />
 Despite the United Russia party traditionally winning a string of seats, the       <br />
 Communist party also made a strong showing. Support for United Russia has slipped  <br />
 in several areas A most prominently Irkutsk, one of Siberia's largest cities,      <br />
 where a Communist candidate has been elected Mayor. Both leading parties have      <br />
 called the results a success.                                                      <br />
                                                                                    <br />
 A Fair Russia candidate won the mayoral seat in the city of Ust-Ilimsk in Irkutsk  <br />
 region.                                                                            <br />
                                                                                    <br />
 According to Russia's Central Election Commission, the voting passed peacefully,   <br />
 with a turnout of over 42 per cent and no allegations of ballot fraud.             <br />
                                                                                    <br />
 Everybody seems to be quite content with the outcome of this election, assessed    <br />
 Olga Kamenchuk, communications director for the Russian Public Opinion Research    <br />
 Centre.                                                                            <br />
                                                                                    <br />
 &quot;Now we will have wide representation of opposition parties in regional            <br />
 parliaments, but still only those which have representation in the State Duma,&quot;    <br />
 she said.                                                                          <br />
                                                                                    <br />
 Still there is no consistent trend of passing power to opposition parties, and     <br />
 United Russia remains a no-alternative choice for many voters, a fifth of whom     <br />
 had no intention of voting at all, according to social research prior to the       <br />
 elections.                                                                         <br />
                                                                                    <br />
 Claims over fraud in previous 2009 elections                                       <br />
                                                                                    <br />
 The allegations of fraud during the previous, October 2009 regional elections,     <br />
 led to a brief parliamentary crisis. After the elections, in which the ruling      <br />
 United Russia claimed an overwhelming victory, all three opposition parties (the   <br />
 Communists, the Liberal Democrats and Fair Russia) walked out of Russia's lower    <br />
 house of parliament, the State Duma, protesting over the election results and      <br />
 demanding an urgent meeting with the President. They claimed widespread voting     <br />
 irregularities and insisted on fresh elections in Moscow, the Tula region and the  <br />
 Marij El republic. Subsequent checks, however, revealed no serious violations.     <br />
 Neither have there been any major court proceedings.                               <br />
                                                                                    <br />
 Improving Russia's political system                                                <br />
                                                                                    <br />
 Following this political scandal, President Dmitry Medvedev in his November 2009   <br />
 address to the Federal Assembly, acknowledged some problems in the organization    <br />
 of elections: &quot;Some aspects of our political life are subject to public            <br />
 criticism. The critics note problems in organizing the elections, the low level    <br />
 of political culture and the deficit of deeply-elaborated alternative suggestions  <br />
 on particular questions of socio-economic development.&quot; He noted that special      <br />
 attention will be drawn to the problems of regional elections.                     <br />
                                                                                    <br />
 The president also signaled that it is necessary to &quot;give way&quot; to all political    <br />
 parties, including opposition parties. In an address to the State Council,         <br />
 Medvedev proposed a draft law that would lower the threshold at regional           <br />
 elections from the current 7 per cent to 5 per cent, to allow more parties be      <br />
 represented at regional parliaments. The President also noted that there are some  <br />
 local parliaments in which only one party is represented. &quot;One political faction,  <br />
 I believe, is not enough for any region,&quot; Medvedev stated. &quot;There are people who   <br />
 have different opinions who vote for other parties. Perhaps, even two [parties]    <br />
 would not be enough.&quot;                                                              <br />
                                                                                    <br />
 As Nezavisimaja Gazeta writes, citing an unnamed source in the government, the     <br />
 Kremlin wanted to put a law in place which suggests that at least four parties     <br />
 should be represented in the local parliaments. According to the source, Russia's  <br />
 leadership was eager to put this law in place before these elections, and by       <br />
 doing so, the authorities were trying to avoid the situation which happened        <br />
 during the last elections in October 2009. Back then, only two parties (United     <br />
 Russia and Communists) made it to the Moscow Duma.                                 <br />
                                                                                    <br />
 Opposition still not satisfied                                                     <br />
                                                                                    <br />
 Nevertheless, despite several calls from the President for more parties to be      <br />
 represented in local parliaments, it seems the ruling United Russia party does     <br />
 not want to give up its positions easily. As Novie Izvestiya writes, this          <br />
 election campaign has been even more aggressive than the previous one, and the     <br />
 United Russia party is trying to fight its declining popularity in some of the     <br />
 regions. However, Duma Deputy and Communist party member, Vadim Solovjev, in an    <br />
 interview to the daily, assesses the overall situation ahead of the elections as   <br />
 &quot;favorable&quot;, noting that people have become more leftist as a result of the        <br />
 financial crisis, and many do not want to vote for the ruling party. The deputy    <br />
 says that the United Russia ratings are falling and as a result it is trying to    <br />
 improve the situation by using its &quot;administrative&quot; resources.                     <br />
                                                                                    <br />
 Concerns over the elections' transparency                                          <br />
                                                                                    <br />
 Concerns over the fairness of the elections were raised even before the voting     <br />
 started. As Kommersant daily reported, opposition parties in the cities of         <br />
 Yekaterinburg and Astrakhan claimed that people working in state companies were    <br />
 forced to vote in early elections and by absentee ballots. According to the        <br />
 newspaper, which further quoted its sources in the Sverdlovsk electoral            <br />
 commission, the number of issued absentee ballots this time exceeded the number    <br />
 of those ballots given during the presidential campaign in 2008 by almost seven    <br />
 times. Duma Deputy Sergey Obukhov said this was a &quot;mere reflection of the          <br />
 administrative resource, which gives 10 per cent of the vote to the ruling         <br />
 party.&quot;                                                                            <br />
                                                                                    <br />
 In Astrakhan, less than 10 days before the official start of early elections,      <br />
 6,800 people already came to vote and, the opposition's monitors said, most of     <br />
 them were municipal body employees. &quot;The mayor's office decided to fabricate the   <br />
 elections by conducting them in advance,&quot; said the leader of the local Fair        <br />
 Russia party branch, Oleg Shein. However, a source in the United Russia party      <br />
 told Kommersant that the mass &quot;early elections&quot; had been practically stopped       <br />
 everywhere by a call from the President's administration on March 5.               <br />
                                                                                    <br />
 Changes to improve voting system and elections' transparency                       <br />
                                                                                    <br />
 A special commission was set up by the Russian President to improve the current    <br />
 election laws. On the 24th of November 2009, Dmitry Medvedev also vowed to make    <br />
 the procedure of acquiring absentee ballots stricter. According to the draft law,  <br />
 it will be much more difficult to obtain and to fabricate an absentee ballot. A    <br />
 person who wishes to get one, in addition to a written request to acquire the      <br />
 ballot, will have to present a document confirming that he cannot attend the       <br />
 election on the due date (i.e. a document proving that he is on a business trip    <br />
 or in hospital). Also the new absentee ballot will have a much higher level of     <br />
 protection and will be personalized.                                               <br />
                                                                                    <br />
 Also the role of the law-enforcement agencies will be increased. All incidents     <br />
 will be registered by a maximum number of witnesses in order to make sure that     <br />
 the person who violated the law will be held responsible. The head of the Central  <br />
 Election Committee, Vladimir Churov, said a person who casts a vote will also be   <br />
 able to personally check that his or her vote was counted; however, Churov has     <br />
 not specified how exactly this will be achieved.                                   <br />
                                                                                    <br />
 Some of the changes will already be implemented in the current elections. Thus,    <br />
 the electoral commissions are encouraged to work with people, who due to various   <br />
 reasons have not yet acquired or have lost their registration (according to        <br />
 Russian law, in order to be able to appear on a voting list, a person needs to be  <br />
 registered at the address, where he or she currently lives).                       <br />
                                                                                    <br />
 The Central Election Committee is also going to try out a system of electronic     <br />
 voting in several electoral stations. If successful, Churov noted, the technology  <br />
 will be implemented more widely. &quot;Well, the way we envisage this is that a person  <br />
 would come to a polling station, show their passport and vote by either scanning   <br />
 the paper ballot or by filling in an electronic one on the screen. Then at 8pm,    <br />
 when the polling station is closed, these electronic machines, practically         <br />
 without human interference, will post the results on the Internet&quot;. Also, as part  <br />
 of the experiment, some of the ballot stations will have web cameras to ensure     <br />
 more transparent and fair elections.                                               <br />
                                                                                    <br />
 The Unified Election Day has been held in Russia twice a year, in October and      <br />
 March, since 2006. The day has been designed to reduce the number of multiple      <br />
 elections on different levels during the year by combining them all on only two    <br />
 days.                                                                              <br />

 Regional Elections Give Russia's Ruling Party Food For Thought                     <br />
                                                                                    <br />
 (RFE/RL) -- Heavily managed regional and local elections in 76 of Russia's 83      <br />
 federation subjects have given the vast majority of mandates to the ruling United  <br />
 Russia party, according to preliminary results. However, support for the party in  <br />
 percentage terms declined compared to similar polls last October, with the party   <br />
 polling over 50 percent in just four of the eight regions electing regional        <br />
 legislatures.                                                                      <br />
                                                                                    <br />
 State Duma speaker Boris Gryzlov, the executive director of United Russia,         <br />
 hurried today to put a brave face on the results.                                  <br />
                                                                                    <br />
 &quot;The number of the mandates that United Russia got against the total number of     <br />
 the mandates in this election is 68 percent. This result is much better than it    <br />
 was in October or March last year,&quot; he said.                                       <br />
                                                                                    <br />
 In October, the ruling party, headed by Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, polled      <br />
 more than 50 percent in all the regions that were conducting regionwide voting,    <br />
 while this time around, it managed to do so in only four of eight regions. The     <br />
 results were particularly low in Sverdlovsk Oblast (42 percent) and the Republic   <br />
 of Altai (43 percent).                                                             <br />
                                                                                    <br />
 In addition, the party lost two significant mayoral elections.                     <br />
                                                                                    <br />
 In the Far Eastern city of Irkutsk, the Communist-supported candidate, Viktor      <br />
 Kondrashov, trounced his United Russia opponent, Deputy Mayor Sergei               <br />
 Serebrennikov, polling 62 percent compared to 27.                                  <br />
                                                                                    <br />
 In Ust-Ilimsk, also in Irkutsk Oblast, A Just Russia candidate Vladimir Tashkin    <br />
 polled more than 72 percent, compared to just 20 percent for his United Russia     <br />
 rival, Irina Bondarenko.                                                           <br />
                                                                                    <br />
 Criticized By Medvedev                                                             <br />
                                                                                    <br />
 In all eight regions that elected new legislatures, all four of the parties with   <br />
 seats in the State Duma will be represented. This development comes after          <br />
 President Dmitry Medvedev criticized the October regional elections, which left    <br />
 some legislatures with as few as two factions. As a result, the semiofficial       <br />
 opposition parties -- the Communist Party, the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia  <br />
 (LDPR), and A Just Russia -- which publicly protested against the results in       <br />
 October generally expressed satisfaction with the latest round of elections.       <br />
 Overall, the Communists made the second-strongest showing, polling about 20        <br />
 percent in most regions, while the LDPR and A Just Russia were neck-and-neck in    <br />
 most races with results hovering around 15 percent.                                <br />
                                                                                    <br />
 The elections were held against a background of rising protests, primarily over    <br />
 economic issues such as increases in housing, utilities, and transportation        <br />
 costs. The business daily &quot;Kommersant&quot; quoted an unidentified United Russia        <br />
 official as saying the results &quot;look like a wave of protest voting.&quot;               <br />
                                                                                    <br />
 United Russia announced plans to hold its own demonstrations in Moscow and other   <br />
 cities today, ostensibly to inform voters of their successes at the polls and to   <br />
 discuss shortcomings in its performance.                                           <br />
                                                                                    <br />
 Nonetheless, United Russia's grip on political power across the country and at     <br />
 all levels continues to tighten. The party's election campaign was widely          <br />
 criticized by independent observers for being particularly aggressive. It          <br />
 appealed to local election commissions in numerous cases to disqualify candidates  <br />
 on multiple pretexts. It also benefited from earlier changes in election laws      <br />
 that gave it advantages in the distribution of mandates.                           <br />
                                                                                    <br />
 Widespread Irregularities                                                          <br />
                                                                                    <br />
 Lilya Shibanova, executive director of the independent Golos election-monitoring   <br />
 organization, complained of widespread irregularities in many elections,           <br />
 including in municipal voting in Yekaterinburg.                                    <br />
                                                                                    <br />
 &quot;There were massive violations in Yekaterinburg, including busing voters in to     <br />
 vote en masse. Buses were used in great quantities; polling stations were opened   <br />
 in shopping areas where sales were held as voting was going on, including the      <br />
 handing out of gifts,&quot; Shibanova says. &quot;This was all done actively. In             <br />
 Yekaterinburg, there was a very high percentage of voting by absentee ballot.&quot;     <br />
                                                                                    <br />
 Shibanova noted that as the number of political parties declines -- the liberal    <br />
 Yabloko party, for example, was disqualified from competing in Sverdlovsk Oblast   <br />
 and Kaluga Oblast -- the number of election monitors is also on the wane.          <br />
                                                                                    <br />
 &quot;While earlier at local elections there were as many as 10 to 12 observers,&quot; she   <br />
 says, &quot;we now consider it good when there are at least three monitors. Overall,    <br />
 the level of public monitoring is declining as political competition declines.&quot;    <br />
                                                                                    <br />
 Overall turnout in the March 14 poll was 42.6 percent. It was the last major       <br />
 election event in Russia before the next cycle of national elections begins, with  <br />
 voting for the State Duma in December 2011 and a presidential election to be held  <br />
 in March 2012.                                                                     <br />

 Russian opposition 'satisfied' with regional election results                      <br />
                                                                                    <br />
 MOSCOW, March 15 (RIA Novosti) - Russian opposition parties expressed              <br />
 satisfaction with the results of Sunday's regional legislative elections as seen   <br />
 a popularity test for the pro-Kremlin United Russia party.                         <br />
 Elections to local authorities were held on Sunday in 76 out of 83 regions from    <br />
 the Far East to European Russia amid rising unemployment and utility charges.      <br />
                                                                                    <br />
 Preliminary results of the polls showed United Russia leading in each of the       <br />
 eight regional legislative polls. However, the predominant force in the federal    <br />
 parliament appeared to gain less support in the polls than it was expecting.       <br />
                                                                                    <br />
 A major blow came in the city of Irkutsk, one of the largest in Siberia, where     <br />
 the Communist candidate for mayor won 62% of the vote, more then double United     <br />
 Russia's candidate, who gained some 27%.                                           <br />
                                                                                    <br />
 The results of the legislative polls ran counter to United Russia leaders'         <br />
 expectations, with the party gaining support of over half of those casting votes   <br />
 in only four of the eight regions.                                                 <br />
                                                                                    <br />
 All four parties represented in the lower house of the Russian parliament -        <br />
 United Russia, the Communists, Liberal Democrats (LDPR) and the A Just Russia      <br />
 party - made it into the eight regional legislatures.                              <br />
                                                                                    <br />
 The Russian opposition appears more satisfied with the results of Sunday's         <br />
 elections than with those of the October 2009 regional polls. Opposition factions  <br />
 then walked out of parliament in protest against fraud during the polls, which     <br />
 were won in a landslide by United Russia.                                          <br />
                                                                                    <br />
 Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov said on Monday the polls indicated that          <br />
 Russians' minds were becoming more left-wing, and their sentiments more &quot;red.&quot;     <br />
                                                                                    <br />
 Zyuganov said the number of Communists' supporters increased &quot;significantly.&quot; &quot;We  <br />
 move forward,&quot; he said.                                                            <br />
                                                                                    <br />
 The Liberal Democrats were also optimistic about the elections results.            <br />
                                                                                    <br />
 &quot;The process of democratization of elections in our country has activated, and we  <br />
 are very pleased with this fact,&quot; LDPR parliamentary faction leader Igor Lebedev   <br />
 told RIA Novosti, adding that the results of Sunday's polls were &quot;absolutely       <br />
 different&quot; if compared with those of the previous regional polls.                  <br />
                                                                                    <br />
 He said the elections were &quot;positive&quot; for LDPR.                                    <br />
                                                                                    <br />
 The A Just Russia party was also &quot;satisfied&quot; with the results. The leader of the   <br />
 party's parliamentary faction, Nikolai Levichev, said the support of the party     <br />
 increased by 75% if compared with the October 2009 elections.                      <br />
                                                                                    <br />
 He said the elections showed the party made a &quot;step forward.&quot;                      <br />

 A Country Without Icons                                                            <br />
 By Richard Lourie                                                                  <br />
 Richard Lourie is author of &quot;The Autobiography of Joseph Stalin&quot; and &quot;Sakharov: A  <br />
 Biography.&quot;                                                                        <br />
                                                                                    <br />
 In the past, Russia always had a strong sense of identity, often centered around   <br />
 images. When Vladimir I of Kiev baptized Kievan Rus in 988, the pagan idols were   <br />
 whipped, burned and hurled into the river. The Bolsheviks were iconoclasts too,    <br />
 turning churches into warehouses and using icons for flooring in banyas.           <br />
                                                                                    <br />
 But the end of Soviet Russia was different from the end of pagan or tsarist        <br />
 Russia. True, in the initial exuberance, statues of Lenin, Stalin and others were  <br />
 smashed or hurled to the ground. But unlike the Christians and the Bolsheviks, no  <br />
 one was waiting in the wings with a ready-made ideology or new icons.              <br />
                                                                                    <br />
 The Russian national idea, a somewhat vague and clumsy formulation, indicates a    <br />
 vision of goals and a system of values embraced by the state and the people to     <br />
 create the country's identity at a given historical moment. Typically, it          <br />
 stresses the uniquely Russian elements in its opposition to the West. That         <br />
 identity has failed to crystallize in the new Russia in the nearly 20 years since  <br />
 the collapse of the Soviet Union.                                                  <br />
                                                                                    <br />
 That vacuum has been described in both positive and negative terms. Fyodor         <br />
 Lukyanov, editor of Russia In Global Affairs, says in contrast to former U.S.      <br />
 President George W. Bush and &quot;the missionaries on the other side of the Atlantic   <br />
 ... Russian policy can be criticized for many things, but it has managed so far    <br />
 to avoid the inclination toward ideology.&quot; Opposition leader Gary Kasparov sees    <br />
 it in darker tones: &quot;The Cold War was based on ideas A like them or not. [Prime    <br />
 Minister Vladimir] Putin's only idea can be concentrated into the motto 'Let's     <br />
 steal together.'&quot; Yabloko leader Grigory Yavlinsky terms the new Russia as         <br />
 &quot;capitalism with a Stalinist face.&quot;                                                <br />
                                                                                    <br />
 Describing the present is only the beginning. The next and more difficult steps    <br />
 are pointing out a new vision for Russia and indicating the practical path that    <br />
 leads to it. In &quot;Putin: The Results,&quot; opposition leader Boris Nemtsov wrote:       <br />
 &quot;Russia needs at last to become what it has a right to be: a successful European   <br />
 country in which its people have decent lives. ... We need a government that       <br />
 doesn't rule the people but serves them.&quot; But he has no idea of how to go about    <br />
 it: &quot;First and foremost, the police state has to be dismantled and human dignity   <br />
 returned to the people.&quot; But how are such states dismantled and who returns the    <br />
 dignity?                                                                           <br />
                                                                                    <br />
 The intelligentsia has largely abdicated its traditional role as opposition and    <br />
 creator of values. President Dmitry Medvedev called their objections &quot;very often   <br />
 emotional, scathing, but superficial and irresponsible.&quot;                           <br />
                                                                                    <br />
 Indeed, it has been Medvedev who has done the most to forge a new vision of what   <br />
 the new Russia should and could look like. His September &quot;Go, Russia!&quot; manifesto   <br />
 was honest and realistic. He called for a diversified, innovative economy based    <br />
 on the &quot;intellectual resources of post-industrial societies.&quot; Moreover, he wrote,  <br />
 &quot;The more intelligent, smarter and efficient our economy is, the higher the level  <br />
 of our citizen's welfare, and our political system and society as a whole will     <br />
 also be freer, fairer and more humane.&quot;                                            <br />
                                                                                    <br />
 Medvedev will probably recede into the background when Putin is re-elected         <br />
 president in 2012. In the meantime, he should keep hammering away at his vision    <br />
 of what the new Russia can be A that is, Russia's great task and challenge at      <br />
 this point in history. Medvedev's presidency will be more than justified if he     <br />
 helps fashion the new icon of identity that will guide his nation into the         <br />
 future.                                                                            <br />
