		<h3>Tor</h3>
		<p><a href="https://www.torproject.org">Tor</a> is an encrypted anonymising network that makes it harder to intercept internet communications, or see where communications are coming from or going to.</p>
		<p>In order to use the WikiLeaks public submission system as detailed above you can download the Tor Browser Bundle, which is a Firefox-like browser available for Windows, Mac OS X and GNU/Linux and pre-configured to connect using the anonymising system Tor.</p>
		<h4>Tails</h4>
		<p>If you are at high risk and you have the capacity to do so, you can also access the submission system through a secure operating system called <a href="https://tails.boum.org">Tails</a>. Tails is an operating system launched from a USB stick or a DVD that aim to leaves no traces when the computer is shut down after use and automatically routes your internet traffic through Tor. Tails will require you to have either a USB stick or a DVD at least 4GB big and a laptop or desktop computer.</p>

		<h3>Tips</h3>
		<p>Our submission system works hard to preserve your anonymity, but we recommend you also take some of your own precautions. Please review these basic guidelines. </p>
		<div>
			<h4>1. Contact us if you have specific problems</h4>
			<p>If you have a very large submission, or a submission with a complex format, or are a high-risk source, please <a href="#submit_help_contact">contact us</a>. In our experience it is always possible to find a custom solution for even the most seemingly difficult situations.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h4>2. What computer to use</h4>
			<p>If the computer you are uploading from could subsequently be audited in an investigation, consider using a computer that is not easily tied to you. Technical users can also use <a href="https://tails.boum.org">Tails</a> to help ensure you do not leave any records of your submission on the computer.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h4>3. Do not talk about your submission to others</h4>
			<p>If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in source protection – it is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This includes other media organisations.</p>
		</div>

	</div>
</div>

<div id="submit_help_after" class="submit_elem">

			</div>
		</div>

		<h3>After</h3>

		<div>
			<h4>1. Do not talk about your submission to others</h4>
			<p>If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in source protection – it is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This includes other media organisations.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h4>2. Act normal</h4>
			<p>If you are a high-risk source, avoid saying anything or doing anything after submitting which might promote suspicion. In particular, you should try to stick to your normal routine and behaviour.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h4>3. Remove traces of your submission</h4>
			<p>If you are a high-risk source and the computer you prepared your submission on, or uploaded it from, could subsequently be audited in an investigation, we recommend that you format and dispose of the computer hard drive and any other storage media you used.</p>
			<p>In particular, hard drives retain data after formatting which may be visible to a digital forensics team and flash media (USB sticks, memory cards and SSD drives) retain data even after a secure erasure. If you used flash media to store sensitive data, it is important to destroy the media.</p>
			<p>If you do this and are a high-risk source you should make sure there are no traces of the clean-up, since such traces themselves may draw suspicion.</p>
			<div>
				<h4>4. If you face legal action</h4>
				<p>If a legal action is brought against you as a result of your submission, there are organisations that may help you. The Courage Foundation is an international organisation dedicated to the protection of journalistic sources. You can find more details at <a href="https://www.couragefound.org">https://www.couragefound.org</a>.</p>

		<p>WikiLeaks publishes documents of political or historical importance that are censored or otherwise suppressed. We specialise in strategic global publishing and large archives.</p>
		<p>The following is the address of our secure site where you can anonymously upload your documents to WikiLeaks editors. You can only access this submissions system through Tor. (See our <a href="#submit_help_tor">Tor tab</a> for more information.) We also advise you to read our <a href="#submit_help_tips">tips for sources</a> before submitting.</p>

    Re: ANALYSIS FOR COMMENT - CHINA - 5th Generation Leadership<br />
<br />
<br />
   Really thorough research.<br />
<br />
   I think there are portions that could be cut -- they either overstate<br />
   points we have said countless times or are just straight up repetitions<br />
   (especially in the regionalism area) so that we can emphasize a little<br />
   more the &quot;generational effects&quot;, which I think our readers will enjoy the<br />
   most. Also this is important, something we need to look for in other<br />
   regions always. So I would really focus in on those points in every<br />
   section, to tie the piece a little more around a general theme.<br />
<br />
   You may even consider actually expanding the piece a little by explaining<br />
   &quot;generational effects&quot;, how they operate in general -- what are the causal<br />
   mechanics by which they influence policy makers -- and what the unifying<br />
   characteristics of the 5th generation are. Do that right at the top,<br />
   before you go into civilian leadership. Wouldn't have to be a long<br />
   section, 3-4 paragraphs max. And if you cut the repetitions in other<br />
   places, the piece would stay relatively the same, if not still shorter.<br />
   That way it is clear that this research has a unifying focus and that we<br />
   feel that the switch in generations is the most notable issue.<br />
<br />
   One reason why I really think emphasizing this concept in the abstract at<br />
   the top would be useful is because it reconciles Stratfor's relatively<br />
   marginalizing view of leaders with the fact that political geography --<br />
   and its evolution -- does influence leaders through these &quot;generational<br />
   effects&quot;. This is essentially a way in which geopolitics influences<br />
   leaders, by teaching them and impressing on them generational &quot;lessons&quot; in<br />
   their formative years. It also allows us to talk of individuals in a<br />
   geopolitically informed way.<br />

   In 2012, China's Communist Party (CCP) leaders will retire and a new<br />
   generation -- the Fifth Generation -- will take the helm. The transition<br />
   will affect the CCP's most powerful decision-making organs, determining<br />
   the make up of the 18th CCP Central Committee, the Political Bureau<br />
   (Politburo) of the Central Committee, and, most importantly, the<br />
   nine-member Standing Committee of the Politburo (SCP) that is the core of<br />
   political power in China.<br />
<br />
   While there is considerable uncertainty over the hand off, given China's<br />
   lack of clearly established procedures for the succession and the immense<br />
   challenges facing the regime, nevertheless there is little reason to<br />
   anticipate a full-blown succession crisis. However, the sweeping personnel<br />
   change comes at a critical juncture in China's modern history, in which<br />
   the economic model that has enabled decades of rapid growth has clearly<br />
   don't need clearly, its strong enough (maybe stronger) without it become<br />
   unsustainable, social unrest is rising, and international resistance to<br />
   China's policies is increasing. At the same time, the characteristics of<br />
   the fifth generation leaders suggest a cautious and balanced civilian<br />
   leadership paired with an increasingly influential military.<br />
<br />
   Therefore the Chinese leadership that emerges from 2012 will likely be<br />
   incapable of decisively pursuing deep structural reforms, obsessively<br />
   focused on maintaining internal stability, and more aggressive in pursuing<br />
   the core strategic interests it sees as essential to this stability.<br />
<br />
   PART ONE -- CIVILIAN LEADERSHIP<br />
   Power transitions in the People's Republic of China have always been<br />
   fraught with uncertainties, which arise because China does not have clear<br />
   and fixed procedures for the transfer of power from old to young leaders.<br />
   The state's founding leader, Mao Zedong, did not establish a formal<br />
   process before he died, giving rise to a power struggle in his wake<br />
   between the ultra-left &quot;Gang of Four&quot; and its opponents, the more<br />
   pragmatic leaders in the party who emerged victorious with Deng Xiaoping's<br />
   coup in 1978?. Deng, like Mao, was a strong leader from a military<br />
   background -- the thing with this reference to &quot;military background&quot;...<br />
   it's something that has been on my mind since your discussions. Can we<br />
   really say that Mao and Deng have military backgrounds? Ok, they were<br />
   guerillas against the Japanese, but they weren't professionals.... The new<br />
   generation are military professionals. The two are different in a lot of<br />
   ways. I am not sure that you can equate their military experience with the<br />
   military experience of a 5th gen leader who grew up in China's<br />
   professional military. I am not even sure why you need to do it. whose<br />
   personal power could override rules and institutions. Deng's retirement<br />
   also failed to set a firm precedent -- he saw two of his chosen successors<br />
   fall from grace, and then maintained extensive influence well after his<br />
   formal retirement.<br />
<br />
   Nevertheless, Deng set in motion a pattern that enabled the 2002<br />
   transition from President Jiang Zemin to Hu Jintao to go smoothly, though<br />
   there were factional tensions behind the scenes that were potentially<br />
   disruptive. Deng had appointed Hu to be Jiang's successor, lending some of<br />
   his great authority to Hu and thus conferring a degree of inevitability to<br />
   the transition, deterring potential power grabs. This pattern was<br />
   reinforced when Jiang put Vice-President Xi Jinping in place to succeed Hu<br />
   in 2012. Thus the coming transition will be a test to see whether the<br />
   pattern can hold, and the transition proceed in an orderly fashion.<br />
<br />
   The &quot;generational&quot; leadership framework was created by Deng, Although this<br />
   is not unique to China... &quot;generational effects&quot; are a rarely studied, but<br />
   very important, notion in politics. So you could speak to the concept in<br />
   general terms as well. This stuff is really really important and yet most<br />
   analysts -- including Stratfor -- rarely really give it much credence<br />
   (although in our case we know that it exists and we aknowledge it -- for<br />
   example in talking about Sarkozy as post Gaullist president -- but we<br />
   rarely focus on it because we don't really look at individuals much).  who<br />
   dubbed himself the core second generation leader after Mao. Each<br />
   generation has had defining characteristics, but the most important have<br />
   been their formative experiences in China's recent history. The Maoist<br />
   generation was defined by the formation of the Communist Party and the<br />
   Long March of exile in the 1930s. The second generation included those<br />
   whose defining experience was the war against the Japanese (WWII). The<br />
   third generation was defined by the Communist Revolution in 1949. The<br />
   fourth generation came of age during the Great Leap Forward, Mao's first<br />
   attempt to transform the Chinese economy in the late 1950s.<br />
<br />
   THE FIFTH GENERATION'S CHARACTERISTICS<br />
<br />
   The fifth generation is the first group of leaders who can hardly remember<br />
   a time before the founding of the People's Republic. These leaders'<br />
   formative experiences were shaped during the Cultural Revolution<br />
   (1967-77), a period of deep social and political upheaval in which the Mao<br />
   regime empowered party loyalists nationwide to wage class warfare against<br />
   the bureaucrats of the Communist party (we probably need to qualify the<br />
   concept of class warfare by specifically saying who the CR was directed<br />
   against, since the &quot;classes&quot; were not the same as in the West) and purge<br />
   political opponents. Schools and universities were closed in 1966 and<br />
   youths were &quot;sent down&quot; to rural areas in the northeast, southwest or<br />
   central regions to do manual labor, including many fifth generation<br />
   leaders such as likely future president Xi Jinping. Some young people were<br />
   able to return to college after 1970, where they could only study<br />
   Marxism-Leninism and CCP ideology, while others sought formal education<br />
   when schools were reopened after the Cultural Revolution ended.<br />
   Characteristically, the upcoming leaders will be the first in China to be<br />
   educated as lawyers, economists and social scientists, as opposed to the<br />
   engineers and natural scientists who have dominated the previous<br />
   generations of leadership.<br />
<br />
   In 2012, only Vice-President Xi Jinping and Vice-Premier Li Keqiang will<br />
   remain on the Politburo Standing Committee, and seven new members will<br />
   join (assuming the number of total members remains at nine), all drawn<br />
   from the full Politburo and born after October 1944 according to an<br />
   unspoken rule requiring Chinese leaders to retire at the age of 68. good<br />
   move... The current leaders will make every attempt to strike a deal that<br />
   preserves the balance of power within the Politburo and its Standing<br />
   Committee.<br />
<br />
   At present China's leaders divide roughly into two factions. First comes<br />
   the &quot;tuanpai,&quot; those leaders associated with President Hu Jintao and<br />
   China's Communist Youth League (CCYL), which Hu led in the 1980s and which<br />
   comprises his political base. The CCYL is a mass organization structured<br />
   like the CCP, with central leadership and provincial and local branches,<br />
   that teaches party doctrine and develops new generations of leaders. The<br />
   policies of this &quot;CCYL clique&quot; focus on maintaining social stability,<br />
   seeking to redistribute wealth to alleviate income disparities, regional<br />
   differences, and social ills. The clique has grown increasingly powerful<br />
   under Hu's patronage, since he has promoted people from CCYL backgrounds,<br />
   some of whom he worked with during his term at the group's secretariat,<br />
   and has increased the number of CCYL-affiliated leaders in China's<br />
   provincial governments. Several top candidates for the Politburo Standing<br />
   Committee in 2012 are part of this group, including Li Keqiang and Li<br />
   Yuanchao, followed by Liu Yandong, Zhang Baoshun, Yuan Chunqing, and Liu<br />
   Qibao.<br />
<br />
   Second come leaders associated with former President Jiang Zemin and his<br />
   Shanghai clique. Policies tend to aim at maintaining China's rapid<br />
   economic growth, with the coastal provinces unabashedly leading the way,<br />
   and pushing forward economic restructuring to improve China's<br />
   international competitiveness and cut back inefficiencies, even at the<br />
   risk of causing painful changes for some regions or sectors of society.<br />
   Distinct from but often associated with the Shanghai clique are the<br />
   infamous &quot;princelings,&quot; the sons, grandsons and relatives of the CCP's<br />
   founding fathers and previous leaders who have risen up the ranks of<br />
   China's system often with the help of familial connections. Though the<br />
   princelings are criticized for benefiting from undeserved privilege and<br />
   nepotism, and some have suffered from low support in internal party<br />
   elections, they have name recognition from their proud Communist family<br />
   histories and often have the finest educations and career experiences. The<br />
   Shanghai clique and princelings are joined by economic reformists of<br />
   various stripes who come from different backgrounds, mostly in state<br />
   apparatus such as the central or provincial bureaucracy and ministries,<br />
   often technocrats and specialists. Prominent members of this faction,<br />
   eligible for the 2012 Politburo Standing Committee, include Wang Qishan,<br />
   Zhang Dejiang, Bo Xilai, Yu Zhengsheng and Zhang Gaoli.<br />
<br />
   FACTIONAL BALANCE<br />
<br />
   The handful of politicians who are almost certain to join the Standing<br />
   Committee in 2012 appear to show a balance between factional tendencies.<br />
   The top two, Xi Jinping and Li Keqiang, are the youngest members of the<br />
   current Standing Committee and all but destined to become President Xi and<br />
   Premier Li. Xi is a princeling -- what is his lineage, would be<br />
   interesting to include -- and a model of the coastal manufacturing<br />
   power-nexus due to his experiences leading in Fujian, Zhejiang and<br />
   Shanghai. But Xi is also a people's politician, his hardships as a rural<br />
   worker during the Cultural Revolution make him widely admired. He is the<br />
   best example of bridging both major factions, promoting economic reforms<br />
   but being seen as having the people's best interests at heart. Meanwhile<br />
   Li is a lawyer, a former top secretary of the CCYL and a stalwart of Hu's<br />
   faction -- economics is his specialty but with the purposes of social<br />
   harmony in mind (for instance he is famous for promoting further<br />
   revitalization of the rust-belt Northeast industrial plant). Li also has<br />
   experience in leadership positions in the provinces, such as Henan, an<br />
   agricultural province, and Liaoning, a heavy-industrial province.<br />
<br />
   After Xi Jinping and Li Keqiang, the most likely contenders for seats on<br />
   the SCP are Li Yuanchao (CCYL clique), Wang Yang (CCYL), Liu Yunshan<br />
   (CCYL) and Wang Qishan (princeling). There is a remote possibility that<br />
   the number of members on the SCP could be cut from nine down to seven,<br />
   which was the number of posts before 2002. This would likely result in a<br />
   stricter enforcement of age limits in determining which leaders to<br />
   promote, perhaps setting the cut-off birthyear of 1945 or 1946 (instead of<br />
   1944). This would result, most likely, in eliminating from the contest<br />
   three leaders from Jiang Zemin's clique (Zhang Gaoli, Yu Zhengsheng, Zhang<br />
   Dejiang) and one from Hu Jintao's clique (Liu Yandong). This would leave<br />
   Bo Xilai (a princeling) and Ling Jihua (CCYL member and secretary to Hu<br />
   Jintao) as likely final additions to the SCP. The balance in this scenario<br />
   would lean in favor of Hu Jintao's clique.<br />
<br />
   But ultimately it is impossible to predict exactly which leaders will be<br />
   appointed to the SCP. The line up is the result of intense negotiation<br />
   between the current SCP members, with the retiring members (everyone<br />
   except Xi Jinping and Li Keqiang) wielding the most influence. Currently,<br />
   of nine SCP members, as many as six count as proteges of Jiang Zemin, and<br />
   they will push for their followers rather than letting Hu get the upper<br />
   hand. Moreover, the CCYL clique looks extremely well placed for 2017<br />
   reshuffle, at which point many of Jiang's proteges will be too old to sit<br />
   on the SCP, while Hu's followers will just be completing their terms as<br />
   provincial chiefs and ready for promotion. Therefore it seems possible<br />
   that the 2012 SCP balance will lean slightly in favor of Jiang's Shanghai<br />
   clique and the princelings, but that their advantage will not persist<br />
   throughout the entire ten years of the Xi and Li administration.<br />
<br />
   COLLECTIVE RULE<br />
<br />
   The factions are not so antagonistic as to point towards internecine power<br />
   struggle, but will exercise power by forging compromises and trying to act<br />
   as a collective. Leaders are chosen by their superiors through a process<br />
   of careful negotiation and balancing so as to prevent an imbalance of one<br />
   faction over another that could lead to purges or counter-purges. That<br />
   balance looks to be maintained in the configuration of leaders in 2012.<br />
   This factional balance suggests a continuation of the current style of<br />
   collective leadership, in which the leaders debate deep policy<br />
   disagreements behind close doors, and through a process of intense<br />
   negotiation arrive at a party line that will then be maintained uniformly<br />
   in public. The different sides of the often fierce debates will as usual<br />
   be echoed in statements by minor officials or academics, public<br />
   discussions, newspaper editorials, and other venues, and in extreme<br />
   situations could lead to the ousting of officials who end up on the wrong<br />
   side of a debate, but ultimately the party leaders will not openly<br />
   contradict each other unless a dire breakdown has occurred. Still it is<br />
   crucial to understand that maintaining the central factional balance is a<br />
   constant struggle, and extreme external or internal pressures hold out the<br />
   chance of unsettling even the surest of balances.<br />
<br />
    <br />
<br />
   That is a massive paragraph that says two things: Negotiations produce<br />
   leaders. Current system of balance will be preserved.<br />
<br />
   Conducive to maintaining the factional balance is the fact that the fifth<br />
   generation leadership appears in broad agreement on the state's core<br />
   economic and political commitments. First, there is general agreement on<br />
   the need to continue with China's internationally oriented economic and<br />
   structural reforms. These leaders spent the prime of their lives in the<br />
   midst of China's rapid economic transformation from a poor and isolated<br />
   pariah-state into an international industrial and commercial giant, and<br />
   were the first to experience the benefits of this transformation. They<br />
   also know that the CCP's legitimacy has come to rest, in great part, on<br />
   its ability to deliver greater economic opportunity and prosperity to the<br />
   country, and that the greatest risk to the regime would likely come in the<br />
   form of a shrinking or dislocated economy that causes massive<br />
   unemployment. Therefore they remain for the most part dedicated to<br />
   continuing with market-oriented reform, though they will do so gradually<br />
   and carefully and are unlikely to seek to accelerate or intensify<br />
   reformist efforts dramatically, since to do so would increase the risk of<br />
   social disruption.<br />
<br />
   Second, and far more importantly, all fifth generation leaders are<br />
   committed to maintaining the CCP's rule. The Cultural Revolution is<br />
   thought to have impressed upon them a sense of the dangers of China's<br />
   allowing internal political divisions and intra-party struggle to run<br />
   rampant. That is an important point that I would really emphasize Further,<br />
   the protest and military crackdown at Tiananmen Square in 1989, the<br />
   general rise in social unrest throughout the economic boom of the 1990s<br />
   and 2000s, the earthquake and riots in Tibet (2008) and Xinjiang (2009),<br />
   and the pressures of economic volatility since the global economic crisis<br />
   of 2008-9, have all further emphasized the need to maintain unity and<br />
   stability in the party ranks and in Chinese society. Therefore while the<br />
   Fifth Generation is likely to agree on the need to continue with reform,<br />
   it will do so only insofar as it can without causing massively<br />
   destabilizing social order, and will delay, soften, undermine, or reverse<br />
   reform in order to ensure stability.<br />
<br />
   REGIONALISM<br />
    <br />
   Beyond the apparent balance of forces in the central party and government<br />
   organs, there remains the tug-of-war between the central government in<br />
   Beijing and the 33 regional governments -- a reflection of the timeless<br />
   struggle between center and periphery. If China is to be struck by deep<br />
   destabilization under the watch of the fifth generation leaders, there is<br />
   a good chance it will happen along regional lines. Stark differences have<br />
   emerged as China's coastal manufacturing provinces have surged ahead,<br />
   while provinces in the interior,  west, and northeast lag behind. The<br />
   CCP's solution to this problem has generally been to redistribute wealth<br />
   from the booming coasts to the interior, effectively subsidizing the much<br />
   poorer and less-developed regions in the hope that they will eventually<br />
   develop more sustainable economies. In some cases, such as Anhui or<br />
   Sichuan provinces, urbanization and development have accelerated in recent<br />
   years. But in general the interior remains weak and dependent on<br />
   subsidization via Beijing.<br />
<br />
   The problem for China's leadership is that the coastal provinces'<br />
   export-led model of growth that has created wonderful returns throughout<br />
   the past three decades has begun to lose steam, as foreign demand reaches<br />
   its maximum and China's exporters experience rising labor and materials<br />
   costs and slash profit margins to razor thin levels to compete with each<br />
   other for market share. As the country struggles to readjust by increasing<br />
   domestic-driven consumption and upgrading the manufacturing sector, its<br />
   growth rates are expected to slow down, and the result will be shriller<br />
   demands from the poor provinces and tighter fists from the rich provinces<br />
   -- in other words, deepening competition and in some cases animosity<br />
   between the regions.<br />
<br />
   The fifth generation cohort, more so than any generation before it, has<br />
   extensive cross-regional career experience. This is because in order to<br />
   climb to the top ranks of party and government, these leaders have<br />
   followed the increasingly entrenched prerequisite for promotion that<br />
   involves serving in central organizations in Beijing, then rotating to do<br />
   a stint as governor or party secretary of one of the provinces (the<br />
   farther flung, the better), and then returning to a higher central party<br />
   or government position in Beijing. Furthermore it has become increasingly<br />
   common to put officials in charge of a region different from where they<br />
   originally hailed, so as to reduce regional biases. Of the most likely<br />
   members of the 2012 Politburo Standing Committee (the core of the core of<br />
   Chinese power), a greater proportion than ever before has experience<br />
   serving as a provincial chief -- which means that when these leaders take<br />
   over the top national positions they will have a better grasp of the<br />
   realities facing the provinces they rule, and will be less likely to be<br />
   beholden to a single regional constituency or support base. This could<br />
   somewhat mitigate the central government's difficulty in dealing with<br />
   profound divergences of interest between the central and provincial<br />
   governments. I think this is a key graph in here, and then another one to<br />
   really temper the argument that they can do much since this is also<br />
   grounded in geographical and economic realities. At that point, this<br />
   section could be significantly shortened.<br />
<br />
   Nevertheless regional differences are grounded in fundamental,<br />
   geographical realities, and have become increasingly aggravated by the<br />
   disproportionate benefits of China's economic success. Temporary changes<br />
   of position across the country have not prevented China's leaders from<br />
   forming lasting loyalty bonds with certain provincial chiefs to the<br />
   neglect of others. The patron-client system, by which Chinese officials<br />
   give their loyalty to superiors in exchange for political perks or<br />
   monetary rewards, remains fully intact, extending to massive personal<br />
   networks across party and government bureaus, from the center to the<br />
   regions. Few central leaders remain impervious to the pull of these<br />
   regional networks, and none can remain in power long if his regional power<br />
   base or bases has been cut. In sum, the tension between the center and<br />
   provinces will remain one of the greatest sources of stress on the central<br />
   leadership as they negotiate national policy.<br />
<br />
   As with any novice political leadership, the fifth generation leaders will<br />
   take office with little experience of what it means to be fully in charge.<br />
   Not only are they untested, but also the individual members do not show<br />
   signs of strong leadership capabilities -- only one of the upcoming<br />
   members of the Politburo Standing Committee has military experience (Xi<br />
   Jinping, and it is slight), and few of the others (Wang Qishan, Bo Xilai)<br />
   have shown independence or forcefulness in their leadership style, since<br />
   these qualities tend to be liabilities in the current political system,<br />
   which is rigidly conformist and intensely competitive. The fact that the<br />
   future Politburo Standing Committee members will be chosen by the current<br />
   members, after painstaking negotiations, may preserve the balance of power<br />
   between the cliques, but it will also result in a &quot;compromise&quot; leadership<br />
   -- effectively one that will strive for the middle-of-the-road and<br />
   achieve, at best, mediocrity. A collective leadership of such members is<br />
   potentially incapable of acting quickly enough, or resolutely enough, to<br />
   respond to the economic, social and foreign policy challenges that they<br />
   will likely face during their tenure. The fifth generation leaders are<br />
   likely to be reactive, like the current administration -- and where they<br />
   are proactive it will be on decisions pertaining to domestic security and<br />
   social stability.<br />
<br />
   PART TWO -- MILITARY LEADERSHIP<br />
<br />
   China's military will also see a sweeping change in leadership in 2012.<br />
   The military's influence over China's politics and policy has grown over<br />
   the past decade. Looking at the upcoming top military elites, the picture<br />
   that emerges is of a military whose influence will continue to grow in<br />
   managing domestic stability and foreign policy. China will still have to<br />
   try to avoid direct confrontation with the US and maintain good relations<br />
   internationally, but the military's growing influence is likely to<br />
   encourage a more assertive China, especially in the face of growing<br />
   threats to the country's internal stability and external security.<br />
<br />
   Promotions for China's top military leaders are based on the officer's<br />
   age, his current official position -- for instance, whether he sits on the<br />
   CMC or in the Central Committee -- and his &quot;factional&quot; alliances. Officers<br />
   born after 1944 will be too old for promotion since they will be 67 in<br />
   2012, which means they would pass the de facto retirement age of 68 in the<br />
   midst of their term. Those fitting the age requirement and holding<br />
   positions on the CMC,  CCP Central Committee, or a leading position in one<br />
   of China's military services or seven regional military commands may be<br />
   eligible for promotion.<br />
<br />
   The Central Military Commission (CMC) is the most powerful military body,<br />
   comprising the top ten military chiefs, and chaired by the country's<br />
   civilian leader. China's foremost leader, at the height of his power,<br />
   serves simultaneously as the president of the state, the general-secretary<br />
   of the party, and the chairman of the military commission, as President Hu<br />
   Jintao currently does. The top leader does not always hold all three<br />
   positions -- Jiang famously kept hold of his chair on the CMC for two<br />
   years after his term as president ended in 2002. Since Hu therefore did<br />
   not become CMC chairman until 2004, he will presumably maintain his chair<br />
   until 2014, well after he gives up his presidency and party throne.<br />
<br />
   Interestingly, however, Hu has not yet appointed Vice-President Xi Jinping<br />
   to be his successor on the CMC, creating a swirl of rumors over the past<br />
   year about whether Hu is reluctant to give Xi the post, or whether Xi's<br />
   position could be at risk. But Hu will almost certainly dub Xi his<br />
   successor on the CMC, likely in October, ensuring that Xi serves beneath<br />
   him during his last two years as CMC chairman. Thus, while Xi is set to<br />
   take over the party and state leadership in 2012, his influence over the<br />
   military will remain subordinate to Hu's until at least 2014, raising<br />
   uncertainties about how Hu and Xi will interact with each other and with<br />
   the military during this time.<br />
<br />
   OLD AND NEW TRENDS<br />
<br />
   Of the leading military figures, there are several observable trends.<br />
   Regional favoritism in recruitment and promotion remains a powerful force,<br />
   and regions that have had the greatest influence on military leadership in<br />
   the past will maintain that influence: Shandong, Hebei, Henan, Shaanxi and<br />
   Liaoning provinces, respectively, appear likely to remain the top regions<br />
   represented by the new leadership. So it is loyalty of regions to Beijing<br />
   that allows one to be promoted in the military... that is really<br />
   interesting.  These provinces are core provinces for the CCP's support<br />
   base; there is considerably less representation from Shanghai, Guangdong,<br />
   or Sichuan, or the western regions, all of which are known for regionalism<br />
   and are more likely to stand at variance with Beijing.<br />
<br />
   One faction, the princelings (children or relatives of Communist Party<br />
   revolutionary heroes and elites), are likely to take a much greater role<br />
   in the CMC in 2012 than in the current CMC. In politics the princelings<br />
   are not necessarily a coherent faction with agreed-upon policy leanings,<br />
   though they share similar elite backgrounds, their careers have benefited<br />
   from these privileges, and they are viewed and treated as a single group<br />
   by everyone else. However, in the military, the princelings are more<br />
   likely to form a unified group capable of coherent policy, since the<br />
   military is more rigidly hierarchical, personal ties are based on staunch<br />
   loyalty, and princeling loyalties are reinforced by familial ties and<br />
   inherited from fathers, grandfathers and other relatives. The strong<br />
   princeling presence could produce a military leadership that is more<br />
   assertive or even nationalistic, especially if the civilian leaders prove<br />
   to be incapable of strong leadership.<br />
<br />
   A marked difference in the upcoming CMC is the rising role of the PLA Navy<br />
   (PLAN) and Air Force (PLAAF), as against the traditionally dominant army.<br />
   The army will remain the most influential service across the entire fifth<br />
   generation military leadership, with the missile corps, air force, and<br />
   navy following close behind. But crucially -- in the CMC expected to take<br />
   shape in 2012 -- the army's representation is likely to decline relative<br />
   to the navy and air force. The upgrade in the navy and air force<br />
   representation reflects important changes taking place in China's evolving<br />
   21st century military strategy. Sea and air power are increasingly<br />
   important as China focuses on the ability to secure its international<br />
   supply chains and prevent greater foreign powers (namely the United<br />
   States) from using their air or sea power to approach too closely to<br />
   China's strategic areas. The greater standing of the PLAN and PLAAF is<br />
   already showing signs of solidifying, since officers from these services<br />
   used not to be guaranteed representation on the CMC but now appear to have<br />
   a permanent place.<br />
<br />
   [[Potentially, the upcoming CMC could have a heavier focus on military<br />
   operations. Typically the two vice-chairmen of the CMC -- the most<br />
   powerful military leaders, since the chairmanship goes to the top civilian<br />
   leader -- are divided between one officer whose career centered on<br />
   military operations and another whose career centered on the military's<br />
   &quot;political affairs.&quot; This creates a balance between the military and<br />
   political responsibilities within the military leadership. However,<br />
   because of the candidates available for the position, there is a slim<br />
   possibility that the precedent will be broken and the positions will be<br />
   filled with officers who both come from a military operational background.<br />
   Such a configuration in the CMC could result in higher emphasis put on the<br />
   capability and effectiveness of the PLA to solve problems. The potential<br />
   weakness of such a set up may be a CMC that is not adept with politics,<br />
   public relations or administrative matters. But having two military<br />
   affairs specialists in the vice-chairmen seats is merely a possibility,<br />
   and there are available personnel from political affairs to fill one of<br />
   the seats, thus preserving the traditional balance.]] [**this is a bit<br />
   controversial of a paragraph, could potentially be cut.**]]   Might as<br />
   well leave it...<br />
<br />
   RISING MILITARY INFLUENCE<br />
<br />
   The fifth generation military leaders will take office at a time when the<br />
   military's budget, stature and influence over politics is growing. This<br />
   trend appears highly likely to continue in the coming years, for the<br />
   following reasons: <br />
<br />
     o First, maintaining internal stability in China has resulted in several<br />
       high-profile cases in which the armed forces played a critical role.<br />
       Natural disasters such as massive flooding (1998, 2010) and<br />
       earthquakes (especially the one in Sichuan in 2008), have required the<br />
       military to provide relief and assistance, gaining more attention in<br />
       military planning and improving the military's public image. Because<br />
       China is geographically prone to natural disasters, and its<br />
       environmental difficulties have gotten worse as its massive population<br />
       and economy have put greater pressure on the landscape, the military<br />
       is expected to continue playing a greater role in disaster relief,<br />
       including by offering to help abroad [LINK to Haiti piece]. At the<br />
       same time, the rising frequency of social unrest, including riots and<br />
       ethnic violence in rogue regions like Xinjiang and Tibet, has led to<br />
       military involvement. As the trend of rising social unrest looks to<br />
       continue in the coming years, so the military will be called upon to<br />
       restore order, especially through the elite People's Armed Police,<br />
       which is also under the direct control of the CMC.<br />
     o Second, as China's economy has risen to the rank of second largest in<br />
       the world, its international dependencies have increased. China<br />
       depends on stable and secure supply lines to maintain imports of<br />
       energy, raw materials, and components and exports of components and<br />
       finished goods. Most of these commodities and merchandise are traded<br />
       over sea, often through choke points such as the Strait of Hormuz and<br />
       Strait of Malacca, making them vulnerable to interference from piracy,<br />
       terrorism, conflicts between foreign states, or interdiction by navies<br />
       hostile to China (such as the United States, India or Japan).<br />
       Therefore it needs the People's Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) to expand<br />
       its capabilities and reach so as to secure these vital supplies --<br />
       otherwise the economy would be exposed to potential shocks that could<br />
       translate into social and political disturbances.<br />
     o Third, competition with foreign states is intensifying as China has<br />
       become more economically powerful and internationally conspicuous. In<br />
       addition to mounting capabilities to assert its sovereignty over<br />
       Taiwan, China has become more aggressive in defending its sovereignty<br />
       and territorial claims in its neighboring seas -- especially in the<br />
       South China Sea, which Beijing elevated in 2010 to a &quot;core&quot; national<br />
       interest like Taiwan or Tibet, and also in the East China Sea. This<br />
       assertiveness has led to rising tension with neighbors that have<br />
       competing claims on potentially resource-rich territory in the seas,<br />
       including Vietnam, the Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia, Brunei, and<br />
       also Japan. Moreover, Beijing's newfound assertiveness has clashed<br />
       with the United States' moves to bulk up its alliances and<br />
       partnerships in the region [LINK to US-SEA mega-piece], which Beijing<br />
       sees as a strategy aimed at constraining China's rise. At the same<br />
       time, China is raising its profile in international missions other<br />
       than war.<br />
     o Fourth, China's military modernization remains a primary national<br />
       policy focus. Military modernization includes acquiring and innovating<br />
       advanced weaponry, improving information technology and<br />
       communications, heightening capabilities on sea and in the air, and<br />
       developing capabilities in new theaters such as cyberwarfare and outer<br />
       space. It also entails improving Chinese forces' mobility, rapid<br />
       reaction, special forces and ability to conduct combined operations<br />
       between different military services.<br />
     o Lastly, the PLA has become more vocal in the public sphere, making<br />
       statements and issuing editorials in forums like the PLA Daily and,<br />
       for the most part, garnering positive public responses. In many cases<br />
       military officers have voiced a nationalistic point of view shared by<br />
       large portions of the public (only one prominent military officer,<br />
       named Liu Yazhou, has used his standing to call for China to pursue<br />
       western style democratic political reforms). Military officials can<br />
       strike a more nationalist pose where politicians would have trouble<br />
       due to consideration for foreign relations and the concern that<br />
       nationalism is becoming an insuppressible force of its own.<br />
   All of the above suggests a rising current of military power in the<br />
   Chinese system. Nevertheless the fifth generation leadership does not<br />
   raise the specter of a military usurpation of civilian rule. While both<br />
   Mao and Deng could alter rules as needed, they both reinforced the model<br />
   of civilian leadership over military. The Communist Party retains control<br />
   of the central and provincial bureaucracies, the state-owned corporations<br />
   and banks, mass organizations, and most of the media. Moreover currently<br />
   there does not appear to be a single military strongman who could lead a<br />
   significant challenge to civilian leadership. So while the military's sway<br />
   is undoubtedly rising, and the civilian factions could get stuck in<br />
   stalemate, nevertheless the military is not in the position to step in and<br />
   seize power.<br />
