		<h3>Tor</h3>
		<p><a href="https://www.torproject.org">Tor</a> is an encrypted anonymising network that makes it harder to intercept internet communications, or see where communications are coming from or going to.</p>
		<p>In order to use the WikiLeaks public submission system as detailed above you can download the Tor Browser Bundle, which is a Firefox-like browser available for Windows, Mac OS X and GNU/Linux and pre-configured to connect using the anonymising system Tor.</p>
		<h4>Tails</h4>
		<p>If you are at high risk and you have the capacity to do so, you can also access the submission system through a secure operating system called <a href="https://tails.boum.org">Tails</a>. Tails is an operating system launched from a USB stick or a DVD that aim to leaves no traces when the computer is shut down after use and automatically routes your internet traffic through Tor. Tails will require you to have either a USB stick or a DVD at least 4GB big and a laptop or desktop computer.</p>

		<h3>Tips</h3>
		<p>Our submission system works hard to preserve your anonymity, but we recommend you also take some of your own precautions. Please review these basic guidelines. </p>
		<div>
			<h4>1. Contact us if you have specific problems</h4>
			<p>If you have a very large submission, or a submission with a complex format, or are a high-risk source, please <a href="#submit_help_contact">contact us</a>. In our experience it is always possible to find a custom solution for even the most seemingly difficult situations.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h4>2. What computer to use</h4>
			<p>If the computer you are uploading from could subsequently be audited in an investigation, consider using a computer that is not easily tied to you. Technical users can also use <a href="https://tails.boum.org">Tails</a> to help ensure you do not leave any records of your submission on the computer.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h4>3. Do not talk about your submission to others</h4>
			<p>If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in source protection – it is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This includes other media organisations.</p>
		</div>

	</div>

		<h3>After</h3>

		<div>
			<h4>1. Do not talk about your submission to others</h4>
			<p>If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in source protection – it is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This includes other media organisations.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h4>2. Act normal</h4>
			<p>If you are a high-risk source, avoid saying anything or doing anything after submitting which might promote suspicion. In particular, you should try to stick to your normal routine and behaviour.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h4>3. Remove traces of your submission</h4>
			<p>If you are a high-risk source and the computer you prepared your submission on, or uploaded it from, could subsequently be audited in an investigation, we recommend that you format and dispose of the computer hard drive and any other storage media you used.</p>
			<p>In particular, hard drives retain data after formatting which may be visible to a digital forensics team and flash media (USB sticks, memory cards and SSD drives) retain data even after a secure erasure. If you used flash media to store sensitive data, it is important to destroy the media.</p>
			<p>If you do this and are a high-risk source you should make sure there are no traces of the clean-up, since such traces themselves may draw suspicion.</p>
			<div>
				<h4>4. If you face legal action</h4>
				<p>If a legal action is brought against you as a result of your submission, there are organisations that may help you. The Courage Foundation is an international organisation dedicated to the protection of journalistic sources. You can find more details at <a href="https://www.couragefound.org">https://www.couragefound.org</a>.</p>

		<p>WikiLeaks publishes documents of political or historical importance that are censored or otherwise suppressed. We specialise in strategic global publishing and large archives.</p>
		<p>The following is the address of our secure site where you can anonymously upload your documents to WikiLeaks editors. You can only access this submissions system through Tor. (See our <a href="#submit_help_tor">Tor tab</a> for more information.) We also advise you to read our <a href="#submit_help_tips">tips for sources</a> before submitting.</p>

			<!--<div>
				Copy this address into your Tor browser. Advanced users, if they wish, can also add a further layer of encryption to their submission using <a href="#submit_wlkey">our public PGP key</a>.
			</div>-->
		</div>

		<p>If you cannot use Tor, or your submission is very large, or you have specific requirements, WikiLeaks provides several alternative methods. <a href="#submit_help_contact">Contact us</a> to discuss how to proceed.</p>

NON-MIL SOLUTIONS.

&quot;SUCH A CORRESPONDENT&quot; IN 48 HOURS; HE DID NOT HAVE
NYT IN MIND WHEN HE MADE STATEMENT.  UPI SAIGON BUREAU
CHIEF STANDS BEHIND VIET REPORTER WHO SAID THAT SPOKESMAN
IDENTIFIED PAPER AS NYT WHEN HE TALKED TO HIM IMMEDIATELY
AFTER THE BRIEFING.  SEVERAL SVN NEWS ORGANIZATIONS
IDENTIFIED OTHER PAPERS AS PRESUMED TARGET, AND NYT
SAIGON BUREAU CHIEF MARKHAM SAYS THAT NO ONE IN HIS
BUREAU MADE ANY THREATS TO GVN (NYT).

BREAK IN TALKS, QUOTES VC DELEGATION CHIEF THAT HE
PLANS TO LEAVE PARIS SHORTLY, AND COMMENTS THAT PHRASE
IN VC STATEMENT ANNOUNCING BREAK SEEMS TO INDICATE
THAT HE WOULD RETURN IF AGREEMENT REACHED ON TERMS.

COMMENT AND ANALYSIS

CHINA

17.  CHOU'S REDUCED ROLE IN VARIOUS STATE FUNCTIONS
PROMPTS JOURNALISTIC CHINA-WATCHERS IN HK TO
SPECULATE ON ITS MEANING.  CHOU'S FAILURE TO APPEAR
AT BANQUET GIVEN BY SENGHOR, GETTING EQUAL (RATHER
THAN TOP) BILLING WITH A DEPUTY PREMIER DURING MAO'S
MEETING WITH BHUTTO, PROMPTS S-N'S BRADSHER (MAY 13)
TO EXPRESS VIEW THAT CHOU'S &quot;ACTUAL IMPORTANCE IN
CHINA HAS FADED FAR FROM WHAT THE WORLD LONG KNEW AND
STILL IS INCLINED TO ASSUME.&quot;  SUN'S ED WU, ON OTHER
HAND, OBSERVES OFFICIAL MEDIA STILL GIVING CHOU,
EXECUTOR OF DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN POLICY, SAME GLOWING
TREATMENT HE HAS ALWAYS ENJOYED.  WU SEES CHOU'S
CURTAILED PARTICIPATION IN OFFICIAL ENGAGMENTS AS
NECESSITATED BY ADVANCING AGE, ADDING THAT FACTS HAVE
SHOWN THAT CHOU IS STILL FIRMLY IN CONTROL OF AFFAIRS
UNCLASSIFIED

PAGE 07  STATE  100216

OF STATE.

18.  NYT'S LELYVELD EXPRESSES UNCERTAINTY WHETHER CHOU'S
WITHDRAWALS FROM ACTIVE ROLE IN VARIOUS STATE FUNCTIONS
IS VOLUNTARY OR UNDER PRESSURE.  SAYS STRESS ON CHOU'S
AGE SUGGESTS THAT ABSENCES SIGNIFY MORE THAN TEMPORARY

INDISPOSITION.  NOTES THAT PHOTO TAKEN DURING BHUTTO'S
MEETING WITH MAO SHOWED WHAT APPEARED TO BE   SYMBOLIC
SHIFT IN RITUALISTIC SEATING ARRANGEMENT, WITH CHOU'S
INVARIABLE SEAT TO MAO'S RIGHT OCCUPIED BY TENG HSIAO-PING
CHOU SAT ON MAO'S LEFT, NEXT TO BHUTTO IN WHAT WAS STILL
A PLACE OF HONOR.  FACT THAT THIS LEFT CHOU SITTING
CLOSER TO MAO THAN WANG HUNG-WEN, THIRD RANKING
FIGURE IN CP HIERARCHY, INDICATES CHOU STILL RANKS
NO. 2.  AND WHEN CHOU CONFERRED WITH BHUTTO ON MAY
12, NCNA GAVE TENG EQUAL BILLING.  LELYVELD NOTES
ALSO THAT CHOU'S PLACE WAS TAKEN BY ANOTHER DEPUTY
PREMIER, LI HSIEN-NIEN, AT EARLIER FUNCTION HONORING
SENGHOR.  OBSERVES THAT CHANGE IN LEADERSHIP PATTERN
COMES IN MIDST OF ANTI-CONFUCIUS AND ANTI-LIN PIAO
CAMPAIGN WHICH SOME ANALYSTS BELIEVE IS DIRECTED
AGAINST CHOU; WHILE OTHERS HAVE MAINTAINED UNTIL
RECENTLY THAT CHOU WAS ACTUALLY DIRECTING CAMPAIGN.
SAYS WHETHER OR NOT CHOU IS EVER OPENLY ATTACKED,
SUDDEN WANING OF HIS STAMINA IS CLEAR INDICATION
THAT HE IS NOT PRIME FORCE BEHIND ANTI-CONFUCIUS
CAMPAIGN.

PRC PRESS TAKES PAINS TO INDICATE CHOU HAS NOT BEEN
DISGRACED; LATEST EXAMPLE WAS NCNA'S &quot;UNUSUAL&quot; DISPATCH
ON TEA BY HIS WIFE FOR SVN &quot;WOMEN'S UNION FOR LIBERA-
TION.&quot;

19.  OF CHOU'S REDUCED ACTIVITIES, WP'S GREENWAY
SAYS CHOU MIGHT WELL FEEL NEED TO SHARE SOME STATE
RESPONSIBILITIES REGARDLESS OF POLITICAL PRESSURES,
BUT NOTES THAT CURRENT POLITICAL CAMPAIGN SEEMS
MORE AND MORE A SERIOUS CHALLENGE TO HIS POLICIES
AS THE SHATTERED PARTY WHICH HE WORKED SO HARD TO
REBUILD AFTER THE GPCR AGAIN SHOWS SIGNS OF SEVERE
UNCLASSIFIED

PAGE 08  STATE  100216

DISUNITY AND STRESS.  ONE VIEW POPULAR IN WASHINGTON
FOR A WHILE WAS THAT THERE WAS NO SERIOUS POLITICAL
THREAT TO CHOU AND THAT CAMPAIGN WAS IN FACT CHOU
MOVING IN STRENGTH AGAINST RADICAL LEFT.  &quot;IT WAS
A COMFORTING VIEW GIVEN SECRETARY OF STATE HENRY
KISSINGER'S PERSONAL AND DIPLOMATIC INVESTMENT IN
CHOU.&quot;  BUT AS CAMPAIGN ROLLED ON, EVIDENCE MOUNTED
THAT THE LEFT, AND PERHAPS MAO'S WIFE, WAS USING
CAMPAIGN TO ENHANCE THEIR POSITION AND THAT CHOU
AND HIS MODERATES WERE FINDING IT DIFFICULT TO CONTINUE.
AS WESTERN CHINA-WATCHERS PORE OVER CHINESE PRESS
FOR HINTS OF CHANGE, CHINA'S AMERICA-WATCHERS MAY
WELL HAVE TAKEN RECENT RESTON COLUMN IN NYT AS INDICATIVE

OF CHANGE IN US ATTITUDE.  RESTON WROTE LAST MONTH
THAT ALTHOUGH CHOU REMAINED PM, HE SEEMED TO BE
LESS PROMINENT NOW THAN BEFORE.  ARTICLE SAID THAT
HAK WAS MUCH TOO SHREWD AND EXPERIENCED TO MAKE
POLICY WITH A MAN INSTEAD OF A COUNTRY AND THAT
ALTHOUGH HAK HAD BEEN IMPRESSED WITH CHOU, CHOU
SEEMED TO BE 'LOSING HIS INFLUENCE AND CHANGING
HIS TUNE.&quot;  TENG HSIAO-PING'S VISIT TO NY WAS, RESTON
ARTICLE SUGGESTED, MAINLY TO SEE HAK.  NOWADAYS,
SAYS RESTON, MESSAGES FROM MAO TO WASHINGTON COME
THROUGH &quot;DIFFERENT ENVOYS,&quot; NO LONGER THROUGH CHOU.
GREENWAY NOTES THAT CHOU IS A BORN SURVIVOR WHO
HAS TRIED TO KEEP THINGS TOGETHER BY JOINING MAO'S
POLITICAL MOVEMENTS IN TIME TO AVOID BEING OVERWHELMED.
AT SAME TIME, HE MAY FEEL DANGEROUSLY EXPOSED, REMEMBERING
FATE OF LIU SHAO-CHI AND LIN PIAO.  HENCE, ALTHOUGH
HIS NON-ATTENDANCE AT RECENT EVENTS WAS PROBABLY
BECAUSE OF ILLNESS AND FATIGUE, HE ALSO MAY FEEL
NEED TO INVOLVE MORE OF HIS COLLEAGUES IN THESE
EVENTS IN ORDER NOT TO FEEL EXPOSED AND OUT IN FRONT
DURING DIFFICULT TIMES.

20.  VICTOR ZORZA RETURNS TO CHINA DEBATE WITH CONCLUSION

DISPUTE WITH USSR.  SAYS US INTELLIGENCE SHOWS THERE
HAS BEEN SURGE OF REQUESTS FROM FACTORY MANAGERS
FOR IMPORTS OF FOREIGN EQUIPMENT WHICH HAS ALARMED
PRC LEADERSHIP, WHICH KNOWS CHINA LACKS FUNDS TO
SATISFY REQUESTS.  US OFFICIALS ARGUE THAT PRC PROPAGANDA
CAMPAIGN IS THEREFORE DESIGNED TO DAMP DOWN IMPORT
DEMAND RATHER THAN STIMULATE HOSTILITY TO US.  BUT
IN PRESENT POWER STRUGGLE, DENUNCIATIONS OF REVISIONISTS,
SAYS ZORZA, ARE AIMED AT CHOU EN-LAI.  CITES RECENT
ARTICLE ATTACKING HU SHIH AS DRAWING IMPLIED PARALLELS
BETWEEN CAREERS OF BOTH MEN.  AND AMONG REVISIONISTS
UNDER ATTACK IS CHOU'S &quot;CLOSEST ASSOCIATE&quot; IN POLITBURO,
REFORMED REVISIONIST TENG HSIAO-P'ING.  TENG IS

INDEED AN ARMY - MEMBERS OF PLA, BUT TANZANIANS

GRATEFUL TO COUNTRY WHICH OFFERED TO FUND PROJECT

THAT THE &quot;KHMER ROUGE DID NOT TREAT US LIKE CAMBODIANS.
THE KHMER ROUGE SAID NO ONE COULD GET MARRIED BECAUSE
IT WAS BAD TO MAKE LOVE...WE COULD NOT RESPECT BUDDHISM...
THEY...MADE MONKS WORK...WE COULD NOT KEEP WHAT
WE GREW.  THEY COLLECTED EVERYTHING AND PUT IT IN
A COMMON STOCK.&quot;  ANOTHER SAID &quot;WE HAD NO LIBERTY.
THEY DIDN'T ALLOW FAMILIES TO LIVE TOGETHER...EVERYBODY
HAD TO WORK BUT THE SMALLEST CHILDREN.  THE OLD
MEN AND WOMEN TOOK CARE OF THEM.&quot;  GREEN REMARKS
THAT RIGID LIFE STYLE OF KHMER ROUGE IS APPARENTLY
ALIENATING CAMBODIANS ACCUSTOMED TO MINIMAL WORK

23.  IN DISPATCH FROM PP (ATLANTA CONSTITUTION MAY

AND GRUNK HAVE MOUNTED DIPLOMATIC OFFENSIVES.  WHILE
FM KEUKY LIM IS IN NY ATTEMPTING TO LINE UP VOTES,
KHIEU SAMPHAN, ALLEGEDLY ONE OF THREE COMMUNIST
REBELS SECRETLY EXECUTED BY SIHANOUK, TURNED UP
IN HANOI AND PEKING A FEW WEEKS BACK AND IS NOW
MAKING ROUNDS IN AFRICA.  SAMPHAN'S MOVE SEEN BY
DIPLOMATIC OBSERVERS AS DUAL ATTEMPT TO INCREASE
HIS INTERNATIONAL STATURE WHILE PROVING TO UN MEMBER
NATIONS THAT REBELS DO HAVE LEADERSHIP WITHIN CAMBODIA.
OTHER ANALYSTS SEE EMERGENCE OF SAMPHAN AS REBEL

ATTEMPT PUBLICLY TO UNDERMINE SIHANOUK.  INFORMED
DIPLOMATS SAY IF LON NOL GOVT WERE OUSTED FROM UN,
US SUPPORT FOR REGIME WOULD NOT BE AFFECTED.  HOWEVER,
SOURCES BELIEVE OUSTER WOULD AFFECT RELATIONS BETWEEN
GKR AND OTHER NATIONS WHICH NOW SUPPLY SMALL BUT
IMPORTANT AMOUNTS OF AID.  ANALYSTS ALSO BELIEVE
OUSTER OF GKR AND RECOGNITION OF REBELS WOULD COMPLICATE
EFFORTS TO NEGOTIATE SETTLEMENT, HARDENING INSURGENTS
AGAINST COMPROMISE.

CITES SECDEF AS MAKING POINT THAT WHEN WE WITHDREW

'GIVE US THE TOOLS AND WE WILL DO THE JOB.' INSTEAD
WE INFORMED THEM THAT WE WOULD GIVE THEM THE TOOLS
AND THE MUNITIONS AND THEY WERE EXPECTED TO DO THE

CIVILIANS.  CITES  HIGH-RANKING US ARMY OFFICER THAT
EXPENSIVE MEKONG TRANSSHIPMENT ROUTE (VIA VN) IS REQUIRED

THAT JAPAN WOULD NEED 3 YEARS, &quot;IF LUCKY,&quot; AND PROBABLY

BACK INTO BALANCE.  FUKUDA DECLINED TO PREDICT HOW
MUCH TRADE SURPLUS JAPAN WOULD NEED TO BALANCE ITS
OVERALL PAYMENTS AFTER SUFFERING 13 BIL DOLS DEFICIT
IN FY 73.  HE MAINTAINS THAT &quot;A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF
BLACK INK&quot; IN TRADE WILL BE NECESSARY TO COVER DEFICITS
CAUSED BY SUCH FACTORS AS TOURIST SPENDING, SHIPPING
FEES, AND LONG-TERM CAPITAL OUTFLOW.  BUT IF FIGURE
GETS TOO BIG, THAT WOULD CAUSE PROBLEMS AGAIN.  &quot;YOUR
COUNTRY,&quot; FUKUDA SAYS TO AMERICAN REPORTER, &quot;WOULD
BE AMONG THE FIRST TO START COMPLAINING AGAIN.&quot;
QUOTES FUKUDA AS DECLARING THAT INTERNATIONAL PAYMENTS
ISSUE IS EVEN MORE OF A PROBLEM FOR JAPAN THAN SKYROCKETING
PRICES.  HE SAYS THAT JAPAN WOULD BE ABLE TO PAY
AN ADDITIONAL BILL FOR HIGHER COSTS OF IMPORTED OIL
IN FY 74 OF 10  BIL DOLS ON THE HEELS OF ITS 13 BIL
PAYMENTS DEFICIT LAST YEAR AND STILL CUT ITS OVERALL
PAYMENTS DEFICIT TO ABOUT HALF, OR BETWEEN 6 AND
7 BIL.  POINTS OUT THAT INTERNATIONAL INFLATION WOULD
ALLOW JAPAN TO RAISE PRICES OF ITS EXPORTS TO COVER
THE GAP.  FUKUDA SAYS JAPAN'S PAYMENTS PROBLEM DICTATED
SLOW-DOWN IN JAPAN'S GROWTH RATE TO LEVEL OF OTHER
DEVELOPED COUNTRIES.

CONTROVERSIAL, ALTHOUGH NOT BECAUSE ECONOMIC LEADERS
FEAR DROP IN OUTPUT OR OTHER ECONOMIC DISASTER.
SOME BUSINESSMEN WELCOME SHORTER WORK WEEK, BUT
DO NOT KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH THEIR EXTRA DAY OFF.
OTHERS WORRY THAT JAPANESE WILL LOSE THEIR FAMED
WORK ETHIC, AND STILL OTHERS DEFEND EXTRA TIME OFF
AS COMPENSATION DUE THEM FOR YEARS OF HARD WORK.
CITES ONE EXECUTIVE'S CONCERN THAT TWO-DAY WEEKEND
MAY HAVE EFFECT OF MAKING JAPANESE TOO SOFT; HE
NOTED &quot;WHAT HAPPENED IN AMERICA&quot; -- DIFFERENCES
BETWEEN TODAY AND 1930S-40S WHEN &quot;AMERICANS WERE
WORKHORSES.&quot;

14.  JOC'S CULLISON, IN TOKYO, SAYS JAPANESE MANUFACTURERS
OF CHEMICAL AND SYNTHETIC TEXTILES HOPE THAT DURING
UPCOMING US-JAPAN NEGOTIATIONS ON TEXTILE AGREEMENT
REVISION, US DELEGATION WILL AGREE TO LIBERALIZE
EXPORT OF THEIR PRODUCTS TO US MARKET.  TALKS, TO
OPEN IN WASHINGTON MAY 27, ARE CONSIDERED TOP-PRIORITY
BY JAPANESE TEXTILE INDUSTRY, AND LEADERS WITHIN
INDUSTRY ARE ATTEMPTING TO DEVELOP COMMON POSITION
ACCEPTABLE TO ALL SECTORS.

15.  LAT'S JAMESON, IN TOKYO, SAYS SATURDAY'S CONFIRMATION
THAT GOJ HAS TAKEN &quot;UNPRECEDENTED STEP&quot; OF INDIRECTLY
WARNING ITS CITIZENS AGAINST TRAVELING TO SOUTH
KOREA MARKS FIRST TIME TOKYO HAS ISSUED WARNING
AGAINST TRAVELING TO NONWAR ZONE, AND APPEARS TO
UNDERSCORE NEW LEVEL OF TENSIONS BETWEEN SEOUL AND
TOKYO -- MAJOR SOURCE OF ECON AID TO SK.  WHILE
IMPACT ON HEAVY FLOW OF JAPANESE TOURISTS TO SK
CANNOT BE FORETOLD, POTENTIAL ECON DAMAGE TO SK
APPEARS LARGE.  JAPANESE CONTRIBUTED MOST OF 324
PERCENT IN TOURISM REVENUE SK RECORDED LAST YEAR.
JAPANESE APPLYING FOR PASSPORTS TO SK WILL HENCEFORTH
NOT ONLY BE ASKED TO READ COPIES OF TWO PARK DECREES
PENALIZING CRITICISM OF SK CONSTITUTION AND BARRING

16.  FROM PANMUNJOM, SUN'S SEIDEN REPORTS THAT AMIDST
REMAINING HOSTILITY BETWEEN KOREAS, EACH YEAR ABOUT
20,000 TOURISTS -- MANY KOREAN WAR VETS -- COME
TO PEER ACROSS TENSE BORDER &quot;ON WHAT IS SURELY ONE
OF THE WORLD'S STRANGEST GUIDED TOURS.&quot;  TOUR USUALLY

COMMENT AND ANALYSIS

CHINA

17.  CHOU'S REDUCED ROLE IN VARIOUS STATE FUNCTIONS
PROMPTS JOURNALISTIC CHINA-WATCHERS IN HK TO
SPECULATE ON ITS MEANING.  CHOU'S FAILURE TO APPEAR
AT BANQUET GIVEN BY SENGHOR, GETTING EQUAL (RATHER
THAN TOP) BILLING WITH A DEPUTY PREMIER DURING MAO'S
MEETING WITH BHUTTO, PROMPTS S-N'S BRADSHER (MAY 13)
TO EXPRESS VIEW THAT CHOU'S &quot;ACTUAL IMPORTANCE IN
CHINA HAS FADED FAR FROM WHAT THE WORLD LONG KNEW AND
STILL IS INCLINED TO ASSUME.&quot;  SUN'S ED WU, ON OTHER
HAND, OBSERVES OFFICIAL MEDIA STILL GIVING CHOU,
EXECUTOR OF DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN POLICY, SAME GLOWING
TREATMENT HE HAS ALWAYS ENJOYED.  WU SEES CHOU'S
CURTAILED PARTICIPATION IN OFFICIAL ENGAGMENTS AS
NECESSITATED BY ADVANCING AGE, ADDING THAT FACTS HAVE
SHOWN THAT CHOU IS STILL FIRMLY IN CONTROL OF AFFAIRS
UNCLASSIFIED

PAGE 07  STATE  100216

OF STATE.

18.  NYT'S LELYVELD EXPRESSES UNCERTAINTY WHETHER CHOU'S
WITHDRAWALS FROM ACTIVE ROLE IN VARIOUS STATE FUNCTIONS
IS VOLUNTARY OR UNDER PRESSURE.  SAYS STRESS ON CHOU'S
AGE SUGGESTS THAT ABSENCES SIGNIFY MORE THAN TEMPORARY

INDISPOSITION.  NOTES THAT PHOTO TAKEN DURING BHUTTO'S
MEETING WITH MAO SHOWED WHAT APPEARED TO BE   SYMBOLIC
SHIFT IN RITUALISTIC SEATING ARRANGEMENT, WITH CHOU'S
INVARIABLE SEAT TO MAO'S RIGHT OCCUPIED BY TENG HSIAO-PING
CHOU SAT ON MAO'S LEFT, NEXT TO BHUTTO IN WHAT WAS STILL
A PLACE OF HONOR.  FACT THAT THIS LEFT CHOU SITTING
CLOSER TO MAO THAN WANG HUNG-WEN, THIRD RANKING
FIGURE IN CP HIERARCHY, INDICATES CHOU STILL RANKS
NO. 2.  AND WHEN CHOU CONFERRED WITH BHUTTO ON MAY
12, NCNA GAVE TENG EQUAL BILLING.  LELYVELD NOTES
ALSO THAT CHOU'S PLACE WAS TAKEN BY ANOTHER DEPUTY
PREMIER, LI HSIEN-NIEN, AT EARLIER FUNCTION HONORING
SENGHOR.  OBSERVES THAT CHANGE IN LEADERSHIP PATTERN
COMES IN MIDST OF ANTI-CONFUCIUS AND ANTI-LIN PIAO
CAMPAIGN WHICH SOME ANALYSTS BELIEVE IS DIRECTED
AGAINST CHOU; WHILE OTHERS HAVE MAINTAINED UNTIL
RECENTLY THAT CHOU WAS ACTUALLY DIRECTING CAMPAIGN.
SAYS WHETHER OR NOT CHOU IS EVER OPENLY ATTACKED,
SUDDEN WANING OF HIS STAMINA IS CLEAR INDICATION
THAT HE IS NOT PRIME FORCE BEHIND ANTI-CONFUCIUS
CAMPAIGN.

PRC PRESS TAKES PAINS TO INDICATE CHOU HAS NOT BEEN
DISGRACED; LATEST EXAMPLE WAS NCNA'S &quot;UNUSUAL&quot; DISPATCH
ON TEA BY HIS WIFE FOR SVN &quot;WOMEN'S UNION FOR LIBERA-
TION.&quot;

19.  OF CHOU'S REDUCED ACTIVITIES, WP'S GREENWAY
SAYS CHOU MIGHT WELL FEEL NEED TO SHARE SOME STATE
RESPONSIBILITIES REGARDLESS OF POLITICAL PRESSURES,
BUT NOTES THAT CURRENT POLITICAL CAMPAIGN SEEMS
MORE AND MORE A SERIOUS CHALLENGE TO HIS POLICIES
AS THE SHATTERED PARTY WHICH HE WORKED SO HARD TO
REBUILD AFTER THE GPCR AGAIN SHOWS SIGNS OF SEVERE
UNCLASSIFIED

PAGE 08  STATE  100216

DISUNITY AND STRESS.  ONE VIEW POPULAR IN WASHINGTON
FOR A WHILE WAS THAT THERE WAS NO SERIOUS POLITICAL
THREAT TO CHOU AND THAT CAMPAIGN WAS IN FACT CHOU
MOVING IN STRENGTH AGAINST RADICAL LEFT.  &quot;IT WAS
A COMFORTING VIEW GIVEN SECRETARY OF STATE HENRY
KISSINGER'S PERSONAL AND DIPLOMATIC INVESTMENT IN
CHOU.&quot;  BUT AS CAMPAIGN ROLLED ON, EVIDENCE MOUNTED
THAT THE LEFT, AND PERHAPS MAO'S WIFE, WAS USING
CAMPAIGN TO ENHANCE THEIR POSITION AND THAT CHOU
AND HIS MODERATES WERE FINDING IT DIFFICULT TO CONTINUE.
AS WESTERN CHINA-WATCHERS PORE OVER CHINESE PRESS
FOR HINTS OF CHANGE, CHINA'S AMERICA-WATCHERS MAY
WELL HAVE TAKEN RECENT RESTON COLUMN IN NYT AS INDICATIVE

OF CHANGE IN US ATTITUDE.  RESTON WROTE LAST MONTH
THAT ALTHOUGH CHOU REMAINED PM, HE SEEMED TO BE
LESS PROMINENT NOW THAN BEFORE.  ARTICLE SAID THAT
HAK WAS MUCH TOO SHREWD AND EXPERIENCED TO MAKE
POLICY WITH A MAN INSTEAD OF A COUNTRY AND THAT
ALTHOUGH HAK HAD BEEN IMPRESSED WITH CHOU, CHOU
SEEMED TO BE 'LOSING HIS INFLUENCE AND CHANGING
HIS TUNE.&quot;  TENG HSIAO-PING'S VISIT TO NY WAS, RESTON
ARTICLE SUGGESTED, MAINLY TO SEE HAK.  NOWADAYS,
SAYS RESTON, MESSAGES FROM MAO TO WASHINGTON COME
THROUGH &quot;DIFFERENT ENVOYS,&quot; NO LONGER THROUGH CHOU.
GREENWAY NOTES THAT CHOU IS A BORN SURVIVOR WHO
HAS TRIED TO KEEP THINGS TOGETHER BY JOINING MAO'S
POLITICAL MOVEMENTS IN TIME TO AVOID BEING OVERWHELMED.
AT SAME TIME, HE MAY FEEL DANGEROUSLY EXPOSED, REMEMBERING
FATE OF LIU SHAO-CHI AND LIN PIAO.  HENCE, ALTHOUGH
HIS NON-ATTENDANCE AT RECENT EVENTS WAS PROBABLY
BECAUSE OF ILLNESS AND FATIGUE, HE ALSO MAY FEEL
NEED TO INVOLVE MORE OF HIS COLLEAGUES IN THESE
EVENTS IN ORDER NOT TO FEEL EXPOSED AND OUT IN FRONT
DURING DIFFICULT TIMES.

20.  VICTOR ZORZA RETURNS TO CHINA DEBATE WITH CONCLUSION
THAT SOME PRC LEADERS BELIEVE CHINA MUST MOVE CLOSER
TO AND RELY ON US ECON AND POLITICAL SUPPORT IN
STRUGGLE AGAINST RUSSIA.  OTHERS BELIEVE THIS IS
ROAD TO CAPITALIST HELL, AND PRC MUST MODERATE ITS
UNCLASSIFIED

PAGE 09  STATE  100216

DISPUTE WITH USSR.  SAYS US INTELLIGENCE SHOWS THERE
HAS BEEN SURGE OF REQUESTS FROM FACTORY MANAGERS
FOR IMPORTS OF FOREIGN EQUIPMENT WHICH HAS ALARMED
PRC LEADERSHIP, WHICH KNOWS CHINA LACKS FUNDS TO
SATISFY REQUESTS.  US OFFICIALS ARGUE THAT PRC PROPAGANDA
CAMPAIGN IS THEREFORE DESIGNED TO DAMP DOWN IMPORT
DEMAND RATHER THAN STIMULATE HOSTILITY TO US.  BUT
IN PRESENT POWER STRUGGLE, DENUNCIATIONS OF REVISIONISTS,
SAYS ZORZA, ARE AIMED AT CHOU EN-LAI.  CITES RECENT
ARTICLE ATTACKING HU SHIH AS DRAWING IMPLIED PARALLELS
BETWEEN CAREERS OF BOTH MEN.  AND AMONG REVISIONISTS
UNDER ATTACK IS CHOU'S &quot;CLOSEST ASSOCIATE&quot; IN POLITBURO,
REFORMED REVISIONIST TENG HSIAO-P'ING.  TENG IS
PINPOINTED BY DESCRIPTION OF A BEGGAR FROM IMPERIALISTS
WHO &quot;TAKES PRIDE IN OWNING FOREIGN-MADE WALKING
STICKS&quot; (WP).

21.  UPI NAIROBI (STLPD MAY 12) REPORTS CHINESE
LABORERS AND ENGINEERS RACING AHEAD AT RECORD SPEED
TO COMPLETE 1100-MILE RAILROAD LINKING ZAMBIA'S

COPPERBELT WITH INDIAN OCEAN.  CITES TANZANIAN OFFICIALS
AT DAR ES SALAAM RAILHEAD AS HOPING LINE WILL BE
COMPLETED LATE THIS YEAR OR EARLY NEXT YEAR -WAY
AHEAD OF SCHEDULE.  WORK BEGAN ON NEARLY 500 MIL
DOL RAILROAD IN 1970 AND COMPLETION DATE WAS TO
BE 1976, USING UP TO 60,000 WORKERS AT TIMES.  WESTERN
DIPLOMATS WORRIED THAT PART OF THIS WORK FORCE WAS
INDEED AN ARMY - MEMBERS OF PLA, BUT TANZANIANS
AND ZAMBIANS SHRUG OFF SUCH SUGGESTIONS.  THEY ARE
GRATEFUL TO COUNTRY WHICH OFFERED TO FUND PROJECT
AT TIME WHEN WESTERN INSTITUTIONS CALLED IT UNFEASIBLE
AND REFUSED TO GRANT ANY LOANS.  BOTH COUNTRIES
WILL BEGIN TO REPAY INTEREST-FREE LOAN OVER 30-YEAR
PERIOD BEGINNING 1983.

CAMBODIA

22.  CDN'S LARRY GREEN (PHIL BULLETIN MAY 12) IN
KOMPONG THOM CONDUCTS RANDOM INTERVIEW AMONG REFUGEES
WHO FLED COMMUNIST-CONTROLLED AREAS.  CITES REFUGEE
UNCLASSIFIED

PAGE 10  STATE  100216

THAT THE &quot;KHMER ROUGE DID NOT TREAT US LIKE CAMBODIANS.
THE KHMER ROUGE SAID NO ONE COULD GET MARRIED BECAUSE
IT WAS BAD TO MAKE LOVE...WE COULD NOT RESPECT BUDDHISM...
THEY...MADE MONKS WORK...WE COULD NOT KEEP WHAT
WE GREW.  THEY COLLECTED EVERYTHING AND PUT IT IN
A COMMON STOCK.&quot;  ANOTHER SAID &quot;WE HAD NO LIBERTY.
THEY DIDN'T ALLOW FAMILIES TO LIVE TOGETHER...EVERYBODY
HAD TO WORK BUT THE SMALLEST CHILDREN.  THE OLD
MEN AND WOMEN TOOK CARE OF THEM.&quot;  GREEN REMARKS
THAT RIGID LIFE STYLE OF KHMER ROUGE IS APPARENTLY
ALIENATING CAMBODIANS ACCUSTOMED TO MINIMAL WORK
AND MAXIMUM LEISURE.

23.  IN DISPATCH FROM PP (ATLANTA CONSTITUTION MAY
9), GREEN REPORTS GROWING DIPLOMATIC CONCERN THAT
LON NOL GOVT WILL LOSE UN SEAT WHEN ITS CREDENTIALS
ARE CHALLENGED IN VOTE NEXT FALL.  NOTES THAT IN
EFFORT TO BOLSTER THEIR RESPECTIVE POSITIONS, GKR
AND GRUNK HAVE MOUNTED DIPLOMATIC OFFENSIVES.  WHILE
FM KEUKY LIM IS IN NY ATTEMPTING TO LINE UP VOTES,
KHIEU SAMPHAN, ALLEGEDLY ONE OF THREE COMMUNIST
REBELS SECRETLY EXECUTED BY SIHANOUK, TURNED UP
IN HANOI AND PEKING A FEW WEEKS BACK AND IS NOW
MAKING ROUNDS IN AFRICA.  SAMPHAN'S MOVE SEEN BY
DIPLOMATIC OBSERVERS AS DUAL ATTEMPT TO INCREASE
HIS INTERNATIONAL STATURE WHILE PROVING TO UN MEMBER
NATIONS THAT REBELS DO HAVE LEADERSHIP WITHIN CAMBODIA.
OTHER ANALYSTS SEE EMERGENCE OF SAMPHAN AS REBEL

ATTEMPT PUBLICLY TO UNDERMINE SIHANOUK.  INFORMED
DIPLOMATS SAY IF LON NOL GOVT WERE OUSTED FROM UN,
US SUPPORT FOR REGIME WOULD NOT BE AFFECTED.  HOWEVER,
SOURCES BELIEVE OUSTER WOULD AFFECT RELATIONS BETWEEN
GKR AND OTHER NATIONS WHICH NOW SUPPLY SMALL BUT
IMPORTANT AMOUNTS OF AID.  ANALYSTS ALSO BELIEVE
OUSTER OF GKR AND RECOGNITION OF REBELS WOULD COMPLICATE
EFFORTS TO NEGOTIATE SETTLEMENT, HARDENING INSURGENTS
AGAINST COMPROMISE.

VIETNAM

24.  FURGURSON (PHILA BULLETIN MAY 12) RECALLS THAT
8 YEARS AGO WHEN ENEMY USED 120MM MORTARS TO ATTACK
DA NANG, STORY MADE FRONT PAGE OF US PAPERS, BUT
WHEN IN PAST WEEK  ENEMY USED TANKS FOR FIRST TIME
IN THE DELTA, STORY MADE 4 PARAS ON PAGE 18 OF WASHINGTON
MORNING PAPER.  MOST US PAPERS TOOK NO NOTICE OF
EVENT.  SAYS DIFFERENCE IS THAT AMERICANS ARE NO
LONGER STATIONED IN VN AND IT IS WAR WE HAVE FORGOTTEN.
CITES SECDEF AS MAKING POINT THAT WHEN WE WITHDREW
FROM VN, &quot;WE ARE NOT TOLD BY THE SOUTH VIETNAMESE,
'GIVE US THE TOOLS AND WE WILL DO THE JOB.' INSTEAD
WE INFORMED THEM THAT WE WOULD GIVE THEM THE TOOLS
AND THE MUNITIONS AND THEY WERE EXPECTED TO DO THE
JOB.&quot;  FURGURSON COMMENTS THAT WE HAVE AN OBLIGATION
OF OUR OWN CREATION; THEY DEPEND ON IT IN GOOD FAITH
AS THEY FIGHT ON HARDLY NOTICED; &quot;TO HELP THEM IS A DEBT
OF HONOR.&quot;

THAILAND

25.  LAT'S FOISIE (PHINQ MAY 10) DOES FEATURE ON US-BUILT
THAI MILITARY PORT AT SATTAHIP - A PROJECT WHICH
COST MORE THAN 50 MIL DOLS.  WITH INDOCHINA WAR ENDED,
SATTAHIP SERVES MAINLY AS TRANSSHIPMENT POINT FOR MIL
AND RELIEF SUPPLIES TO CAMBODIAN FANK AND PRO-GKR
CIVILIANS.  CITES  HIGH-RANKING US ARMY OFFICER THAT
EXPENSIVE MEKONG TRANSSHIPMENT ROUTE (VIA VN) IS REQUIRED
BECAUSE OF INABILITY TO MOVE SUPPLIES THROUGH KOMPONG
SOM; ROADS AND RAILROAD LEADING FROM KOMPONG SOM TO
PP HAVE BEEN CUT BY KHMER INSURGENTS.  MORE THAN 20,000
TONS OF AID GOODS AND AMMO MOVED BY BARGE FROM SATTAHIP
VIA THE MEKONG IN APRIL; SAME AMOUNT IN MARCH.  DESPITE
HAZARDS OF RIVER, ONLY TWO BARGES DESTROYED BY ENEMY
FIRE SINCE RIVER-LIFT BEGAN, ACCORDING SOURCE.  ENTIRE
COST OF TUG AND BARGE OPERATION PAID BY USG, ALTHOUGH
WORK PERFORMED UNDER THAI CONTRACTOR AND VESSELS ALL
FLY FOREIGN FLAGS.  NO ESTIMATE OF &quot;DETOUR&quot; SEALIFT
COST AVAILABLE, BUT IT IS PART OF OVERALL US SUPPORT
OF LON NOL GOVT - AN AID PROGRAM COSTING ALMOST 2 MIL
DOLS DAILY.  STEVEDORING AND STORAGE JOBS KEEP 2,000
US SOLDIERS BUSY.  ARMY ALSO EMPLOYS 13,600 CAMBODIAN

JAPAN

26.  LAT'S JAMESON (MAY 10) IN TOKYO CITES FINMIN FUKUDA
AS SAYING AT MAY 9 JAPAN NATIONAL PRESS CLUB LUNCHEON
THAT JAPAN WOULD NEED 3 YEARS, &quot;IF LUCKY,&quot; AND PROBABLY
&quot;FOUR OR FIVE YEARS&quot; TO BRING ITS INTERNATIONAL PAYMENTS
BACK INTO BALANCE.  FUKUDA DECLINED TO PREDICT HOW
MUCH TRADE SURPLUS JAPAN WOULD NEED TO BALANCE ITS
OVERALL PAYMENTS AFTER SUFFERING 13 BIL DOLS DEFICIT
IN FY 73.  HE MAINTAINS THAT &quot;A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF
BLACK INK&quot; IN TRADE WILL BE NECESSARY TO COVER DEFICITS
CAUSED BY SUCH FACTORS AS TOURIST SPENDING, SHIPPING
FEES, AND LONG-TERM CAPITAL OUTFLOW.  BUT IF FIGURE
GETS TOO BIG, THAT WOULD CAUSE PROBLEMS AGAIN.  &quot;YOUR
COUNTRY,&quot; FUKUDA SAYS TO AMERICAN REPORTER, &quot;WOULD
BE AMONG THE FIRST TO START COMPLAINING AGAIN.&quot;
QUOTES FUKUDA AS DECLARING THAT INTERNATIONAL PAYMENTS
ISSUE IS EVEN MORE OF A PROBLEM FOR JAPAN THAN SKYROCKETING
PRICES.  HE SAYS THAT JAPAN WOULD BE ABLE TO PAY
AN ADDITIONAL BILL FOR HIGHER COSTS OF IMPORTED OIL
IN FY 74 OF 10  BIL DOLS ON THE HEELS OF ITS 13 BIL
PAYMENTS DEFICIT LAST YEAR AND STILL CUT ITS OVERALL
PAYMENTS DEFICIT TO ABOUT HALF, OR BETWEEN 6 AND
7 BIL.  POINTS OUT THAT INTERNATIONAL INFLATION WOULD
ALLOW JAPAN TO RAISE PRICES OF ITS EXPORTS TO COVER
THE GAP.  FUKUDA SAYS JAPAN'S PAYMENTS PROBLEM DICTATED
SLOW-DOWN IN JAPAN'S GROWTH RATE TO LEVEL OF OTHER
DEVELOPED COUNTRIES.

THROUGH.  MCCOMBS SAYS SVN'S CONCERN &quot;IS DIRECT AND
SIMPLE&quot;: HOW WILL PRESIDENT'S FATE AFFECT ALREADY-
TROUBLED SUPPLY OF US AID THAT SUSTAINS SVN MILITARY
FORCES AND COUNTRY'S ECONOMY?  SAYS THIEU ORDERED

TRAN KIM PHOUNG HOME FEW DAYS AFTER TRANSCRIPTS RELEASED
TO EXPLAIN THEIR IMPACT ON SVN AID PROSPECTS, AND
AMBASSADOR'S REPORT WAS BLEAK -- THERE IS GOOD CHANCE
PRES WILL BE IMPEACHED, AND THIS COUPLED WITH SORDID
IMPACT OF WHOLE WATERGATE AFFAIR, COULD CAUSE FURTHER
AID CUTS IN CONGRESS.  MCCOMBS REPORTS WIDELY-SHARED
VIEW IN SAIGON THAT WATERGATE ALREADY HAS RENDERED
NIXON IMPOTENT CHAMPION OF SAIGON'S CAUSE IN CONGRESS.

IN HK, DAVID GREENWAY REPORTS THAT MOST ASIAN OFFICIALS
HE ENCOUNTERS ARE LESS TROUBLED ABOUT PRESIDENT'S
THREATENED OUSTER THAN THEY WERE NEARLY   YEAR AGO,
BECAUSE THEY NOW BELIEVE HAK WILL CONTINUE IN OFFICE
AND FOREIGN POLICY WILL BE BASICALLY UNCHANGED.

OBERDORFER, IN TOKYO, REPORTS THAT SENIOR GAIMUSHO
