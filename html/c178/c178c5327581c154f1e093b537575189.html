		<h3>Tor</h3>
		<p><a href="https://www.torproject.org">Tor</a> is an encrypted anonymising network that makes it harder to intercept internet communications, or see where communications are coming from or going to.</p>
		<p>In order to use the WikiLeaks public submission system as detailed above you can download the Tor Browser Bundle, which is a Firefox-like browser available for Windows, Mac OS X and GNU/Linux and pre-configured to connect using the anonymising system Tor.</p>
		<h4>Tails</h4>
		<p>If you are at high risk and you have the capacity to do so, you can also access the submission system through a secure operating system called <a href="https://tails.boum.org">Tails</a>. Tails is an operating system launched from a USB stick or a DVD that aim to leaves no traces when the computer is shut down after use and automatically routes your internet traffic through Tor. Tails will require you to have either a USB stick or a DVD at least 4GB big and a laptop or desktop computer.</p>

		<h3>Tips</h3>
		<p>Our submission system works hard to preserve your anonymity, but we recommend you also take some of your own precautions. Please review these basic guidelines. </p>
		<div>
			<h4>1. Contact us if you have specific problems</h4>
			<p>If you have a very large submission, or a submission with a complex format, or are a high-risk source, please <a href="#submit_help_contact">contact us</a>. In our experience it is always possible to find a custom solution for even the most seemingly difficult situations.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h4>2. What computer to use</h4>
			<p>If the computer you are uploading from could subsequently be audited in an investigation, consider using a computer that is not easily tied to you. Technical users can also use <a href="https://tails.boum.org">Tails</a> to help ensure you do not leave any records of your submission on the computer.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h4>3. Do not talk about your submission to others</h4>
			<p>If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in source protection – it is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This includes other media organisations.</p>
		</div>

	</div>
</div>

<div id="submit_help_after" class="submit_elem">

			</div>
		</div>

		<h3>After</h3>

		<div>
			<h4>1. Do not talk about your submission to others</h4>
			<p>If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in source protection – it is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This includes other media organisations.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h4>2. Act normal</h4>
			<p>If you are a high-risk source, avoid saying anything or doing anything after submitting which might promote suspicion. In particular, you should try to stick to your normal routine and behaviour.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h4>3. Remove traces of your submission</h4>
			<p>If you are a high-risk source and the computer you prepared your submission on, or uploaded it from, could subsequently be audited in an investigation, we recommend that you format and dispose of the computer hard drive and any other storage media you used.</p>
			<p>In particular, hard drives retain data after formatting which may be visible to a digital forensics team and flash media (USB sticks, memory cards and SSD drives) retain data even after a secure erasure. If you used flash media to store sensitive data, it is important to destroy the media.</p>
			<p>If you do this and are a high-risk source you should make sure there are no traces of the clean-up, since such traces themselves may draw suspicion.</p>
			<div>
				<h4>4. If you face legal action</h4>
				<p>If a legal action is brought against you as a result of your submission, there are organisations that may help you. The Courage Foundation is an international organisation dedicated to the protection of journalistic sources. You can find more details at <a href="https://www.couragefound.org">https://www.couragefound.org</a>.</p>

		<p>WikiLeaks publishes documents of political or historical importance that are censored or otherwise suppressed. We specialise in strategic global publishing and large archives.</p>
		<p>The following is the address of our secure site where you can anonymously upload your documents to WikiLeaks editors. You can only access this submissions system through Tor. (See our <a href="#submit_help_tor">Tor tab</a> for more information.) We also advise you to read our <a href="#submit_help_tips">tips for sources</a> before submitting.</p>

<br />
   Ok, obviously too much to rep here, the points that need coverage are:<br />
   The letter is released (try and put in some how that it is a few days<br />
   before the PArty Plenum)<br />
   The signatories that have been highlighted<br />
   The anger at censoring Wen's comments in Shenzhen, on GPS and at the UN<br />
   Fit in anything else you can, please, as this is a pretty important issue.<br />
   There is a building pressure for reform in China that comes at a time of<br />
   generational change and economic uncertainty that generally means greater<br />
   restrictions on information [chris]<br />

A group of former high-ranking political and cultural officials published a rare, strongly worded open letter to the top legislature calling<br />
mainland media censorship unconstitutional and saying it should be abolished.<br />
                                                          <br />
They also demanded that media products and books from Hong Kong and Macau - popular among mainland readers - be made openly available on mainland<br />
newsstands and in bookstores.                             <br />
                                                          <br />
The letter, published online, calls the lack of free speech, which is enshrined in the 1982 constitution, a &quot;scandal of the world history of<br />
democracy&quot;. It even cites Hong Kong in the colonial era as an example of somewhere that enjoyed freedom of speech and publication.<br />
                                                          <br />
In particular, the group of 23 well-known individuals condemned the Communist Party's central propaganda department as the &quot;black hand&quot; with a<br />
clandestine power to censor even Premier Wen Jiabao's repeated calls for political reform and to deprive the people their right to learn about it.<br />
                                                          <br />
For the last few weeks, well-connected professionals in Beijing have been talking about the party propaganda authorities' almost open insult to<br />
the premier by deleting his points on political reform the day after he made his speech in Shenzhen.<br />
                                                          <br />
Open letters of this kind rarely lead to any reform, but can land the authors in trouble with the authorities. However, in this case, the high<br />
profile of the signatories means they are unlikely to be punished.<br />
                                                          <br />
The open letter coincided with the imprisoned dissident Liu Xiaobo's winning of the Nobel Peace Prize on Friday. But several initiators of it said<br />
the two events were unrelated; rather, the open letter had been initiated earlier than the announcement of the Nobel Peace Prize and was directly<br />
triggered by the injustice to Xie Chaoping , an investigative reporter.<br />
                                                          <br />
In mid-August, Xie was taken from his home in Beijing by police from Shaanxi province, 1,000 kilometres away, under the charge of &quot;illegal<br />
business operation&quot;. But Xie and his supporters believe the actual reason was the book that he had published about forced migration to make way<br />
for a water project and related official corruption. Xie was released after 30 days' detention for lack of evidence but still has to spend the<br />
next year &quot;waiting for trial&quot;.                            <br />
                                                          <br />
Among the leading sponsors are Li Rui , former secretary of Mao Zedong who was sacked after disagreeing with Mao's disastrous economic programme;<br />
and Hu Jiwei, former publisher of the party's mouthpiece the People's Daily, who was removed for trying to reflect the people's voices. Both men<br />
are in their 90s. Li confirmed that he had put his name on the open letter.<br />
                                                          <br />
Zhong Peizhang , former news bureau chief of the Central Propaganda Department and another sponsor of the letter, said the petition was to fight<br />
for the rights of expression. He said the current press environment was unsatisfactory.<br />
                                                          <br />
Author Tie Liu , another sponsor, said Xie Chaoping's case was a brilliant opportunity that the sponsors should grab. &quot;These veteran media<br />
professionals have not been able to speak their minds for so long that they all felt bottled up and frustrated,&quot; Tie said. &quot;The situation the<br />
press is in must change.&quot;                                 <br />
                                                          <br />
&quot;The press environment has deteriorated in recent decades,&quot; said Tie, citing in the letter the example of Li Rui's article, which could be<br />
published in 1981 but was just recently censored from a book. &quot;As the radio, TV, print media and the internet are all tightly controlled, people<br />
nowadays have no channels to file their petitions but sometimes have to turn to foreigners. This could lead to chaos and public disturbance.&quot;<br />
                                                          <br />
He said he had received more than 500 signatures from people aged from their early 20s to 97. &quot;All petition signatories used their real names, and<br />
90 per cent of them are party members,&quot; Tie said.         <br />
                                                          <br />
Sha Yexin , author and former president of Shanghai People's Art Theatre, said freedoms of the press and expression were better for the party's<br />
governing in the long run if they were ensured. &quot;Freedom of the press actually serves as a decompressor,&quot; Sha said, adding that the suppression of<br />
information and a totalitarian society were behind disasters such as the Cultural Revolution and the anti-rightist campaign.<br />
                                                          <br />
Dai Qing , an author and activist, said even if there was a 0.001 per cent chance the petition would lead to change then it must be done.<br />
                                                          <br />
The open letter begins by citing article 35 of the Chinese Constitution (the 1982 edition) that all citizens have freedoms of speech, of<br />
publication, of assembly, of association and of demonstration. But it points out that for 28 years these constitutional rights have existed only<br />
in words but never really in practice.                    <br />
                                                          <br />
Citing words by President Hu Jintao and Wen in support of freedom of speech, the open letter says the reality in today's China is worse than that<br />
of the former British colony of Hong Kong, where mainlanders can find many books on Chinese politics they can't find at home.<br />
                                                          <br />
Sponsors of the open letter seemed most outraged by the fact that even Wen had been censored. They cited examples of his speech in Shenzhen on<br />
August 21, a talk with journalists in the US on September 22 and his speech to the United Nations General Assembly on September 23.<br />
                                                          <br />
Wen talked about political reform on all those occasions, but it was not mentioned in reports by Xinhua.<br />
                                                          <br />
&quot;What right does the Central Propaganda Department have,&quot; the open letter asked, &quot;to place itself even above the Communist Party Central<br />
Committee, and above the State Council?&quot; Wen, as premier, heads the State Council - the executive branch of the state elected by the National<br />
People's Congress.                                        <br />
                                                          <br />
The letter calls on the NPC to enact a new law of news and publication to replace &quot;the countless rules and regulations&quot; that hamper freedoms of<br />
speech and publication.                                   <br />
                                                          <br />
Most importantly, it says the media should gain its &quot;relative independence&quot; from direct control by the party or state apparatus. It notes that the<br />
mainland's censorship system lags behind Britain by 315 years and France by 129 years.<br />

2. Respect journalists and their due social status. Protection and support should be rendered to them when they are covering mass actions and<br />
exposing official corruption.                             <br />
                                                          <br />
3. Revoke the ban on cross-provincial supervision by public opinion.<br />
                                                          <br />
4. No Web administrator should be allowed to delete any items or post any of their own items at will, except for cases where the state information<br />
or citizens' privacy is truly affected. Abolish cyber-police and the &quot;50-cent army&quot; [paid favourable commentators].<br />
                                                                          <br />
5. Guarantee to all citizens the right to know the crimes and mistakes committed by the political party in power; there should be no areas in the<br />
Communist Party's history where recording and debate are forbidden.       <br />
                                                                          <br />
6. Launch pilot projects, preferably in the magazines Southern Weekend and Yan Huang Chun Qiu, in the reform of developing media organisations<br />
owned by citizens. A democratic political system should not tolerate the party in power and the government squandering taxpayers' money on<br />
self-congratulation.                                                      <br />
                                                                          <br />
7. Allow media and publications from Hong Kong and Macau to be openly distributed.<br />
                                                                          <br />
8. Change the mission of propaganda authorities at all levels, from preventing the leak of information, to facilitating its accurate, timely and<br />
smooth spread; from assisting corrupt officials to censor investigative and critical articles, to supporting the media's supervision of the<br />
Communist Party and the government; from closing down publications, sacking editors-in-chief, and arresting journalists, to resisting political<br />
privilege and protecting media and journalists.                           <br />

<br />
   BEIJING (AFP) a** A group of former top communist officials<br />
   and media leaders has issued an open letter to China's government calling<br />
   for political reform, but authorities have attempted to suppress the<br />
   appeal.<br />
<br />
   The bluntly-worded letter focused on the lack of freedom of expression and<br />
   comes as the Communist Party readies for a pivotal meeting later this week<br />
   expected to give hints on the country's future political direction.<br />
<br />
   &quot;If the Communist Party does not reform itself, does not transform, it<br />
   will lose its vitality and die a natural death,&quot; said the letter which was<br />
   posted on the Internet.<br />
<br />
   The letter has since been deleted from chatrooms on major portals,<br />
   apparently by government censors, but was still popping up in some more<br />
   obscure chat rooms.<br />
<br />
   It pointedly called for the government to give editors and journalists the<br />
   freedom to report without restrictions and to end a system in which media<br />
   and book content must be reviewed by censors before it is published.<br />
<br />
   It also called for an end to the &quot;arbitrary&quot; deleting of web content by<br />
   censors. China's government operates a vast censorship system that blocks<br />
   material deemed a threat to the primacy of the Communist Party.<br />
<br />
   &quot;China's citizens have the right to know the ruling party's sins,&quot; the<br />
   letter said.<br />
<br />
   It was signed by 23 people including Li Rui, former personal secretary<br />
   to Mao Zedong and former deputy head of a powerful department within the<br />
   party, and Hu Jiwei, a former editor of the People?s Daily, the party's<br />
   mouthpiece.<br />
<br />
   Several other signatories are known for their reformist sympathies.<br />
<br />
   China's restrictions on freedom of expression have come under renewed<br />
   scrutiny after dissident political reform advocate Liu Xiaobo, jailed in<br />
   December for 11 years on subversion charges, won the Nobel Peace Prize<br />
   Friday.<br />
<br />
   Speculation about turmoil within the party's ranks also has heightened<br />
   after Premier Wen Jiabao, widely viewed as a less-hardline voice in the<br />
   party, made remarks in August supporting political reform.<br />
<br />
   He made similar remarks in a CNN television interview that was aired<br />
   earlier this month but was blocked in China.<br />
<br />
   The party holds its annual four-day plenum starting Friday, with<br />
   speculation mounting over whether some type of reform would be on the<br />
   agenda.<br />

   By Bloomberg News<br />
<br />
   Oct. 13 (Bloomberg) -- A group of retired Communist Party officials are<br />
   calling for more press freedom in China days before the party holds an<br />
   annual meeting in Beijing.<br />
<br />
   Li Rui, a former secretary to the late Chairman Mao Zedong, Hu Jiwei, the<br />
   former editor of the Communist Partya**s mouthpiece, Peoplea**s Daily, and<br />
   other elders released an open letter to the countrya**s legislature<br />
   calling for the party to respect the countrya**s constitutional guarantee<br />
   of free speech. The group said that comments by Premier Wen<br />
   Jiabao expressing support for more political openness in China have been<br />
   censored in China by the partya**s propaganda department.<br />
<br />
   a**When our country was founded in 1949, our people cried that they had<br />
   been liberated, that they were now their own masters,a** the letter said.<br />
   a**But even today, 61 years after the founding of our nation, after 30<br />
   years of opening and reform, we have not yet attained freedom of speech<br />
   and freedom of the press to the degree enjoyed by the people of Hong Kong<br />
   under colonial rule.a**<br />
<br />
   The unusual release of such a letter comes two days before the Communist<br />
   Partya**s central committee meets in Beijing for an annual meeting that<br />
   will set policy and promote future party and government leaders. The<br />
   elders do not have influence a**but they do have connections,a** and the<br />
   letter reflects a debate within the party over moving ahead with political<br />
   reform, said Huang Jing, a visiting professor at the National University<br />
   of Singaporea**s Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy.<br />
<br />
   The open publication is a a**desperate last efforta** by the elders after<br />
   a move for political reform was undermined by awarding of the Nobel Peace<br />
   Prize to imprisoned Chinese democracy activist Liu Xiaobo, Huang said.<br />
<br />
   a**Look Bada**<br />
<br />
   Liua**s award was viewed in the party as a**a deliberate move to make the<br />
   Chinese government look bada** and this besieged mentality has emboldened<br />
   opponents of political reform, Huang said.<br />
<br />
   The letter blamed a**invisible lack handsa** for squelching Wena**s<br />
   comments domestically, including an August speech in the southern city of<br />
   Shenzhen in which he called for more political openness. Wena**s comments<br />
   on a future China with more freedom during a Cable News Network interview<br />
   last month were not mentioned in domestic accounts, the letter said.<br />
<br />
   a**I believe I and all the Chinese people have such a conviction that<br />
   China will make continuous progress, and the peoplea**s wishes for and<br />
   needs for democracy and freedom are irresistible,a** Wen said on CNNa**s<br />
   a**Fareed Zakaria GPSa** program taped Sept. 23 in New York. a**I hope<br />
   that you will be able to gradually see the continuous progress of<br />
   China.a**<br />
<br />
   a**What Right?a**<br />
<br />
   Instructions to censor comments in the domestic media are made by<br />
   anonymous officials from the partya**s Central Propaganda Department,<br />
   which is assuming a role senior to the State Council, the highest<br />
   authority in the nation, the letter said.<br />
<br />
   a**What right does the Central Propaganda Department have to muzzle the<br />
   speech of the Premier?a** the letter said. a**What right does it have to<br />
   rob the people of our nation of their right to know what the Premier<br />
   said?a**<br />
<br />
   Freedom of expression has deteriorated in recent years, author Tie Liu,<br />
   one of the lettera**s signatories, told Hong Konga**s South China Morning<br />
   Post. People in China often have to turn to Hong Kong to publish items<br />
   discussing social and political affairs.<br />
<br />
   a**For our nation to advertise itself as having a**socialist democracya**<br />
   with Chinese characteristics is such an embarrassment,a** the letter said.<br />
<br />
   The Communist Party Central Committee plenum will be held Oct. 15-18 in<br />
   Beijing.<br />
