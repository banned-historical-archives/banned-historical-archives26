		<h3>Tor</h3>
		<p><a href="https://www.torproject.org">Tor</a> is an encrypted anonymising network that makes it harder to intercept internet communications, or see where communications are coming from or going to.</p>
		<p>In order to use the WikiLeaks public submission system as detailed above you can download the Tor Browser Bundle, which is a Firefox-like browser available for Windows, Mac OS X and GNU/Linux and pre-configured to connect using the anonymising system Tor.</p>
		<h4>Tails</h4>
		<p>If you are at high risk and you have the capacity to do so, you can also access the submission system through a secure operating system called <a href="https://tails.boum.org">Tails</a>. Tails is an operating system launched from a USB stick or a DVD that aim to leaves no traces when the computer is shut down after use and automatically routes your internet traffic through Tor. Tails will require you to have either a USB stick or a DVD at least 4GB big and a laptop or desktop computer.</p>

		<h3>Tips</h3>
		<p>Our submission system works hard to preserve your anonymity, but we recommend you also take some of your own precautions. Please review these basic guidelines. </p>
		<div>
			<h4>1. Contact us if you have specific problems</h4>
			<p>If you have a very large submission, or a submission with a complex format, or are a high-risk source, please <a href="#submit_help_contact">contact us</a>. In our experience it is always possible to find a custom solution for even the most seemingly difficult situations.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h4>2. What computer to use</h4>
			<p>If the computer you are uploading from could subsequently be audited in an investigation, consider using a computer that is not easily tied to you. Technical users can also use <a href="https://tails.boum.org">Tails</a> to help ensure you do not leave any records of your submission on the computer.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h4>3. Do not talk about your submission to others</h4>
			<p>If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in source protection – it is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This includes other media organisations.</p>
		</div>

	</div>
</div>

<div id="submit_help_after" class="submit_elem">

			</div>
		</div>

		<h3>After</h3>

		<div>
			<h4>1. Do not talk about your submission to others</h4>
			<p>If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in source protection – it is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This includes other media organisations.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h4>2. Act normal</h4>
			<p>If you are a high-risk source, avoid saying anything or doing anything after submitting which might promote suspicion. In particular, you should try to stick to your normal routine and behaviour.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h4>3. Remove traces of your submission</h4>
			<p>If you are a high-risk source and the computer you prepared your submission on, or uploaded it from, could subsequently be audited in an investigation, we recommend that you format and dispose of the computer hard drive and any other storage media you used.</p>
			<p>In particular, hard drives retain data after formatting which may be visible to a digital forensics team and flash media (USB sticks, memory cards and SSD drives) retain data even after a secure erasure. If you used flash media to store sensitive data, it is important to destroy the media.</p>
			<p>If you do this and are a high-risk source you should make sure there are no traces of the clean-up, since such traces themselves may draw suspicion.</p>
			<div>
				<h4>4. If you face legal action</h4>
				<p>If a legal action is brought against you as a result of your submission, there are organisations that may help you. The Courage Foundation is an international organisation dedicated to the protection of journalistic sources. You can find more details at <a href="https://www.couragefound.org">https://www.couragefound.org</a>.</p>

		<p>WikiLeaks publishes documents of political or historical importance that are censored or otherwise suppressed. We specialise in strategic global publishing and large archives.</p>
		<p>The following is the address of our secure site where you can anonymously upload your documents to WikiLeaks editors. You can only access this submissions system through Tor. (See our <a href="#submit_help_tor">Tor tab</a> for more information.) We also advise you to read our <a href="#submit_help_tips">tips for sources</a> before submitting.</p>

   Maybe in expanding the Korea/Taiwan section you can combine some of the<br />
   bulky &quot;Falling Consumption&quot; section. Either way, the piece is very nice.<br />
   The section on regions makes me want to know more about each, great<br />
   opportunity to use the interactive to tell us that story.<br />

   American assistance is indeed something we've discussed but decided<br />
   against in consideration of length. I think you are right that something<br />
   needs said about it <br />

     Not sure it needs to be this long for what it is saying, especially when<br />
     telling the story of China itself in the &quot;Falling Consumption&quot; part.<br />
     That part seems to be stuffed with info. I'd actually maybe like to see<br />
     more on the front end, telling us the story of Taiwan and Korea.<br />
<br />
     Question that should be posed is to what extent did the consumer market<br />
     of the U.S., willing to make allowances to geopolitical allies Korea and<br />
     Taiwan and purchase their exceedingly more and more high tech exports,<br />
     play a role in their conversion. Would we make the same exception for<br />
     China? I guess if we're buying their fridges and toaster ovens, we'd buy<br />
     their cars as well. But it's something I have in the back of my mind...<br />
     Korea, taiwan and Japan all succeeded in moving up the tech tree as US<br />
     super-friends, would China?<br />

       EAST ASIA MODEL<br />
<br />
       At the root of the East Asian a**Miraclea** model is the need to<br />
       maintain employment for massive populations is that really the source<br />
       of the Miracle? isn't that the root benefit. The root of the model is<br />
       export led growth, no?. East Asian states in general have high<br />
       population density and histories of labor intensive agriculture.<br />
       Governments that do not provide stable employment conditions end up<br />
       with  a large and unhappy population on their hands, frequently the<br />
       cause of revolutions. In a modern industrial context, Asian economies<br />
       have therefore focused on labor-intensive industry, they started off<br />
       with labor-intensive industries, I would say that the problem becomes<br />
       when they move on to specialized exports that don't really need that<br />
       much labor... which they expand continually by means of<br />
       government-controlled financial systems that redirect bank deposits<br />
       into credit extension to expand infrastructure and industrial<br />
       capacity. Cheap credit enables businesses to maximize output and seize<br />
       greater market share internationally, bringing in more cash to<br />
       continue the cycle.<br />
<br />
       The Chinese a**economic miraclea** a** like the East Asian miracle<br />
       before it -- is made possible by just such a channeling of massive<br />
       household and corporate savings into fixed capital investment to build<br />
       the roads, factories, trains, and buildings necessary to modernize and<br />
       expand economic activity.<br />
<br />
       But a serious defect of this model is that it discourages the<br />
       development of household consumption as a third pillar of growth.<br />
       Families are encouraged to save (which helps the government fund<br />
       policies that assist the national economy -- for symetry sake with<br />
       your other bracket) rather than spend (which would assist the local<br />
       economy), depressing domestic consumption. Increasing investment in<br />
       recessionary periods means building more production capacity despite<br />
       weak demand  (domestically or abroad). At a certain point East Asian<br />
       states have tended to undergo transitions in which policies were<br />
       adjusted to stabilize or boost domestic consumption while allowing<br />
       fixed investment to taper off. The result a** if restructuring is<br />
       successful a** is a more balanced economy in which consumption<br />
       sustains the economy, while varying degrees of exports and investment<br />
       contribute to growth.<br />
<br />
       Both Taiwan and South Korea went through this process. In Taiwan,<br />
       rapid growth between 1962 and 1985 in exports, savings and investment<br />
       was accompanied by falling consumption growth. Taiwana**s exchange<br />
       rate deprecation in the late 1970s facilitated a rapid rise in exports<br />
       causing exports to outstrip domestic consumption as a share of GDP.<br />
       However, after 1983, Taiwan began to implement financial<br />
       liberalization as part of its transition to a high-tech economy,<br />
       including relaxation of capital controls. what was the logic for this?<br />
       they needed more investments to make teh leap to more high tech<br />
       exports? Give one sentence of context  This economic transition<br />
       facilitated a rise in consumption back to its 1968 level of 60 percent<br />
       of GDP. Today Taiwana**s maintains a balance of consumption (60<br />
       percent of GDP), exports (67 percent of GDP)   and investment (19<br />
       percent of GDP) [see Chart]. A small island with limited room for<br />
       heavy industry, capital formation in Taiwan never rose above 30<br />
       percent of GDP. Not sure what that means, can you explain.<br />
<br />
       South Korea similarly saw rapid growth in exports, savings and fixed<br />
       investment after the 1960s, reaching the peak of fixed investment in<br />
       the years leading up to and immediately following the Seoul Olympics<br />
       of 1988. While geographically small, South Korea required large fixed<br />
       investment to support the expansion of heavy industry by Cheobol --<br />
       state supported corporate conglomerates. Naturally consumption fell as<br />
       a portion of GDP until 1988 when it reached a low of 51 percent. After<br />
       this period currency appreciation (which increased domestic buying<br />
       power) enabled consumption to remain stable, while the resulting drop<br />
       in exports was offset by an increase in investment. Even after the<br />
       1997 Asian financial crisis, when consumption dropped to its lowest<br />
       point amid domestic financial troubles and recession, South Korea was<br />
       able to recover rapidly on the back of a policy supported domestic<br />
       consumption boom from 1998-2002. Today Korea balances consumption (55<br />
       percent of GDP) with exports (53 percent of GDP) -- investment takes<br />
       up a smaller portion at about 30 percent of GDP. This paragraph seemed<br />
       to flow better than the top one.<br />
<br />
       China, however, has not yet undergone this transition to consumer-led<br />
       growth, and remains heavily dependent on exports and investments.<br />
       While in Taiwan and Korea consumption only once fell below half of GDP<br />
       (and quickly recovered), in China consumption fell below half of GDP<br />
       in 1990 and, especially since 2000, has continued to fall, hitting a<br />
       low point of 35 percent of GDP in 2008. Savings, fixed investment and<br />
       especially exports have risen substantially during this time. In other<br />
       words, unlike other Asian economies, China has not succeeded in<br />
       transitioning its economy and shoring up consumption, thus leaving it<br />
       extremely vulnerable to global slowdowns that affect trade. In fact<br />
       during the 2009 global recession, a surge in investment from<br />
       government stimulus accounted for over 90 percent of growth.<br />
<br />
       It is not a coincidence that in both South Korea and Taiwan, the shift<br />
       from state-guided investment to consumption driven economies occurred<br />
       in tandem with democratization process. More private control over<br />
       wealth generated more popular demand for control over other things,<br />
       like political representation and governance. In China, the Communist<br />
       Party is resolutely opposed to popular style governments that could<br />
       challenge its regime, and this has perhaps played a part in the<br />
       government's reluctance to unleash consumer forces to transform the<br />
       economy. I don't really buy this... especially not if you add the<br />
       &quot;perhaps&quot; qualifier. Isn't China encouraging consumption? Isn't it<br />
       practically throwing consumer products at people (like fridges, etc.)?<br />
       If I was a reader, I would want this paragraph explained...<br />
<br />
       FALLING CONSUMPTION<br />
<br />
       The trend of consumption falling as a share of China's economic growth<br />
       was not inevitable. In the first decade of economic reforms China<br />
       experienced relatively balanced economic growth. Economic opening in<br />
       1978 unleashed 30 years of pent up consumption as households,<br />
       entrepreneurs and farmers gained the freedom to buy and sell.<br />
       Consumption stayed at 50% of GDP throughout the 1980s, while exports<br />
       and fixed investment expanded at a gradual rate averaging 25% and 18%<br />
       growth per year. However, by the late 1980s consumption growth became<br />
       unstable, as rapid inflation and political unrest forced the<br />
       government to re-centralize economic policy and cool down the economy.<br />
<br />
       Consumption growth has never contributed as much to the economy as it<br />
       did in the 1980s, though it enjoyed a period of relative stability<br />
       from 1994-2000. In 1992, Deng Xiaoping launched a growth strategy<br />
       focused on coastal cities. Initially, the booming export economy and<br />
       investment led to a rapid rise in private employment in the export<br />
       sector, stabilizing the decline in consumption growth. But this growth<br />
       proved unsustainable. By the late 1990s, coastal cities and<br />
       state-owned enterprises were flooded with capital and the domestic<br />
       banking system was at risk due to rising non-performing loans and<br />
       overheating in the real-estate sector [LINKS]. The government blamed<br />
       inefficient management in SOEs for economic problems, and launched<br />
       major reforms that caused rising unemployment and a breakdown of the<br />
       a**iron rice bowl&quot; -- the welfare system for masses of state<br />
       employees. Since Premier Zhu Rongji initiated the process of<br />
       downsizing the state-sector in 1995, 48 million jobs have been lost<br />
       and the state-sector contracted by 3% per year. Afterwards Chinese<br />
       consumption fell more dramatically than ever before as a share of GDP.<br />
<br />
       In the last decade the Chinese economy has been driven primarily by<br />
       fixed investment (44 percent of GDP in 2008) and exports (32 percent<br />
       of GDP) at the expense of domestic consumption (35 percent of GDP).<br />
       Employment and wage growth have lagged behind rising costs for<br />
       education, housing, health care, and basic goods, leading to the rise<br />
       in savings. And with few investment opportunities, most families<br />
       deposit their savings in the state-run banking system, which converts<br />
       the funds into government-planned investment. Meanwhile, consumers and<br />
       small and medium sized businesses have trouble obtaining credit, and<br />
       must rely on their earnings for self-financing, thus perpetuating the<br />
       cycle. Ok, so no encouragement of consumption?<br />
<br />
       Limited capital for entrepreneurs and small-medium sized enterprises<br />
       has made China dependent on the export-sector for employment. Over the<br />
       last two decades, state-sector downsizing and a shrinking agricultural<br />
       sector has put pressure on the Chinese government to create jobs. The<br />
       relaxation of agricultural trade barriers leading up to China's WTO<br />
       accession caused rural jobs to fall as a proportion of Chinaa**s<br />
       labour force from 73 percent in 1990 to 61 percent in 2007, creating a<br />
       contingent of at least 150 million migrant workers that migrate<br />
       between rural and urban areas providing low wage labour. Export<br />
       oriented private and foreign enterprises have soaked up the labor.<br />
       China's economy increasingly achieves growth through foreign consumer<br />
       demand rather than its own.<br />
<br />
       CHINA'S REGIONS<br />
<br />
       China's increasing dependency on exports and investment, and the<br />
       accompanying debilitation of consumption, has fed into regional<br />
       disparities. Looking at China's provinces through the lens of these<br />
       components of economic growth, four major  classes  can be identified:<br />
       those provinces that are the most heavily dependent on exports, those<br />
       that are most heavily dependent on investment, those that show<br />
       relative balance, and finally those with limited exports and<br />
       investment.<br />
<br />
       The first category (red on map) consists of export-dependent regions,<br />
       where exports take a greater share of regional GDP than consumption. I<br />
       am wondering if doing simple shares of regional GDP is the best way to<br />
       represent this. Consumption may be robust in these regions, it's just<br />
       that their exports are much bigger share of money generated. The<br />
       reasons for this may be multiple, starting for example with the fact<br />
       that salaries are not large enough to support the kind of consumption<br />
       taht would -- for these regions -- make a big difference.  These are<br />
       the wealthy, cosmopolitan coastal provinces and municipalities,<br />
       including Beijing, Tianjin, the Greater Shanghai region and Guangdong<br />
       Province. When Western countries speak of &quot;China,&quot; they refer to these<br />
       vibrant manufacturing hubs. Xinjiang, the autonomous region in the far<br />
       northwest, home to the ethnic Uighurs, is a newcomer to this category<br />
       due to a recent push by Beijing to deepen economic links to Kazakhstan<br />
       and the one non-coastal province in the category -- it remains the<br />
       gateway to Central Asia and has benefited from exports. But the wealth<br />
       is deceptive and these are in reality Chinaa**s most vulnerable<br />
       regions. Not only are these economies extremely dependent upon<br />
       international markets, but investment has surpassed what local<br />
       consumption there is, making them uniquely vulnerable to factors well<br />
       beyond their control.<br />
<br />
       Second (yellow) comes the investment-heavy regions, where fixed<br />
       investment is vastly more important than consumption. Manchuria, the<br />
       &quot;Rust Belt&quot; or old industrial heartland, lies in this category -- a<br />
       region kept alive by government subsidies and transfers. Sparsely<br />
       populated buffer regions, like Inner Mongolia in the north and Tibet<br />
       in the west, serve as geopolitical buffers giving China strategic<br />
       depth, and provide natural resources, but otherwise have no economies<br />
       to speak of. High fixed investment results<br />
<br />
