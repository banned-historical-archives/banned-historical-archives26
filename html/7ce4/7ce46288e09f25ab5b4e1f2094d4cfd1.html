		<h3>Tor</h3>
		<p><a href="https://www.torproject.org">Tor</a> is an encrypted anonymising network that makes it harder to intercept internet communications, or see where communications are coming from or going to.</p>
		<p>In order to use the WikiLeaks public submission system as detailed above you can download the Tor Browser Bundle, which is a Firefox-like browser available for Windows, Mac OS X and GNU/Linux and pre-configured to connect using the anonymising system Tor.</p>
		<h4>Tails</h4>
		<p>If you are at high risk and you have the capacity to do so, you can also access the submission system through a secure operating system called <a href="https://tails.boum.org">Tails</a>. Tails is an operating system launched from a USB stick or a DVD that aim to leaves no traces when the computer is shut down after use and automatically routes your internet traffic through Tor. Tails will require you to have either a USB stick or a DVD at least 4GB big and a laptop or desktop computer.</p>

		<h3>Tips</h3>
		<p>Our submission system works hard to preserve your anonymity, but we recommend you also take some of your own precautions. Please review these basic guidelines. </p>
		<div>
			<h4>1. Contact us if you have specific problems</h4>
			<p>If you have a very large submission, or a submission with a complex format, or are a high-risk source, please <a href="#submit_help_contact">contact us</a>. In our experience it is always possible to find a custom solution for even the most seemingly difficult situations.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h4>2. What computer to use</h4>
			<p>If the computer you are uploading from could subsequently be audited in an investigation, consider using a computer that is not easily tied to you. Technical users can also use <a href="https://tails.boum.org">Tails</a> to help ensure you do not leave any records of your submission on the computer.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h4>3. Do not talk about your submission to others</h4>
			<p>If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in source protection – it is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This includes other media organisations.</p>
		</div>

	</div>

		<h3>After</h3>

		<div>
			<h4>1. Do not talk about your submission to others</h4>
			<p>If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in source protection – it is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This includes other media organisations.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h4>2. Act normal</h4>
			<p>If you are a high-risk source, avoid saying anything or doing anything after submitting which might promote suspicion. In particular, you should try to stick to your normal routine and behaviour.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h4>3. Remove traces of your submission</h4>
			<p>If you are a high-risk source and the computer you prepared your submission on, or uploaded it from, could subsequently be audited in an investigation, we recommend that you format and dispose of the computer hard drive and any other storage media you used.</p>
			<p>In particular, hard drives retain data after formatting which may be visible to a digital forensics team and flash media (USB sticks, memory cards and SSD drives) retain data even after a secure erasure. If you used flash media to store sensitive data, it is important to destroy the media.</p>
			<p>If you do this and are a high-risk source you should make sure there are no traces of the clean-up, since such traces themselves may draw suspicion.</p>
			<div>
				<h4>4. If you face legal action</h4>
				<p>If a legal action is brought against you as a result of your submission, there are organisations that may help you. The Courage Foundation is an international organisation dedicated to the protection of journalistic sources. You can find more details at <a href="https://www.couragefound.org">https://www.couragefound.org</a>.</p>

		<p>WikiLeaks publishes documents of political or historical importance that are censored or otherwise suppressed. We specialise in strategic global publishing and large archives.</p>
		<p>The following is the address of our secure site where you can anonymously upload your documents to WikiLeaks editors. You can only access this submissions system through Tor. (See our <a href="#submit_help_tor">Tor tab</a> for more information.) We also advise you to read our <a href="#submit_help_tips">tips for sources</a> before submitting.</p>

			<!--<div>
				Copy this address into your Tor browser. Advanced users, if they wish, can also add a further layer of encryption to their submission using <a href="#submit_wlkey">our public PGP key</a>.
			</div>-->
		</div>

		<p>If you cannot use Tor, or your submission is very large, or you have specific requirements, WikiLeaks provides several alternative methods. <a href="#submit_help_contact">Contact us</a> to discuss how to proceed.</p>

1. SUMMARY: DUE TO HIGH LEVEL CONGRESSIONAL AND CABINET
VISITS AND VARIOUS ONGOING NEGOTIATIONS WITH CHINESE UNITS
EMBASSY WAS UNABLE DURING THIS PERIBD TO DO OUR MRMAL MONTHLY
BUSINESS ACTIVITY REPORT. THIS REPORT PROVIDES A SUMMARY
FOR THE BUSINESS ACTIVITY IN THAT PERIOD. IN GENERAL, THE
AMOUNT OF ACTIVITY IN TERMS OF U.S. BUSINESS PERSONS ACTIVE
IN BEIJING REMAINED HIGH THROUGHOUT THE PERIOD. THROUGHOUT
THE PERIOD THERE WAS A STEADY EXPANSION OF &quot;PERMANENT&quot; BUSINESS
OFFICES BEING MAINTAINED BY U.S. COMPANIES. GROUPS OF BUSINESSMEN ON TECHNICAL SEMINARS OR ACCOMPANYING HIGH USG OFFICIALS
AND CODELS REACHED NEW HIGHS.

2. IN TERMS OF SERIOUS CONTRACT DISCUSSIONS, HOWEVER, THE
PERIOD PRODUCED VERY LITTLE ACTIVITY. THE EXCEPTIONS TO
THIS RULE WERE DISCUSSIONS THAT REQUIRED LITTLE OR NO OUTLAY
OF CHINESE FOREIGN EXCHANGE (THE CONTRACTS FOR OFFSHORE
SEISMIC WORK AND THE NUMEROUS DISCUSSIONS ABOUT JOINT VENTURES
AND COMPENSATION TRADE) OR WERE FOR PRODUCTS SUCH AS FERTI-

LIZER, FIATR OR STEEL. THERE SEEMED TO BE A SLIGHT PICK-UP
OF BUSINESS ACTIVITY TOWARD THE END OF THE PERIOD WHEN SEVERAL
SMALL EQUIPMENT CONTRACTS WERE SIGNED. END SUMMARY.
3. MAJOR DEVELOPMENTS AND COMPANIES VISITING BEIJING ARE
LISTED BELOW BY MAJOR ECONOMIC SECTOR.
- OIL EXPLORATION
4. THE BIG NEWS OF THE PERIOD WAS, OF COURSE, THE SIGNING
OF CONTRACTS TO DO SEISMIC WORK IN THE SOUTH CHINA SEA.
FOUR SUCH CONTRACTS WERE SIGNED DURING THE VISIT OF VICE
PREMIER KANG SHIEN TO THE UNITED STATES. THE OPERATING COMPANIES THAT ORGANIZED THESE FOUR GROUPS WERE EXXON, PHILLIPS,
MOBIL AND TEXACO AND CHEVRON, BUT MANY OTHER U.S. COMPANIES
WILL BE INVOLVED AS PARTICIPANTS. BASICALLY THE CONTRACTS
CALL FOR THE COMPANIES TO DO THE SEISMIC WORK (INCLUDING
THE ANALYSIS) AT NO COST TO CHINA. WHEN CHINA AWARDS BIDS
FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OR DRILLING STAGE THE COMPANIES WINNING
THE RIGHT TO DEVELOP THE FIELDS WILL PAY FOR THE DATA AND
THUS COVER THE COSTS INCURRED DURING THE PRESENT STAGE. TWO
OTHER GROUPS WERE VERY ACTIVE IN BEIJING DURING THE PERIOD
AND THEIR DISCUSSIONS EVENTUALLY (I.E., AFTER JULY 1) PRODUCED
SUCCESSFUL CONTRACTS FOR THE SAME KIND OF WORK IN THE SOUTH
CHINA SEA AROUND HAINAN. ONE GROUP WAS LED BY AMOCO (INCLUDING
PENNZOIL, CITIES SERVICE AND UNION OIL CO.) AND ANOTHER BY

ARCO (WHO IS WORKING WITH SANTA FE). ARCO ACTUALLY BEGAN
EXPLORATION BEFORE THE END OF JUNE SOUTH OF HAINAN, EVEN
BEFORE CONCLUDING THEIR CONTRACT. ALL OF THESE COMPANIES
AND MANY MORE WERE PRESENT IN BEIJING ON VARIOUS OCCASIONS
FOR THESE DISCUSSIONS.
5. OTHER COMPANIES THAT VISITED BEIJING DURING THIS PERIOD
BUT WERE, AS FAR AS WE KNOW, UNSUCCESSFUL INCLUDED: GULF
OIL CO. (WHO TALKED WITH THE CHINESE ABOUT AREAS CLOSE TO
TAIWAN); REINAUER PETROLEUM CO. (HACKENSACK, NEW JERSEY);
OCCIDENTAL PETROLEUM CO. (LED BY ARMAND HAMMER AND FORMER
SENATOR GORE).
6. THERE WAS ALSO AN INTERESTING DEVELOPMENT IN ONSHORE OIL
EXPLORATION. USGS TEAMS WERE TAKEN TO THREE OF CHINA'S MOST
REMOTE OIL FIELDS IN GUANGXI, QINGHAI, AND SICHUAN. IT APPEARS
THAT THE CHINESE HAVE GREAT HOPE FOR THESE FIELDS (REF A).
CHINA PETROLEUM OFFICIALS TOLD THE EMBASSY THAT FOREIGNERS
ARE NOW PERMITTED TO DEVELOP ONSHORE OIL.
- OIL DRILLING EQUIPMENT

7. ALTHOUGH THIS SECTOR HAS BEEN A FOCAL POINT OF CHINESE
ACTIVITY IN THE PAST TWO YEARS, IN THIS MARCH-JUNE PERIOD
CHINESE BUYERS HAVE GENERALLY BEEN ON THE SIDELINE. ACCORDING
TO KNOWLEDGEABLE INDUSTRY SOURCES ONLY SMALL SPARE PARTS
CONTRACTS WERE SIGNED. SOME SPECIALIZED COMPANIES SUCH AS
BAKER TRADING COMPANY CHOSE TO LEAVE BEIJING FOR SEVERAL
MONTHS IN ORDER TO BETTER SPEND THEIR TIME IN THE U.S. HOWEVER, MOST COMPANIES WITH LONG-TERM CHINA INTERESTS IN THIS
AREA WERE IN BEIJING DURING THE PERIOD IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN
CONTACT WITH CHINA'S BUYERS. EMBASSY NOTED THE PRESENCE
OF DRESSER, NATIONAL SUPPLY, CATERPILLAR'S PETROLEUM EQUIPMENT
DIVISION, SMITH INTERNATIONAL, UNIT RIG AND EQUIPMENT COMPANY,
AND CREST ENGINEERING (A PIPELINE ENGINEERING COMPANY).

JUNE AND WAS TAKEN TO SICHUAN AFTER THEIR PROGRAM OF TECHNICAL

8. DESPITE OFFICIAL CHINESE STATEMENTS THAT SEEMED TO INDICATE THAT THESE TWO SECTORS HAD RECEIVED RELATIVELY TOO MUCH
EMPHASIS IN THE PAST YEAR OR SO, BUSINESS ACTIVITY CONTINUED
AT AN ACTIVE PACE THROUGHOUT THIS PERIOD. THE NATIONAL COUNCIL
FOR US-CHINA TRADE SENT THREE CONSTRUCTION DELEGATIONS TO
CHINA DURING THIS PERIOD AND SEEMED PLEASED WITH THEIR
RECEPTION. THE STATE CAPITAL CONSTRUCTION COMMISSION TOOK

15. MARCH THROUGH JUNE RESULTED IN NO SIGNIFICANT DEALS
FOR TRANSPORT EQUIPMENT THAT WE ARE AWARE OF. THE BIG NEWS
OF THE PERIOD, OF COURSE, WAS THE EXCHANGE OF FLAG SHIPS
BETWEEN THE U.S. AND CHINA. LYKES LINES ARRANGED FOR A CHINESE
SHIP TO CALL IN SEATTLE DURING APRIL IN RETURN FOR A CALL
IN SHANGHAI BY A LYKES SHIP (REF I). THIS WAS FOLLOWED BY
THE CALL OF A U.S. LINES INC. CONTAINER SHIP AT HUANGPU

BY DISCUSSING A LIMITED AND TEMPORARY CHARTER SERVICE BETWEEN
THE U.S. AND CHINA (REF J). DISCUSSIONS ON COPRODUCTION

ON THE ONE SIDE AND AMERICAN MOTORS (A JEEP PLANT IN BEIJING)
AND GM (A MAJOR TRUCK COMPLEX ALONG THE CHANGJIANG IN THE
VICINITY OF WUHAN) ON THE OTHER. A DIVISION OF BOEING AIRCRAFT
COMPANY THAT PRODUCES JET FOIL BOATS VISITED BEIJING. THEY
HOPE TO SELL BOATS TO CHINA, BUT THE CHINESE ARE MORE INTERESTED IN THE TECHNOLOGY. LOCKHEED AND DOUGLAS AIRCRAFT
CONTINUED TO AGGRESSIVELY PUSH THEIR PRODUCTS (BOTH COMPANIES
NOW HAVE &quot;PERMANENT&quot; ROOMS IN THE BEIJING HOTEL). OTHER

- HOTELS AND TRADE CENTER PROJECT
16. THIS PERIOD WAS GENERALLY ONE OF GREAT DISAPPOINTMENT
TO POTENTIAL HOTEL BUILDERS. CHINA PULLED BACK FROM ITS
EARLIER GREAT URGENCY IN SIGNING LETTERS OF INTENT. TOWARDS
THE END OF THE PERIOD, CHINESE INTEREST SHIFTED NOTICEABLY
TO REFURBISHING EXISTING HOTELS, BUILDING SMALLER AND CHEAPER
HOTELS AND PROVIDING MORE OF THE RESOURCES DOMESTICALLY.
NEVERTHELESS, U.S. HOTEL BUILDERS, ALONG WITH MANY OTHERS,
CONTINUEED THE ACTIVE QUEST. INTERCONTINENTAL HOTELS RETURNED
WITH A CHEAPER, LESS EXTRAVAGANT PROPOSAL BUT DID NOT APPEAR
VERY OPTIMISTIC WHEN WE SAW THEM IN BEIJING. HILTON WAS
IN BEIJING AND WE KNOW THAT HYATT AND HOLIDAY INNS REMAINED
VERY INTERESTED AND VISITED BEIJING SEVERAL TIMES. THE
APPARENT DECISION TO OPT FOR CHEAPER HOTELS WITH PERHAPS
LESS COMMITMENT TO WESTERN MANAGEMENT INVOLVEMENT HAS SPAWNED
A LARGE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUAL HOTEL PROJECTS. THOSE THAT
HAVE COME TO OUR ATTENTION INCLUDE A HOTEL FOR BEIJING'S
WESTERN HILLS (HYATT AND I.M. PEI ARE SAID TO BE INVOLVED);
MODERN MEDIUM SIZED (15-20 STORIES) HOTELS FOR BEIJING AND
SHANGHAI (C.B. SUNG OF CLEVELAND HAS ORGANIZED A GROUP
BACKED BY THE CYRUS EATON FAMILY); A BEIJING HOTEL THAT IS
BEING PUSHED BY MR. VALENTIN YEH (U.S.) AND A HONG KONG

TRADE CENTER, NY). IN ADDITION, A SAN FRANCISCO ARCHITECT
(CLEMENT CHEN), AND TWO NEW YORK GROUPS (U.S. SINOTECH CORP.
AND THE CHINA GROUP) HAVE ALL MADE HOTEL PROPOSALS.
17. THE BIG NEWS WAS THE AWARD OF A PRELIMINARY ENGINEERING
AND DESIGN CONTRACT FOR A TRADE CENTER IN BEIJING TO A U.S.
CONSORTIUM LED BY TURNER CONSTRUCTION COMPANY, KAISER ENGINEERS AND CHASE MANHATTAN BANK. THE CONTRACT IS ONLY FOR
INITIAL DESIGN WORK ALTHOUGH THE CHINESE ALSO SIGNED A NONBINDING PROTOCOL STATING THEIR INTENTION TO LET THE SAME

- COMPENSATION TRADE, COPRODUCTION AND JOINT VENTURES
20. IN A PERIOD OF RELATIVE LACK OF HARD CONTRACTS, THE
MOST INTERESTING AND POTENTIALLY FAR-REACHING CHANGE IN
CHINA'S FOREIGN TRADE SYSTEM CONCERNED CHINA'S ENCOURAGEMENT
OF MANY MORE FLEXIBLE BUSINESS PRACTICES SUCH AS: PROCESSING
OF IMPORTED MATERIALS (CMT IN GARMENTS), COMPENSATION TRADE
(WHERE CHINA TRADES PRODUCTS FOR EQUIPMENT); AND JOINT
VENTURES. TWO ADDITIONAL FACTORS COMBINED TO PRODUCE A FLURRY
OF ACTIVITY THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN UNTHINKABLE ONLY SIX MONTHS
AGO. THESE WERE AN INCREASING WILLINGNESS TO ALLOW UNITS
OUTSIDE THE FOREIGN TRADE MINISTRY (LOCAL GOVERNMENTS, MINISTRIES AND EVEN FACTORIES) TO INITIATE PROJECTS (REFS M
AND N) AND A LACK OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE FOR ANYTHING BUT THE
HIGHEST PRIORITY PROJECTS. THIS COMBINED TO PRODUCE A SITUATION
WHERE RELATIVELY LOW PRIORITY UNITS (ESPECIALLY PROVINCIAL
OR MUNICIPAL LEVEL FOREIGN TRADE BUREAUS) TOLD FOREIGNERS
THAT THEY HAD NO ACCESS TO FOREIGN EXCHANGE BUT COULD CONSIDER
ANY COPRODUCTION PROPOSAL THAT COULD BE PAID OFF IN PRODUCT.

WE ARE AWARE OF THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSIONS: IN THE AREA OF
TEXTILES, VERONICA YHAP OF DRAGON LADY TRADERS DISCUSSED
(AND FINALLY REACHED AGREEMENT) ON A JOINT COMPENSATION
AGREEMENT FOR A DALIEN TEXTILE FACTORY; MADAME HAN OF CHINATEX TOLD US THAT BURLINGTON INDUSTRIES AND LEVI STRAUSS

TRADE; AS HAS TIMEX COMPANY (THEY LEFT BEIJING QUITE CONFIDENT
THAT THEY WERE CLOSE TO A CONTRACT FOR A WATCH MAKING FACTORY)

2. IN TERMS OF SERIOUS CONTRACT DISCUSSIONS, HOWEVER, THE
PERIOD PRODUCED VERY LITTLE ACTIVITY. THE EXCEPTIONS TO
THIS RULE WERE DISCUSSIONS THAT REQUIRED LITTLE OR NO OUTLAY

AND COMPENSATION TRADE) OR WERE FOR PRODUCTS SUCH AS FERTI-

OF BUSINESS ACTIVITY TOWARD THE END OF THE PERIOD WHEN SEVERAL
SMALL EQUIPMENT CONTRACTS WERE SIGNED. END SUMMARY.
3. MAJOR DEVELOPMENTS AND COMPANIES VISITING BEIJING ARE
LISTED BELOW BY MAJOR ECONOMIC SECTOR.
- OIL EXPLORATION
4. THE BIG NEWS OF THE PERIOD WAS, OF COURSE, THE SIGNING
OF CONTRACTS TO DO SEISMIC WORK IN THE SOUTH CHINA SEA.
FOUR SUCH CONTRACTS WERE SIGNED DURING THE VISIT OF VICE
PREMIER KANG SHIEN TO THE UNITED STATES. THE OPERATING COMPANIES THAT ORGANIZED THESE FOUR GROUPS WERE EXXON, PHILLIPS,
MOBIL AND TEXACO AND CHEVRON, BUT MANY OTHER U.S. COMPANIES
WILL BE INVOLVED AS PARTICIPANTS. BASICALLY THE CONTRACTS
CALL FOR THE COMPANIES TO DO THE SEISMIC WORK (INCLUDING
THE ANALYSIS) AT NO COST TO CHINA. WHEN CHINA AWARDS BIDS
FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OR DRILLING STAGE THE COMPANIES WINNING
THE RIGHT TO DEVELOP THE FIELDS WILL PAY FOR THE DATA AND
THUS COVER THE COSTS INCURRED DURING THE PRESENT STAGE. TWO
OTHER GROUPS WERE VERY ACTIVE IN BEIJING DURING THE PERIOD
AND THEIR DISCUSSIONS EVENTUALLY (I.E., AFTER JULY 1) PRODUCED
SUCCESSFUL CONTRACTS FOR THE SAME KIND OF WORK IN THE SOUTH
CHINA SEA AROUND HAINAN. ONE GROUP WAS LED BY AMOCO (INCLUDING
PENNZOIL, CITIES SERVICE AND UNION OIL CO.) AND ANOTHER BY

ARCO (WHO IS WORKING WITH SANTA FE). ARCO ACTUALLY BEGAN
EXPLORATION BEFORE THE END OF JUNE SOUTH OF HAINAN, EVEN
BEFORE CONCLUDING THEIR CONTRACT. ALL OF THESE COMPANIES
AND MANY MORE WERE PRESENT IN BEIJING ON VARIOUS OCCASIONS
FOR THESE DISCUSSIONS.
5. OTHER COMPANIES THAT VISITED BEIJING DURING THIS PERIOD
BUT WERE, AS FAR AS WE KNOW, UNSUCCESSFUL INCLUDED: GULF
OIL CO. (WHO TALKED WITH THE CHINESE ABOUT AREAS CLOSE TO
TAIWAN); REINAUER PETROLEUM CO. (HACKENSACK, NEW JERSEY);
OCCIDENTAL PETROLEUM CO. (LED BY ARMAND HAMMER AND FORMER
SENATOR GORE).
6. THERE WAS ALSO AN INTERESTING DEVELOPMENT IN ONSHORE OIL
EXPLORATION. USGS TEAMS WERE TAKEN TO THREE OF CHINA'S MOST
REMOTE OIL FIELDS IN GUANGXI, QINGHAI, AND SICHUAN. IT APPEARS
THAT THE CHINESE HAVE GREAT HOPE FOR THESE FIELDS (REF A).
CHINA PETROLEUM OFFICIALS TOLD THE EMBASSY THAT FOREIGNERS
ARE NOW PERMITTED TO DEVELOP ONSHORE OIL.

7. ALTHOUGH THIS SECTOR HAS BEEN A FOCAL POINT OF CHINESE
ACTIVITY IN THE PAST TWO YEARS, IN THIS MARCH-JUNE PERIOD
CHINESE BUYERS HAVE GENERALLY BEEN ON THE SIDELINE. ACCORDING
TO KNOWLEDGEABLE INDUSTRY SOURCES ONLY SMALL SPARE PARTS
CONTRACTS WERE SIGNED. SOME SPECIALIZED COMPANIES SUCH AS
BAKER TRADING COMPANY CHOSE TO LEAVE BEIJING FOR SEVERAL
MONTHS IN ORDER TO BETTER SPEND THEIR TIME IN THE U.S. HOWEVER, MOST COMPANIES WITH LONG-TERM CHINA INTERESTS IN THIS
AREA WERE IN BEIJING DURING THE PERIOD IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN
CONTACT WITH CHINA'S BUYERS. EMBASSY NOTED THE PRESENCE
OF DRESSER, NATIONAL SUPPLY, CATERPILLAR'S PETROLEUM EQUIPMENT

16. THIS PERIOD WAS GENERALLY ONE OF GREAT DISAPPOINTMENT
TO POTENTIAL HOTEL BUILDERS. CHINA PULLED BACK FROM ITS
EARLIER GREAT URGENCY IN SIGNING LETTERS OF INTENT. TOWARDS
THE END OF THE PERIOD, CHINESE INTEREST SHIFTED NOTICEABLY
TO REFURBISHING EXISTING HOTELS, BUILDING SMALLER AND CHEAPER
HOTELS AND PROVIDING MORE OF THE RESOURCES DOMESTICALLY.
NEVERTHELESS, U.S. HOTEL BUILDERS, ALONG WITH MANY OTHERS,
CONTINUEED THE ACTIVE QUEST. INTERCONTINENTAL HOTELS RETURNED
WITH A CHEAPER, LESS EXTRAVAGANT PROPOSAL BUT DID NOT APPEAR
VERY OPTIMISTIC WHEN WE SAW THEM IN BEIJING. HILTON WAS
IN BEIJING AND WE KNOW THAT HYATT AND HOLIDAY INNS REMAINED
VERY INTERESTED AND VISITED BEIJING SEVERAL TIMES. THE
APPARENT DECISION TO OPT FOR CHEAPER HOTELS WITH PERHAPS
LESS COMMITMENT TO WESTERN MANAGEMENT INVOLVEMENT HAS SPAWNED
A LARGE NUMBER OF INDIVIDUAL HOTEL PROJECTS. THOSE THAT
HAVE COME TO OUR ATTENTION INCLUDE A HOTEL FOR BEIJING'S
WESTERN HILLS (HYATT AND I.M. PEI ARE SAID TO BE INVOLVED);
MODERN MEDIUM SIZED (15-20 STORIES) HOTELS FOR BEIJING AND
SHANGHAI (C.B. SUNG OF CLEVELAND HAS ORGANIZED A GROUP

MOST INTERESTING AND POTENTIALLY FAR-REACHING CHANGE IN
CHINA'S FOREIGN TRADE SYSTEM CONCERNED CHINA'S ENCOURAGEMENT
OF MANY MORE FLEXIBLE BUSINESS PRACTICES SUCH AS: PROCESSING
OF IMPORTED MATERIALS (CMT IN GARMENTS), COMPENSATION TRADE
(WHERE CHINA TRADES PRODUCTS FOR EQUIPMENT); AND JOINT
VENTURES. TWO ADDITIONAL FACTORS COMBINED TO PRODUCE A FLURRY
OF ACTIVITY THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN UNTHINKABLE ONLY SIX MONTHS
AGO. THESE WERE AN INCREASING WILLINGNESS TO ALLOW UNITS
OUTSIDE THE FOREIGN TRADE MINISTRY (LOCAL GOVERNMENTS, MINISTRIES AND EVEN FACTORIES) TO INITIATE PROJECTS (REFS M
AND N) AND A LACK OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE FOR ANYTHING BUT THE
HIGHEST PRIORITY PROJECTS. THIS COMBINED TO PRODUCE A SITUATION
WHERE RELATIVELY LOW PRIORITY UNITS (ESPECIALLY PROVINCIAL
OR MUNICIPAL LEVEL FOREIGN TRADE BUREAUS) TOLD FOREIGNERS
THAT THEY HAD NO ACCESS TO FOREIGN EXCHANGE BUT COULD CONSIDER
ANY COPRODUCTION PROPOSAL THAT COULD BE PAID OFF IN PRODUCT.

CAUSED A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN THE EMBASSY E/C SECTION
WORKLOAD, SINCE ALL SUCH REQUESTS MUST BE SUBMITTED TO THE
CHINESE AUTHORITIES THROUGH DIPLOMATIC CHANNELS. SOME BUSINESSMEN VISITING CHINA AS TOURISTS WERE GIVEN USEFUL INTRODUCTORY MEETINGS. ONE CASE IN POINT IS A REPRESENTATIVE

LA.) WHO WAS ABLE TO SEE BOTH MACHIMPEX AND LIGHT INDUSTRY
WHILE ON A TOURIST TRIP.

TO BE DISTRIBUTED BY CCPIT AND WILL DEVOTE EACH ISSUE TO
SPECIALIZED TOPICS. AS ORIGINALLY CONCEIVED, AHE FIRST TWO
TOPICS WERE TO BE CIVIL ENGINEERING AND POWER. THE MAGAZINE
WILL DRAW ITS REVENUE FROM AOERTISING BY WESTERN COMPANIES.
