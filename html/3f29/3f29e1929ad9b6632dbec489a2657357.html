		<h3>Tor</h3>
		<p><a href="https://www.torproject.org">Tor</a> is an encrypted anonymising network that makes it harder to intercept internet communications, or see where communications are coming from or going to.</p>
		<p>In order to use the WikiLeaks public submission system as detailed above you can download the Tor Browser Bundle, which is a Firefox-like browser available for Windows, Mac OS X and GNU/Linux and pre-configured to connect using the anonymising system Tor.</p>
		<h4>Tails</h4>
		<p>If you are at high risk and you have the capacity to do so, you can also access the submission system through a secure operating system called <a href="https://tails.boum.org">Tails</a>. Tails is an operating system launched from a USB stick or a DVD that aim to leaves no traces when the computer is shut down after use and automatically routes your internet traffic through Tor. Tails will require you to have either a USB stick or a DVD at least 4GB big and a laptop or desktop computer.</p>

		<h3>Tips</h3>
		<p>Our submission system works hard to preserve your anonymity, but we recommend you also take some of your own precautions. Please review these basic guidelines. </p>
		<div>
			<h4>1. Contact us if you have specific problems</h4>
			<p>If you have a very large submission, or a submission with a complex format, or are a high-risk source, please <a href="#submit_help_contact">contact us</a>. In our experience it is always possible to find a custom solution for even the most seemingly difficult situations.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h4>2. What computer to use</h4>
			<p>If the computer you are uploading from could subsequently be audited in an investigation, consider using a computer that is not easily tied to you. Technical users can also use <a href="https://tails.boum.org">Tails</a> to help ensure you do not leave any records of your submission on the computer.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h4>3. Do not talk about your submission to others</h4>
			<p>If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in source protection – it is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This includes other media organisations.</p>
		</div>

	</div>

		<h3>After</h3>

		<div>
			<h4>1. Do not talk about your submission to others</h4>
			<p>If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in source protection – it is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This includes other media organisations.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h4>2. Act normal</h4>
			<p>If you are a high-risk source, avoid saying anything or doing anything after submitting which might promote suspicion. In particular, you should try to stick to your normal routine and behaviour.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h4>3. Remove traces of your submission</h4>
			<p>If you are a high-risk source and the computer you prepared your submission on, or uploaded it from, could subsequently be audited in an investigation, we recommend that you format and dispose of the computer hard drive and any other storage media you used.</p>
			<p>In particular, hard drives retain data after formatting which may be visible to a digital forensics team and flash media (USB sticks, memory cards and SSD drives) retain data even after a secure erasure. If you used flash media to store sensitive data, it is important to destroy the media.</p>
			<p>If you do this and are a high-risk source you should make sure there are no traces of the clean-up, since such traces themselves may draw suspicion.</p>
			<div>
				<h4>4. If you face legal action</h4>
				<p>If a legal action is brought against you as a result of your submission, there are organisations that may help you. The Courage Foundation is an international organisation dedicated to the protection of journalistic sources. You can find more details at <a href="https://www.couragefound.org">https://www.couragefound.org</a>.</p>

		<p>WikiLeaks publishes documents of political or historical importance that are censored or otherwise suppressed. We specialise in strategic global publishing and large archives.</p>
		<p>The following is the address of our secure site where you can anonymously upload your documents to WikiLeaks editors. You can only access this submissions system through Tor. (See our <a href="#submit_help_tor">Tor tab</a> for more information.) We also advise you to read our <a href="#submit_help_tips">tips for sources</a> before submitting.</p>

			<!--<div>
				Copy this address into your Tor browser. Advanced users, if they wish, can also add a further layer of encryption to their submission using <a href="#submit_wlkey">our public PGP key</a>.
			</div>-->
		</div>

		<p>If you cannot use Tor, or your submission is very large, or you have specific requirements, WikiLeaks provides several alternative methods. <a href="#submit_help_contact">Contact us</a> to discuss how to proceed.</p>

TRANSCRIPT FOLLOWS:
4. BEGIN TEXT:
DENG: WELCOME, ALL OF YOU. DURING MY VISIT TO THE
UNITED STATES, I RECEIVED WARM HSOPITALITY FROM ALL
OF YOU, FOR WHICH I WISH TO EXPRESS MY DEEP THANKS.
WHEN I WAS IN THE UNITED STATES, ON ONE OCCASION
ALONE, AT ATLANTA, I WAS HONORED TO MEET SEVENTEEN
GOVERNORS. I UNDERSTAND THAT AMONG THEM ARE FIVE OF
YOU HERE NOW-SO WE ARE OLD FRIENDS.
GOVERNOR MILLIKEN (AFTER EXPRESSING GRATITUDE ON
CONFIDENTIAL

STATE 274506

BEHALF OF THE GOVERNORS AND THEIR ENTOURAGE):
WE REMEMBER VERY WELL IN THE U.S YOUR HISTORIC VISIT
TO OUR COUNTRY. I HAVE BEEN ASKED BY AMBASSADOR
WOODCOCK ON BEHALF OF PRESIDENT CARTER TO
FORMALLY PRESENT TO YOU A PICTORIAL RECORD OF
YOUR VISIT TO THE UNITED STATES IN JANUARY. INCLUDED
IS A PICTURE OF YOUR VISIT WITH THE SEVENTEEN
GOVERNORS IN ATLANTA; AND, AS YOU NOTED IN YOUR
COMMENTS, FIVE OF THOSE GOVERNORS ARE HERE
TODAY. SO, IT GIVES ME GREAT PLEASURE ON BEHALF OF
AMBASSADOR WOODCOCK AND PRESIDENT CARTER TO PRESENT
YOU WITH THIS ALBUM.
DENG: THANK YOU. PLEASE CONVEY MY GREETINGS TO
PRESIDENT CARTER, AND ALSO MY GRATITUDE. MY STAY IN
THE U.S. WAS NOT A LONG ONE-ONLY ABOUT EIGHT DAYS.
BUT IT WAS A VERY PLEASANT ONE; IT LEFT ME WITH VERY
PLEASANT MEMORAIES. MAYBE MOST OF YOU HAVE COME FOR
THE FIRST TIME. OUR VISITS TO THE UNITED STATES AND
THE VISIT TO CHINA BY ALL OF YOU, INCLUDING VISITS
BY OTHER AMERICAN FRIENDS--EACH ONE OF THESE HAS BEEN
VERY BENEFICIAL FOR THE PROMOTION OF MUTUAL UNDERSTANDING
AND FRIENDLY RELATIONS BETWEEN OUR TWO COUNTRIES. BUT
OUR RECEIPTION GIVEN TO YOU MAY NOT BE AS GOOD AS THE
RECEIPTION GIVEN US, BECAUSE OUR CONDITIONS IN THE
PRC ARE NOT GOOD.
NOW, YOU HAVE ALRADY BEEN IN BEIJING THREEE
DAYS; YOU WILL ALSO BE VISITING OTHER PARTS OF CHINA?

MILLIKEN: YES; WE WILL BE VISITING JIANAN N NANING,
AND SHANGHAI; AND THEN, AFTER THAT, WE ARE GOING TO
THAILAND TO SEE SOME REFUGEE CAMPS. WE ARE ALL
CONCERNED ABOUT THE PLIGHT OF THOSE REFUGEES. WE KNOW
THAT YOUR COUNTRY HAS BEEN VERY GENEROUS ABOUT
RECEIVING SOME OF THESE REFUGEES.
DENG: WE ALREADY HAVE RECEIVED MORE THAN 200,000.
CONFIDENTIAL
PAGE 04

STATE 274506

MILLIKEN: I KNOW THAT THE GOVERNORS HERE HAVE
QUESTIONS, AND IF I MAY, (I WILL) START OUT BY ASKING
A QUESTION ABOUT REFUGEES: WHAT IS GOING TO
BE THE ULTIMATE RESOLUTION OF THAT QUESTION, AND
WHAT ROLE WILL THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA PLAY
IN THAT RESOLUTION?
DENG: THE REASON FOR THECREATION OF REFUGEES MAINLY
IS DUE TO THE ATTACK BY VIETNAM INTO KAMPUCHEA. BUT
BEFORE THAT--OF COURSE, I'M NOT GOING TO COMMENT ON
THE POLICIES OF THE POL POT GOVERNMENT WHEN THAT
GOVERNMENT WAS IN POWER. AND, TO BE FRANK, WE DIDN'T
AGREE WITH SOME OF THOSE POLICIES; TO BE FRANK, SOME OF
THOSE POLICIES WERE NOT POPULAR. BUT AT THAT TIME,
AT LEAST THERE WERE NO REFUGEES; THERE WERE NO LARGE
NUMBERS OF PEOPLE BEING DRIVEN OUT OF THAT COUNTRY.
BUT NOW THE VIETNAMESE ATTACK HAS RESULTED IN THE
PEOPLE OF KAMPUCHEA FINDING IT DIFFICULT EVEN TO
LIVE, TO EXIST.
FIRST, THERE IS THE UNIVERSAL SITUATION OF
FAMINE, BECAUSE OF THE INABILITY (OF THE PEOPLE) TO
GO AHEAD WITH PRODUCTION. OF COURSE, THE EXODUS OF
A LARGE NUMBER OF REFUGEES TO A CERTAIN EXTENT HAS
BEEN THE RESULT OF THE POLICIES FOLLOWEDY BY POL POT.
BUT THE MAIN REASON FOR THIS PROBLEM IS THE RESULT
OF AGGRESSION AGAINST KAMPUCHEANS BY VIETNAMESE
TROOPS. SO, FOR A GENUINE SETTLEMENT IT IS
NECESSARY THAT THE WHOLE WORLD GIVE ASSISTANCE TOWARD
ACHIEVING A POLITICAL SETTLMENT. THE WHOLE WORLD
NEEDS TO GIVE MORAL HELP, MATERIAL HELPAND
POLITICAL HELP TO THE KAMPUCHEANS, TO FORCE
VIETNAME TO WITHDRAW FROM KAMPUCHEA; AND ONLY AFTER

THAT IS DONE CAN THE PROBLEM BE SOLVED. NOW, IT IS
ALSO NECESSARY THAT HELP BE GIVEN TO THE PEOPLE OF
KAMPUCHEA, SOMETHING TO EAT AND MEDICAL AID. IT
IS ALSO VERY NECESSARY TO GIVE A FAIRLY GOOD
RESETTLEMENT OPPORTUNITY TO REFUGEES DRIVEN OUT OF

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
THE COUNTRY, AND TO GIVE THEM RELIEF. SO, IT IS A
GOOD THING THAT THE WORLD HAS TAKEN SOME MEASURES
INTERNATIONALLY IN THIS RESPECT. NOT ONLY REFUGEES
WHO HAVE COME OUT OF THE COUNTRY ARE IN A CONDITION
OF HUNGER; BUT ALSO INSIDE, AS WELL, A STATE OF WAR
HAS MEANT A HALT OF PRODUCTION; THERE ARE NO
COMMODITIES AVAILABLE AND THEREFORE THOSE INSIDE KAMPUCHEAA
ARE ALSO IN A VERY DIFFICULT POSITION. BUT THE
QUESTION IS -- THAT RELIEF GOODS MUST BE USED ON
VICTIMIZED REFUGEES THEMSELVES. THEY MUST NOT BE ALLOWED
TO FALL INTO THE HANDS OF EITHER THE VIETNAMESE OR
THE PUPPET REGIME OF HENG SAMRIN. WE'VE HAD THIS
EXPERIENCE IN THE PAST. WE GAVE A GREAT DEAL OF
ASSISTANCE TO VIETNAM. AND AT THE SAME TIME, DURING
WARTIME, WE WERE GIVING HELP TO KAMPUCHEA. BUT ALL
THINGS DESTINED FOR KAMPUCHEA HAD TO CROSS VIETNAM,
AND IN THE PROCESS VIETNAME KEPT THE GREATEST PART
FOR ITSELF; WHAT GOT TO THE KAMPUCHEAN SIDE WAS
VERY SMALL.
SO, THE BEST WAY IS TO FORCE VIETNAM TO COMMIT
ITSELF AND GUARANTEE THAT THESE THINGS WILL GO MOSTLY
TO KAMPUCHEANS; AND ALSO, FOR THE INTERNATIOAL
RELIEF ORGANIZATION PEOPLE TO GIVE THINGS DIRECTLY TO
THE PEOPLE INSIDE KAMPUCHEA. OTHERWISE, NOT ONLY
WILL THE GENUINELY-VICTIMIZED KAMPUCHEANS NOT BE ABLE
TO GER THESE THINGS; IN ADDITION, THESE MATERIALS
COULD BE TURNED INTO AID FOR THE VIETNAMESE
AGGRESSOR TROOPS. VIETNAME IS ALSO IN BAD SHAPE AND
NEEEDS THESE THINGS. SO, IF THEY GET THEM, THEY WILL
BE ENCOURAGED IN THEIR AGGRESSION. THE SAME
CONDITINS CAN ALSO BE APPLIED TO AREAS CONTROLLED
CONFIDENTIAL

STATE 274506

BY THE POL POT GOVERNMENT, AND THEY CAN BE ASKED TO
ACCEPT THESE CONDITIONS.
MILLIKEN: MANY OF OUR STATES ARE WORKING TOGETHER
ON THIS PROBLEM AND SETTLING MANY REFUGEES IN THEIR
STATES, MOST NOTABLY GOVERNOR RAY OF IOWA. WITH
YOUR APPROVAL, I WILL ASK EACH OF THE GOVERNORS TO
RAISE INDIVIDUAL PROBLEMS.
GOVERNOR ARIYOSHI: I WANT TO THE VICE PREMIER TO KNOW
THAT HAWAII HAD TAKEN IN BY MARCH OF THIS YEAR ONE
REFUGEE FOR EVERY 255 RESIDENTS.
GOVERNOR SNELLING: MR. VICE PREMIER, THE PEOPLE OF
THE UNITED STATES ARE EXICTED ABOUT YOUR PLANS TO
ACCELERATE TE PROGRESS OF THE FOUR MODERNIZATIONS
FOR CHINA-- EXCITED IN TERMS OF THE POTENTIAL
FOR THE CHINESE PEOPLE, EXCITED IN TERMS OF THE
SIGNIFICANCE FOR THE WORLD IN THE ACCELERATION OF THE

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
MODERNIZATION OF CHINA. BUT IT SEEMS TO US THAT
EVEN AT THE MAXIMUM RATE OF ACCELERATION, TO SUCCEED
AND BE DURABLE, THE PROCESS MAY TAKE SOME YEARS.
FRANKLY, SOME OF US WONDER HOW LONG YOU AND YOUR
ASSOCIATES HAVE TO DEMONSTRATE THAT YOUR PLAN-WHICH, BY THE WAY, WE THINK IS A VERY GOOD ONE-WILL SUCCEED?
(NOTE: THE CPIFA INTERPRETER, WHO SEEMED TO BE
IN DIFFICULTY THROUGHOUT THIS ESSSION, DID NOT
TRANSLATE THE LAST PART OF THIS QUESTION.)
DENG: ON THIS QUESTION OF THE FOUR MODERNIZATIONS
BEING PURSUED BY US WE HAVE EXPLAINED ON MANY
OCCASIONS, AND MADE IT CLEAR THAT WHEN WE TALK ABOUT
CONFIDENTIAL
PAGE 07

STATE 274506

THE FOUR MODERNIZATIONS THAT THIS MEANS THE FOUR
MODERNIZATIONS CHINESE STYLE. THE MOST OUTSTANDING CHARACTERISTICS OF CHINA ARE (AS FOLLOWS):
THE POPULATION IS BIG, TOO BIG. SO, EVEN IF WE ATTAIN
THE GOAL OF UPGRADING PRODUCTION T THE LEVELS WE
HAVE SET IN OUR TARGETS, EVEN IF WE ATTAIN THE GOALS
OF PRODUCING LOTS OF STEEL, VARIOUS KINDS OF INDUSTRIAL
PRODUCTS, AND FOOD GRAINS, OUR AVERAGE PER CAPITA
GNP WILL STILL NOT BE VERY HIGH COMPARED WITH MUCH OF
THE REST OF THE WORLD.
WE BELIEVE THAT THE MANS BY WHICH WE ARE
GOING TO MATERIALIZE OUR FOUR MODERNIZATIONS ARE
CORRECT. OUR POLICIES WE BELIEVE ARE CORRECT, INCLUDING
MAKING FULL USE OF ADVANCED FOREIGN TECHNOLOGY AND
FUNDS. IT IS ALSO IMPORTANT FOR CHINA TO EXPAND
ITS ECONOMIC EXCHANGE AND TRADE RELATIONS WITH THE
REST OF THE WORLD, FOR INSTANCE, IF IN OUR RELATIONS
WITH THE UNITED STATES, THE MOST FAVORED NATION
QUESTION CAN BE SETTLED IT CAN BE SAID WITH CERTAINTY
THAT THERE CAN BE A BETTER CHANCE FOR ECONOMIC
DEVELOPMENT AND TRADE TIES WITH THE U.S. A QUESTION
OF THE SAME NATURE IS, THAT IN REQUESTING THAT CHINA
BE GIVEN MOST FAVORED NATION STATUS, WE HAVE NOT
SOLVED THIS PROBLEM YET IN EUROPE AND JAPAN; THUS, IT
IS NECESSARY TO NEGOTIATE WITH THEM TO SOLVE THIS
PROBLEM. SO, WITHOUT THIS CONDITION (MFN STATUS),
EVEN IF WE IMPORTED FOREIGN TECHNOLOGY AND FUNDS,
WE WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO PAY IT ALL BACK.
CONSEQUENTLY, IN ORDER TO SOLVE THE PRLBLEM OF
REPAYMENT CAPABILITY AND ALSO SPEED UP THE
DEVELOPMENT OF THE CHINESE ECONOMY, WE HAVE PLANS TO
ADOPT MORE JOINT VENTURES. FOR EXAMPLE, SOME OF THE
AMERICAN OIL COMPANIES ARE PROSPECTING IN THE SOUTH
CHINA SEA. IF THE SURVEYS HAVE TURNED OUT FAVORABLY
AND THERE ARE INDICATIONS THAT (THE RESOURCES) ARE
WORTH EXPLOITING, IT CAN BE SAID WITH FULL

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
CONFIDENTIAL
PAGE 08

STATE 274506

ASSURANCE THAT JOINT VENTURES WITH FOREIGN COMPANIES
CAN BE INCLUDED--EITHER JOINT VENTURES OR PAYMENT BY
COMPENSATORY TRADE CAN BE UNDERTAKEN, AND THIS
DOESN'T ENTAIL THE PROBLEM OF REPAYMENT.
CHINA IS VERY RICH IN NATURAL RESOURCES,
ESPEICALLY NOFERROUS, RARE METALS. FOR INSTANCE,
TITANIUM; IT IS SAID THAT TO BUILD ONE BOEING 747
'JET AIRCRAFT) REQUIRES TWO TONS OF TITANIUM,
OF WHICH WE HAVE A LOT. SO, IN SOME AREAS,THIS
METHOD OF INTRODUCTION OF TECHNOLOGY AND FUNDS FROM
DEVELOPED COUNTRIES--IN SOME AREAS AND FROM SOME
COUNTRIES--CAN TAKE THE FORM OF JOINT VENTURES OR
POOLING CAPITAL AND RUNNING ENTERPRISES TOGETHER,
BECAUSE THIS KIND OF PROJECT HAS AN INHERENT METHOD
OF REPAYMENT. IN NEGOTIATIONS WITH SOME OF THESE
COUNTRIES AT THE MOMENT, WE HAVE MET ONE PROBLEM.
THESE COUNTRES ASK THAT PRODUCTS BE SOLD MAINLY TO
THE CHINESE INTERNALMARKET. BUT WITH REGARD TO
THIS QUESTION OF THE CHINESE DOMESTIC MARKET; SURELY,
IT IS POTENTIALLY A VERY BIG ONE. BUT ONLY AFTER
CHINA IS A BIT BETTER OFF, AFTER SOME YEARS. IN THE
NEAR FUTURE IT IS DIFFICULT FOR THIS TO BE TRUE.
WHAT WE WANT AT THE MOMENT, WHEN WE SAY JOINT
VENTURE AND COMPENSATORY TRADE, IS THAT THESE THINGS
SHOULD BE SOLD TO THE INTERNATIONAL MARKET. THIS CAN
SOLVE THE PROBLEM OF REPAYMENT. IT CAN BRING IN
MONEY, WHICH WE WANT, TO CHINA. AND SOME DOMESTIC
MARKET INSIDE CHINA CAN GRADUALLY BE DEVELOPED.
WITHOUT THIS STAGE, IT DON'T DO.
APART FROM THIS, WHAT WE ARE GOING TO DO IS AS
FOLLOWS: WE SHOLD LEARN TO HANDLE THE NEW
TECHNOLOGY WE ABSORB, AND ALSO MANAGEMENT. IN BOTH
FIELDS WE ARE BACKWARDS, SO WE ARE GOING TO MAKE AN
CONFIDENTIAL
PAGE 09

STATE 274506

EFFORT TO SOLVE THESE PROBLEMS.
GOVERNOR QUIE: LET ME ASK ABOUT IMPROVEMENT OF
MANAGEMENT SKILLS AND TECHNIQUES; AND LET ME ADD
ANOTHER ONE--AND I HOPE I DON'T OFFEND--THAT IS,
THE WORK ETHIC AND PRODUCTIVITY: HOW WILL YOU TRAIN
SCIENTISTS AND MANAGERS, AND WHAT WILL YOU GIVE
PEOPLE TO GETTHEM TO BELIEVE SO THAT THEY WILL
WORK HARDER?
DENG: AS YOU KNOW, IN CHINA WE HAVE SUFFERED FROM
A TEN-YEAR GAP WHEN WE DID NOT PRDUCE PEOPLE WITH
SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL SKILLS. SO, WE SAY WE HAVE

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
LOST ONE GENERATION. NOT ONLY IS THERE A LACK OF
TECHNICAL PERSONNEL, BUT PARTICULARLY, OF MANAGEMENT
PERSONNEL. CONSEQUENTLY, WE ARE GOING TO MAKE
UP THIS SIDE. SO, IN THIS RESPECT WE ARE GOING TO LEARN
FROM ADVANCED COUNTRIES NOT ONLY TECHNICAL KNOWLEDGE,
BUT ALSO BASIC MANAGEMENT SKILLS.
QUIE: LLET ME ADD THAT IN THE UNITED STATES OUR
POPULATION OF YOUNG PEOPLE IS SUCH THAT DURING THE
NINETTEN EIGHTIES WE WON'T HAVE AS MANY STUDENTS IN
SCHOOL AS IN THE NINETTEN SEVENTIES. SO, THIS IS
AN OPPORTUNITY FOR YOU TO SEND YOUR STUDENTS TO
STUDY IN OUR SCHOOLS. I AM HAPPY TO SAY THAT THE
UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA HAS WORKED OUT A STUDENT
EXCHANGE PROGRAM, AND SO HAVE OTHER INSTITUTIONS.
DENG: WORK IS BEING DONE RIGHT NOW ON THIS. BUT
THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS CANNOT BE INCREASED ALL OF
A SUDDEN BY LARGE NUMBERS USUALLY, IT IS MORE
BENEFICIAL AND PROPER TO SEND POST-GRADUATESTUDENTS
TO POST-GRADUATE INSTITUTIONS IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES.
BUT FOR THIS KIND OF STUDENT IT IS DIFFICULT TO
FIND THEM AT THE MOMENT AND THERE IS THE HANDICAP
CONFIDENTIAL
PAGE 10

STATE 274506

THAT THEY DO NOT KNOW FOREIGN LANGUAGES WELL ENOUGH.
GOVERNOR JUDGE: IN LIGHT OF THE MANY STRONG STATEMENTS THE CHAIRMAN (HUA) MADE IN PARIS ON THE SUBJECT
OF SOVIET AGGRESSION, WHAT DO YOU EXPECT TO COME OUT
OF THE SINO-SOVIET TALKS IN OSCOW?
DENG: I HAVE TALKED OVER THIS QUESTION ON MANY
OCCASIONS. WE HAVE NEVER OPPOSED NEGOTIATIONS.
FOR THE SINO-SOVIET NEGOTIATIONS, WE HOPE WE CAN
ACHIEVECERTAIN GOALS, BUT AT THE SAME TIME WE HAVEN'T
ANY ILLUSIONS REGARDING THIS MATTER. TAKE THE BORDER
TALKS. FOR EXAMPLE, JUST FOR ONE SIMPLE QUESTION,
SINCE 1969, WHEN SOVIET PREMIER KOSYGIN REACHED AN
AGREEMENT WITH ZHOU ENLAI IN BEIJING FOR TALKS ON
THE BORDER DISPUTE, THESE TALKS HAVE BEEN GOING ON
FOR ALMOST TEN YEARS, WITH NO RESULT AT ALL. SO, FOR
ONE SIMPLE BOUNDARY QUESTION THERE HAS BEEN NO
RESULT AT ALL.
AS FOR NEGOTIATIONS; THE CURRENT ONES CAN'T BE
LIMITED TO THE SIMPLE SCALE OF READJUSTING THIS
SECTOR OR THAT SECTOR OF THE BOUNDARY QUESTION WITH
THE SOVIET UNION. FOR THE CURRENT NEGOTIATIONS, IT
TOOK AROUND TEN DAYS FOR THETWO DELEGAIONS FROM
THE TWO COUTRIES--AND THAT IS A FAIRLY LONG TIME-TO PROCEED FROM PRELIMINARY NEGOTIATIONS TO THE
FORMAL NEGOTIATIONS STAGE. IT TOOK SUCH A LONG TIME

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
FOR THE PREPARATORY EFFORTS. SO, BOTH SIDES AGREED
THAT ANY QUESTION RAISED BY EITHER OF THE TWO PARTIES
CAN BE NEGOTIATED.
ON OUR SIDE, THE FIRST REQUEST PUT BY US THAT
THESE NEGOTIATIONS SHOLD PLACE EMPHASIS ON
REMOVING THE OBSTANCLES STANDING IN THE WAY OF
CONFIDENTIAL
PAGE 11

STATE 274506

NORMALIZATIONOF RELATIONS BETWEEN OUR TWO COUNTRIES.
BUT THIS IS A QUESTION COVERING A WIDE SCOPE. IN
A NUTSHELL, IT IS BETTER TO HAVE NEGOTIATIONS
THAN NOT TO HAVE NEGOTIATIONS. IT IS NECESSARY,
WHILE THE TALKS ARE GOING ON, TO WAIT AND SEE.
GOVERNOR: RAY: MR. VICE PREMIER, MY WIFE BILLY AND I
HAD THE GOOD FORTURE TO VISIT YOUR COUNTRY FIVE
YEARS AGO. WE HAVE SEEN CONSIDERABLE CHANGE IN THOSE
FIVE YEARS; MUCH CONSTRUCTION, CHANGES IN ATTITUDES.
PEOPLE ARE SPEAKING WITH US MUCH MORE FREELY. I
CERTAINLY AGREE WITH WHAT GOVERNOR SNELLING SAID
EARLIER ABOUT EHE GOALS YOU SET OUT BEING VERY
COMMENDABLE, AND I AM CURIOUS TO KNOW YOUR FORECAST:
IF WE RETURNED IN FIVE YEARS, WHAT WE WOULD SEE IN
TERMS OF CHANGE. WILL THERE BE CHANGES IN THE
PRODUCTIVITY OF PEOPLE POLLUTION CONTROL, THE GNP.
WHT DO YOU SEE IN TERMS OF CHANGE FIVE YEARS FROM NOW?
DENG: YOU SAID THAT YOU CAME IN 1974. AT THAT TIME,
THE GANG OF FOUR WAS (RUNNING) RAMPANT. AS SOON
AS WE HAD ENTERED ON THE CORRECT COURSE AND HAD DONE
A LITTLE BIT OF WORK, IN 1975 WE WERE REMOVED. ONLY
BY THE END OF 1976 WAS THE GANG OF FOUR SMASHED. IT
HAS BEEN ONLY THREE YEARS FROM THEIR OVERTHROW UNTIL
THE PRESENT. LIN BIAO AND THE GANG OF FOUR DURING
A DECADE OR MORE HAD BROUGHT ABOUT GREAT CHAOS TO OUR
ECONOMY. SO, AT THE MOMENT WE ARE MAKING READJUSTMENTS
OF THE ECONOMY; IT IS NECESSARY TO TAKE A LONG TIME
TO HEAL ALL THE WOUNDS. DURING THAT TIME THE SCHOLLS
AND UNIVERSITIES WERE ALL CLOSED. STUDENTS DIDN'T
GO TO SCHOLL. WE ARE NOW OPENING THE SCHOLLS AND
UNIVERSITIEWS. THE GANG OF FOUR IN THE ECONOMIC
FIELD BROUGHT ABOUT GREAT CHAOS EVERYWHERE AND SO,
ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT WAS DISPROPORTINONATE. THIS IS
WHY WE PLAN TO SPEND THREE YEARS, OR MAYBE EVEN FOUR
CONFIDENTIAL
PAGE 12

STATE 274506

YEARS, TO CARRY OUT READJUSTMENT OF THE ECONOMY.
SO, BY (THE END OF) THAT TIME MAY BE YOU WILL BE
ABLE TO SEE SOME CHANGEES. THERE WILL BE STUDENTS IN
PRIMARY, MIDDLE, AND HIGHER SCHOOLS STUDYING THEIR

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
LESSONS IN EARNEST, AND THIS WILL BE A GOOD THING
TO SEE.
REGARDING SCOAIL BEHAVOIR, ALTHOUGH PEOPLE
MIGHT SEE THAT THERE ARE STILL SOME PROBLEMS,
BASICALLY IT CAN BE SAID THAT THERE HAVE BEEN CHANGES.
THINGS ARE NOW VERY DIFFERENT FROM BEFORE. WE HAVE
OBSERVED CHANGES OF THE SAME KIND AS NOTED BY
GOVERNOR RAY, BUT WE CAN'T SAY WHETHER THESE CHANGES
ARE VERY BIG CHANGES.
IT CAN BE SAID WITH CERTAINTY THAT THE POLICY
AND LINES WE HAVE FORMULATED AFTER THE REMOVAL OF THE
GANG OF FOUR HAVE PROVEN MORE AND MORE CORRECT. BUT
AT THE SAME TIME MANY PROBLEMS HAD PILED UP. THIS
IS A VAST COUNTRY, AND THE PROBLEMS ARE NOT EASY TO
SOLVE. BUT WE ARE HOPEFUL. THERE WILL BE VERY BIG
CHANGES. WE BELIEVE THAT PEOLE ARE FULL OF
CONFIDENCE AND HOPE.
AS TO THE SO-CALLED DEMOCRACY WALL, SIT-INS AND
EMONSTRATIONS, THEY CANNOT REPRESENT THE GENUINE
FEELINGS OF OUR PEOPLE.
GOVERNOR ARIYOSHI: IN LISTENING TO THE REMARKS OF
THE VICE PREMIER, I DRTECT A MESSGE HERE THAT IN
OUR APPRAISALS OF MODERNIZATION WE SHOULD NOT JUDGE
BY THE STANDARDS OF THE UNITED STATES OR OTHER
COUNTRIES, BUT BY CHINESE STANDARDS.
DENG: RIGHT.
CONFIDENTIAL
PAGE 13

STATE 274506

ARIYOSHI: I FEEL VERY STRONGLY THAT THERE MUST BE
MUTUAL INTEREST IN EVERYTHING WE DO. MANY THINGS
HAPPEND IN A NATION, OR NOT HAPPEN, DEPENDING ON WHAT
HAPPENS IN EACH OF THE STATES. I THINK EACH OF THE
GOVERNORS HAVE DIFFERET THINGS GOING ON IN THEIR
STATES, AND EACH OF THEM HAVE CERTAIN STRENGTHS.
I HAPPEN TO COME FROM A STATE WHICH HAS GREATLY
DEVELOPED TOURISM.
DENG: JUST THE NUMBER OF TOURISTS IN YOUR STATE
ALONE MAY BE MORE THAN COME TO CHINA.
ARIYOSHI: I WOULD LKKE TO GO BACK HOME AND SEE
WHAT WE CAN DO TO HELP ON THIS MATTER. BBUT I WANT TO
BE SURE THAT THIS IS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE HOPES
AND ASPIRATIONS OF THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA.
DENG: WE MOST WELCOME THIS ATTITUDE.
ARIYOSHI: I WOULD REALLY LIKE TO PUSUE THE
ESTABISHMENT OF SOME WORKING MECHANISM, PERHAPS

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
INFORMALLY. WE CAN TALK ABOUT DETAILS AND GIVE
BACKGROUND IN SEPARATE MEETING LATER.
DENG: THIS WILL BE VERY GOOD.
DOAK BARNETT: I SHARE TH VIEW THAT THE PRESENT
PERIOD OF DEVELOPMENT IS VERY EXICITING AND PERHAPS
EVEN HISTORIC. AS I STUDY YOUR PRESENT POLICY, I
AM PARTICULARLY INTERESTED IN AND IMPRESSED BY YOUR
GOVERNMENT'S FLEXIBILITY IN TRYING TO MODIFY THE
STRUCTURE OF THE SYSTEM TO INCREASE PRODUCTIVITY AND
MAKE IT MORE EFFICIENT. IT SEEMS TO ME, AS AN
OUTSIDER OBSERVING, THAT IN MAMY RESPECTS YOUR
SUCCESS WILL DEPEND ON YOUR ABILITY TO HAVE FLEXIBILITY IN YOUR ECONOMIC SYSTEM; FOR INSTANCE, IN
CONFIDENTIAL
PAGE 14

STATE 274506

INCREASING INITIATIVE, THE ABILITY TO GIVE ENTERPRISES MORE DECISION MAKING POWER, PAYING GREATER
ATTENTION TO PRICING POLICY AND WHAT YOU CALL THE LAW
OF VALUE, IMPRVIING MANAGEMENT. WHAT ARE THE
DIFFICULTIES YOU ARE GOING TO ENCOUNTER IN CARRYING
OUT THESE NEW POLICIES? I WOULD THINK THAT THERE
ARE MANY PEOPLE IN THE STATE AND PARTY WHO ARE USED
TO THE OLD WAYS. HOW ARE YOU GOING TO GER THEM TO
ACCEPT THE NEW WAYS?
DENG: THIS QUESTION IS CORRECTLY RAISED, AND IS ALSO
A QUESTION TO WHICH WE ARE GIVING CONSIDERHATION.
FOR EXAMPLE, THE PRESENT PHENOMENON OF HAVING
TOO MANY PEOPLE DOING THE SAME JOB, SO THAT MANY
DON'T HAVE MUCH TO DO, CANNOT BE ASILY CORRECTED.
CURRENTLY, THE MOST IMPORTANT METHOD WE HAVE
ADOPTED IS BASED ON THE FOLLOWING: CHINA IS TOO
BIG A COUNTRY. WE ARE CARRYING OUT DECENTRALIZATION,
INCLUDING GIVING LARGE POWERS OF DECISION TO
ENTERPRISES SO THEY NATURALLY CAN FIND THEIR OWN
METHODS TO RATIONALIZE MANAGEMENT. EACH OF THE AREAS
CAN TRY THEIR BEST TO DEVELOP THEMSELVES, AND FIND
SOLUTIONS TO THEIR OWN PROBLEMS, BASED ON THEIR OWN
UNIQUE CONDITIONS AND ENVIRONMENTS. DURING THE LAST
TWO YEARS WE HAVE BEEN EXPERIMENTING ALONG THESE
LINES. EVERY EXPERIEMENT IN EVERY PLACE HAS BEEN
SUCCESSFUL. THIS HAS BEEN CONFIRMED. DURING THE
COMING TWO YEARS WE WILL MAKE THIS PART OF THE
SYSTEM.
SNELLING: APART FROM BEING A GOVERNOR, IN PRIVATE
LIFE I AM AN INDUSTRIALIST. THERE IS A FEELING THAT
CONFIDENTIAL
PAGE 15

STATE 274506

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014

THERE ARE LIMITS TO WHAT CAN BE DONE BY CAPITAL
INVESTMENT, THAT EVEN MORE IMPORTANT THAN EXPERIMENTATION BETWEEN REGIONS AND ENTERPRISES IS FINDING
A PLACE FOR INDIVUDIDUAL INITIATIVE AND REWARD.
WILL YOU BE WILLING TO EXPERIMENT WITH SYSTEMS
DNCOURAGING THE REWARD OF PRIVATE INITIATVE, IF THE
(INCREASED) PRODICTIVITY IS BENEFICIAL TO THE PRC;
AND PERHAPS GO SO FAR AS TO GIVE STEWARDSHIP--ALLOW
PRIVATE FAMILY OR INDIVIDUAL OPERATION IN SOME OF
THE COMMUNIES SO AS TO INCREASE PROEUCTION AND REDUCE
THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE REQUIED FOR PRODUCTION?
DENG: THERE IS ONE THING WHICH IS RIGHT. IT IS
IMPOSSIBLE TO GIVE PLAY TO PERSONAL ENTHUSIASM AND
INITIATIVE WITHOUT LINKING THIS TO PERSONAL INTEREST.
DURING THE PROCESS OF THE PAST TEN YEARS, FROM
EXPERIENCE, IT HAS BEEN PROVED THAT IN ALL THESE
ENTERPRISES WHICH WERE GIVEN LARGE POWERS OF DECISION,
THE WORKERS THEMSELVES HAVE INCREASED THEIR
INCOMES AND THE ENTERPRISES HAVE INCREASED THEIR
PRODUCTION AND GIVEN GREATER PROFITS TO THE
STATE. NOT ONLY IN THE FACTORIES, BUT IN THE COUNTRYSIDE AS WELL, THIS SITUATION WILL BE TRUE.
JUDGE: AS GOVERNORS OF SOVEREIGN STATES, WE ARE
INTERESTED IN KNOWING TO WHAT EXTENT DECENTRALIZATION
GIVES PROVINCIAL GOVERNORS THE POWER TO DECIDE TO
GIVE LOCAL LEADERS THE POWER TO DECIDE.
DENG: CHINA IS A SOCIALIST STATE WITH A PLANNED
ECONOMY FOLLOWING THE PRINCIPLE OF DEMOCRATIC
CENTRALIS. SO, GENERAL POLICIES--LARGE AND
IMPORTANT POLICIES AND LINES--WILL BE FORMULATED BY
THE STATE. IT WON'T DO NOT TO HAVE THE STATE
CONTROL PRICES OF COMMODITIES IN GENERAL. FOR
INSTANCE, IF THE STATE DIDN'T CONTROL PROCES, IF ANY
CONFIDENTIAL
PAGE 16

STATE 274506

PERSON COULD RAISE PRICES AT WILL, THIS COULD RAISE
PROBLEMS. IN THE PAST, WHILE WE HAVE HAD SHORTCOMINGS
43 7)58,&amp; *49. ,95 3,97&amp;#5 $3:3,54-)8&quot;-589,, WE HAVE
ALSO HAD SHORTCOMINGS RESULTING FROM NOT ENOUGHT
CENTRALIZATION. THE SITUATION VARIES FROM TRADE TO
TRADE; IT IS A VERY COMPLIATED PROBLEM.
MILLIKEN: (GIVES CLOSING REMARKS THANKING DENG, AGREEING
THAT CULTURAL, POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC TIES WILL
BE STRENGTHENED, AND WISHING DENG WELL IN CARRYING
OUT HIS HEAVY RESPONSIBILITIES.)

POSED TO DENG BY THE GOVERNORS AND AOAK BARNETT. A
TRANSCRIPT FOLLOWS:
4. BEGIN TEXT:
DENG: WELCOME, ALL OF YOU. DURING MY VISIT TO THE
UNITED STATES, I RECEIVED WARM HSOPITALITY FROM ALL
OF YOU, FOR WHICH I WISH TO EXPRESS MY DEEP THANKS.
WHEN I WAS IN THE UNITED STATES, ON ONE OCCASION
ALONE, AT ATLANTA, I WAS HONORED TO MEET SEVENTEEN
GOVERNORS. I UNDERSTAND THAT AMONG THEM ARE FIVE OF
YOU HERE NOW-SO WE ARE OLD FRIENDS.
GOVERNOR MILLIKEN (AFTER EXPRESSING GRATITUDE ON
CONFIDENTIAL
PAGE 03

STATE 274506

BEHALF OF THE GOVERNORS AND THEIR ENTOURAGE):
WE REMEMBER VERY WELL IN THE U.S YOUR HISTORIC VISIT
TO OUR COUNTRY. I HAVE BEEN ASKED BY AMBASSADOR
WOODCOCK ON BEHALF OF PRESIDENT CARTER TO
FORMALLY PRESENT TO YOU A PICTORIAL RECORD OF
YOUR VISIT TO THE UNITED STATES IN JANUARY. INCLUDED
IS A PICTURE OF YOUR VISIT WITH THE SEVENTEEN
GOVERNORS IN ATLANTA; AND, AS YOU NOTED IN YOUR
COMMENTS, FIVE OF THOSE GOVERNORS ARE HERE
TODAY. SO, IT GIVES ME GREAT PLEASURE ON BEHALF OF
AMBASSADOR WOODCOCK AND PRESIDENT CARTER TO PRESENT
YOU WITH THIS ALBUM.
DENG: THANK YOU. PLEASE CONVEY MY GREETINGS TO
PRESIDENT CARTER, AND ALSO MY GRATITUDE. MY STAY IN
THE U.S. WAS NOT A LONG ONE-ONLY ABOUT EIGHT DAYS.
BUT IT WAS A VERY PLEASANT ONE; IT LEFT ME WITH VERY
PLEASANT MEMORAIES. MAYBE MOST OF YOU HAVE COME FOR
THE FIRST TIME. OUR VISITS TO THE UNITED STATES AND
THE VISIT TO CHINA BY ALL OF YOU, INCLUDING VISITS
BY OTHER AMERICAN FRIENDS--EACH ONE OF THESE HAS BEEN
VERY BENEFICIAL FOR THE PROMOTION OF MUTUAL UNDERSTANDING
AND FRIENDLY RELATIONS BETWEEN OUR TWO COUNTRIES. BUT
OUR RECEIPTION GIVEN TO YOU MAY NOT BE AS GOOD AS THE
RECEIPTION GIVEN US, BECAUSE OUR CONDITIONS IN THE
PRC ARE NOT GOOD.
NOW, YOU HAVE ALRADY BEEN IN BEIJING THREEE
DAYS; YOU WILL ALSO BE VISITING OTHER PARTS OF CHINA?

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014

MILLIKEN: YES; WE WILL BE VISITING JIANAN N NANING,
AND SHANGHAI; AND THEN, AFTER THAT, WE ARE GOING TO
THAILAND TO SEE SOME REFUGEE CAMPS. WE ARE ALL
CONCERNED ABOUT THE PLIGHT OF THOSE REFUGEES. WE KNOW
THAT YOUR COUNTRY HAS BEEN VERY GENEROUS ABOUT
RECEIVING SOME OF THESE REFUGEES.
DENG: WE ALREADY HAVE RECEIVED MORE THAN 200,000.
CONFIDENTIAL
PAGE 04

STATE 274506

MILLIKEN: I KNOW THAT THE GOVERNORS HERE HAVE
QUESTIONS, AND IF I MAY, (I WILL) START OUT BY ASKING
A QUESTION ABOUT REFUGEES: WHAT IS GOING TO
BE THE ULTIMATE RESOLUTION OF THAT QUESTION, AND
WHAT ROLE WILL THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA PLAY
IN THAT RESOLUTION?
DENG: THE REASON FOR THECREATION OF REFUGEES MAINLY
IS DUE TO THE ATTACK BY VIETNAM INTO KAMPUCHEA. BUT
BEFORE THAT--OF COURSE, I'M NOT GOING TO COMMENT ON
THE POLICIES OF THE POL POT GOVERNMENT WHEN THAT
GOVERNMENT WAS IN POWER. AND, TO BE FRANK, WE DIDN'T
AGREE WITH SOME OF THOSE POLICIES; TO BE FRANK, SOME OF
THOSE POLICIES WERE NOT POPULAR. BUT AT THAT TIME,
AT LEAST THERE WERE NO REFUGEES; THERE WERE NO LARGE
NUMBERS OF PEOPLE BEING DRIVEN OUT OF THAT COUNTRY.
BUT NOW THE VIETNAMESE ATTACK HAS RESULTED IN THE
PEOPLE OF KAMPUCHEA FINDING IT DIFFICULT EVEN TO
LIVE, TO EXIST.
FIRST, THERE IS THE UNIVERSAL SITUATION OF
FAMINE, BECAUSE OF THE INABILITY (OF THE PEOPLE) TO
GO AHEAD WITH PRODUCTION. OF COURSE, THE EXODUS OF
A LARGE NUMBER OF REFUGEES TO A CERTAIN EXTENT HAS
BEEN THE RESULT OF THE POLICIES FOLLOWEDY BY POL POT.
BUT THE MAIN REASON FOR THIS PROBLEM IS THE RESULT
OF AGGRESSION AGAINST KAMPUCHEANS BY VIETNAMESE
TROOPS. SO, FOR A GENUINE SETTLEMENT IT IS
NECESSARY THAT THE WHOLE WORLD GIVE ASSISTANCE TOWARD
ACHIEVING A POLITICAL SETTLMENT. THE WHOLE WORLD
NEEDS TO GIVE MORAL HELP, MATERIAL HELPAND
POLITICAL HELP TO THE KAMPUCHEANS, TO FORCE
VIETNAME TO WITHDRAW FROM KAMPUCHEA; AND ONLY AFTER
CONFIDENTIAL
PAGE 05

STATE 274506

THAT IS DONE CAN THE PROBLEM BE SOLVED. NOW, IT IS
ALSO NECESSARY THAT HELP BE GIVEN TO THE PEOPLE OF
KAMPUCHEA, SOMETHING TO EAT AND MEDICAL AID. IT
IS ALSO VERY NECESSARY TO GIVE A FAIRLY GOOD
RESETTLEMENT OPPORTUNITY TO REFUGEES DRIVEN OUT OF

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
THE COUNTRY, AND TO GIVE THEM RELIEF. SO, IT IS A
GOOD THING THAT THE WORLD HAS TAKEN SOME MEASURES
INTERNATIONALLY IN THIS RESPECT. NOT ONLY REFUGEES
WHO HAVE COME OUT OF THE COUNTRY ARE IN A CONDITION
OF HUNGER; BUT ALSO INSIDE, AS WELL, A STATE OF WAR
HAS MEANT A HALT OF PRODUCTION; THERE ARE NO
COMMODITIES AVAILABLE AND THEREFORE THOSE INSIDE KAMPUCHEAA
ARE ALSO IN A VERY DIFFICULT POSITION. BUT THE
QUESTION IS -- THAT RELIEF GOODS MUST BE USED ON
VICTIMIZED REFUGEES THEMSELVES. THEY MUST NOT BE ALLOWED
TO FALL INTO THE HANDS OF EITHER THE VIETNAMESE OR
THE PUPPET REGIME OF HENG SAMRIN. WE'VE HAD THIS
EXPERIENCE IN THE PAST. WE GAVE A GREAT DEAL OF
ASSISTANCE TO VIETNAM. AND AT THE SAME TIME, DURING
WARTIME, WE WERE GIVING HELP TO KAMPUCHEA. BUT ALL
THINGS DESTINED FOR KAMPUCHEA HAD TO CROSS VIETNAM,
AND IN THE PROCESS VIETNAME KEPT THE GREATEST PART
FOR ITSELF; WHAT GOT TO THE KAMPUCHEAN SIDE WAS
VERY SMALL.
SO, THE BEST WAY IS TO FORCE VIETNAM TO COMMIT
ITSELF AND GUARANTEE THAT THESE THINGS WILL GO MOSTLY
TO KAMPUCHEANS; AND ALSO, FOR THE INTERNATIOAL
RELIEF ORGANIZATION PEOPLE TO GIVE THINGS DIRECTLY TO
THE PEOPLE INSIDE KAMPUCHEA. OTHERWISE, NOT ONLY
WILL THE GENUINELY-VICTIMIZED KAMPUCHEANS NOT BE ABLE
TO GER THESE THINGS; IN ADDITION, THESE MATERIALS
COULD BE TURNED INTO AID FOR THE VIETNAMESE
AGGRESSOR TROOPS. VIETNAME IS ALSO IN BAD SHAPE AND
NEEEDS THESE THINGS. SO, IF THEY GET THEM, THEY WILL
BE ENCOURAGED IN THEIR AGGRESSION. THE SAME
CONDITINS CAN ALSO BE APPLIED TO AREAS CONTROLLED

BY THE POL POT GOVERNMENT, AND THEY CAN BE ASKED TO
ACCEPT THESE CONDITIONS.
MILLIKEN: MANY OF OUR STATES ARE WORKING TOGETHER
ON THIS PROBLEM AND SETTLING MANY REFUGEES IN THEIR
STATES, MOST NOTABLY GOVERNOR RAY OF IOWA. WITH
YOUR APPROVAL, I WILL ASK EACH OF THE GOVERNORS TO
RAISE INDIVIDUAL PROBLEMS.
GOVERNOR ARIYOSHI: I WANT TO THE VICE PREMIER TO KNOW
THAT HAWAII HAD TAKEN IN BY MARCH OF THIS YEAR ONE
REFUGEE FOR EVERY 255 RESIDENTS.
GOVERNOR SNELLING: MR. VICE PREMIER, THE PEOPLE OF
THE UNITED STATES ARE EXICTED ABOUT YOUR PLANS TO
ACCELERATE TE PROGRESS OF THE FOUR MODERNIZATIONS
FOR CHINA-- EXCITED IN TERMS OF THE POTENTIAL
FOR THE CHINESE PEOPLE, EXCITED IN TERMS OF THE
SIGNIFICANCE FOR THE WORLD IN THE ACCELERATION OF THE

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
MODERNIZATION OF CHINA. BUT IT SEEMS TO US THAT
EVEN AT THE MAXIMUM RATE OF ACCELERATION, TO SUCCEED
AND BE DURABLE, THE PROCESS MAY TAKE SOME YEARS.
FRANKLY, SOME OF US WONDER HOW LONG YOU AND YOUR
ASSOCIATES HAVE TO DEMONSTRATE THAT YOUR PLAN-WHICH, BY THE WAY, WE THINK IS A VERY GOOD ONE-WILL SUCCEED?
(NOTE: THE CPIFA INTERPRETER, WHO SEEMED TO BE
IN DIFFICULTY THROUGHOUT THIS ESSSION, DID NOT
TRANSLATE THE LAST PART OF THIS QUESTION.)
DENG: ON THIS QUESTION OF THE FOUR MODERNIZATIONS
BEING PURSUED BY US WE HAVE EXPLAINED ON MANY
OCCASIONS, AND MADE IT CLEAR THAT WHEN WE TALK ABOUT
CONFIDENTIAL
PAGE 07

STATE 274506

THE FOUR MODERNIZATIONS THAT THIS MEANS THE FOUR
MODERNIZATIONS CHINESE STYLE. THE MOST OUTSTANDING CHARACTERISTICS OF CHINA ARE (AS FOLLOWS):
THE POPULATION IS BIG, TOO BIG. SO, EVEN IF WE ATTAIN
THE GOAL OF UPGRADING PRODUCTION T THE LEVELS WE
HAVE SET IN OUR TARGETS, EVEN IF WE ATTAIN THE GOALS
OF PRODUCING LOTS OF STEEL, VARIOUS KINDS OF INDUSTRIAL
PRODUCTS, AND FOOD GRAINS, OUR AVERAGE PER CAPITA
GNP WILL STILL NOT BE VERY HIGH COMPARED WITH MUCH OF
THE REST OF THE WORLD.
WE BELIEVE THAT THE MANS BY WHICH WE ARE
GOING TO MATERIALIZE OUR FOUR MODERNIZATIONS ARE
CORRECT. OUR POLICIES WE BELIEVE ARE CORRECT, INCLUDING
MAKING FULL USE OF ADVANCED FOREIGN TECHNOLOGY AND
FUNDS. IT IS ALSO IMPORTANT FOR CHINA TO EXPAND
ITS ECONOMIC EXCHANGE AND TRADE RELATIONS WITH THE
REST OF THE WORLD, FOR INSTANCE, IF IN OUR RELATIONS
WITH THE UNITED STATES, THE MOST FAVORED NATION
QUESTION CAN BE SETTLED IT CAN BE SAID WITH CERTAINTY
THAT THERE CAN BE A BETTER CHANCE FOR ECONOMIC
DEVELOPMENT AND TRADE TIES WITH THE U.S. A QUESTION
OF THE SAME NATURE IS, THAT IN REQUESTING THAT CHINA
BE GIVEN MOST FAVORED NATION STATUS, WE HAVE NOT
SOLVED THIS PROBLEM YET IN EUROPE AND JAPAN; THUS, IT
IS NECESSARY TO NEGOTIATE WITH THEM TO SOLVE THIS
PROBLEM. SO, WITHOUT THIS CONDITION (MFN STATUS),
EVEN IF WE IMPORTED FOREIGN TECHNOLOGY AND FUNDS,
WE WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO PAY IT ALL BACK.
CONSEQUENTLY, IN ORDER TO SOLVE THE PRLBLEM OF
REPAYMENT CAPABILITY AND ALSO SPEED UP THE
DEVELOPMENT OF THE CHINESE ECONOMY, WE HAVE PLANS TO
ADOPT MORE JOINT VENTURES. FOR EXAMPLE, SOME OF THE
AMERICAN OIL COMPANIES ARE PROSPECTING IN THE SOUTH
CHINA SEA. IF THE SURVEYS HAVE TURNED OUT FAVORABLY
AND THERE ARE INDICATIONS THAT (THE RESOURCES) ARE
WORTH EXPLOITING, IT CAN BE SAID WITH FULL

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
CONFIDENTIAL
PAGE 08

STATE 274506

ASSURANCE THAT JOINT VENTURES WITH FOREIGN COMPANIES
CAN BE INCLUDED--EITHER JOINT VENTURES OR PAYMENT BY
COMPENSATORY TRADE CAN BE UNDERTAKEN, AND THIS
DOESN'T ENTAIL THE PROBLEM OF REPAYMENT.
CHINA IS VERY RICH IN NATURAL RESOURCES,
ESPEICALLY NOFERROUS, RARE METALS. FOR INSTANCE,
TITANIUM; IT IS SAID THAT TO BUILD ONE BOEING 747
'JET AIRCRAFT) REQUIRES TWO TONS OF TITANIUM,
OF WHICH WE HAVE A LOT. SO, IN SOME AREAS,THIS
METHOD OF INTRODUCTION OF TECHNOLOGY AND FUNDS FROM
DEVELOPED COUNTRIES--IN SOME AREAS AND FROM SOME
COUNTRIES--CAN TAKE THE FORM OF JOINT VENTURES OR
POOLING CAPITAL AND RUNNING ENTERPRISES TOGETHER,
BECAUSE THIS KIND OF PROJECT HAS AN INHERENT METHOD
OF REPAYMENT. IN NEGOTIATIONS WITH SOME OF THESE
COUNTRIES AT THE MOMENT, WE HAVE MET ONE PROBLEM.
THESE COUNTRES ASK THAT PRODUCTS BE SOLD MAINLY TO
THE CHINESE INTERNALMARKET. BUT WITH REGARD TO
THIS QUESTION OF THE CHINESE DOMESTIC MARKET; SURELY,
IT IS POTENTIALLY A VERY BIG ONE. BUT ONLY AFTER
CHINA IS A BIT BETTER OFF, AFTER SOME YEARS. IN THE
NEAR FUTURE IT IS DIFFICULT FOR THIS TO BE TRUE.
WHAT WE WANT AT THE MOMENT, WHEN WE SAY JOINT
VENTURE AND COMPENSATORY TRADE, IS THAT THESE THINGS
SHOULD BE SOLD TO THE INTERNATIONAL MARKET. THIS CAN
SOLVE THE PROBLEM OF REPAYMENT. IT CAN BRING IN
MONEY, WHICH WE WANT, TO CHINA. AND SOME DOMESTIC
MARKET INSIDE CHINA CAN GRADUALLY BE DEVELOPED.
WITHOUT THIS STAGE, IT DON'T DO.
APART FROM THIS, WHAT WE ARE GOING TO DO IS AS
FOLLOWS: WE SHOLD LEARN TO HANDLE THE NEW
TECHNOLOGY WE ABSORB, AND ALSO MANAGEMENT. IN BOTH
FIELDS WE ARE BACKWARDS, SO WE ARE GOING TO MAKE AN
CONFIDENTIAL
PAGE 09

STATE 274506

EFFORT TO SOLVE THESE PROBLEMS.
GOVERNOR QUIE: LET ME ASK ABOUT IMPROVEMENT OF
MANAGEMENT SKILLS AND TECHNIQUES; AND LET ME ADD
ANOTHER ONE--AND I HOPE I DON'T OFFEND--THAT IS,
THE WORK ETHIC AND PRODUCTIVITY: HOW WILL YOU TRAIN
SCIENTISTS AND MANAGERS, AND WHAT WILL YOU GIVE
PEOPLE TO GETTHEM TO BELIEVE SO THAT THEY WILL
WORK HARDER?
DENG: AS YOU KNOW, IN CHINA WE HAVE SUFFERED FROM
A TEN-YEAR GAP WHEN WE DID NOT PRDUCE PEOPLE WITH
SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL SKILLS. SO, WE SAY WE HAVE

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
LOST ONE GENERATION. NOT ONLY IS THERE A LACK OF
TECHNICAL PERSONNEL, BUT PARTICULARLY, OF MANAGEMENT
PERSONNEL. CONSEQUENTLY, WE ARE GOING TO MAKE
UP THIS SIDE. SO, IN THIS RESPECT WE ARE GOING TO LEARN
FROM ADVANCED COUNTRIES NOT ONLY TECHNICAL KNOWLEDGE,
BUT ALSO BASIC MANAGEMENT SKILLS.
QUIE: LLET ME ADD THAT IN THE UNITED STATES OUR
POPULATION OF YOUNG PEOPLE IS SUCH THAT DURING THE
NINETTEN EIGHTIES WE WON'T HAVE AS MANY STUDENTS IN
SCHOOL AS IN THE NINETTEN SEVENTIES. SO, THIS IS
AN OPPORTUNITY FOR YOU TO SEND YOUR STUDENTS TO
STUDY IN OUR SCHOOLS. I AM HAPPY TO SAY THAT THE
UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA HAS WORKED OUT A STUDENT
EXCHANGE PROGRAM, AND SO HAVE OTHER INSTITUTIONS.
DENG: WORK IS BEING DONE RIGHT NOW ON THIS. BUT
THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS CANNOT BE INCREASED ALL OF
A SUDDEN BY LARGE NUMBERS USUALLY, IT IS MORE
BENEFICIAL AND PROPER TO SEND POST-GRADUATESTUDENTS
TO POST-GRADUATE INSTITUTIONS IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES.
BUT FOR THIS KIND OF STUDENT IT IS DIFFICULT TO
FIND THEM AT THE MOMENT AND THERE IS THE HANDICAP
CONFIDENTIAL
PAGE 10

STATE 274506

THAT THEY DO NOT KNOW FOREIGN LANGUAGES WELL ENOUGH.
GOVERNOR JUDGE: IN LIGHT OF THE MANY STRONG STATEMENTS THE CHAIRMAN (HUA) MADE IN PARIS ON THE SUBJECT
OF SOVIET AGGRESSION, WHAT DO YOU EXPECT TO COME OUT
OF THE SINO-SOVIET TALKS IN OSCOW?
DENG: I HAVE TALKED OVER THIS QUESTION ON MANY
OCCASIONS. WE HAVE NEVER OPPOSED NEGOTIATIONS.
FOR THE SINO-SOVIET NEGOTIATIONS, WE HOPE WE CAN
ACHIEVECERTAIN GOALS, BUT AT THE SAME TIME WE HAVEN'T
ANY ILLUSIONS REGARDING THIS MATTER. TAKE THE BORDER
TALKS. FOR EXAMPLE, JUST FOR ONE SIMPLE QUESTION,
SINCE 1969, WHEN SOVIET PREMIER KOSYGIN REACHED AN
AGREEMENT WITH ZHOU ENLAI IN BEIJING FOR TALKS ON
THE BORDER DISPUTE, THESE TALKS HAVE BEEN GOING ON
FOR ALMOST TEN YEARS, WITH NO RESULT AT ALL. SO, FOR
ONE SIMPLE BOUNDARY QUESTION THERE HAS BEEN NO
RESULT AT ALL.
AS FOR NEGOTIATIONS; THE CURRENT ONES CAN'T BE
LIMITED TO THE SIMPLE SCALE OF READJUSTING THIS
SECTOR OR THAT SECTOR OF THE BOUNDARY QUESTION WITH
THE SOVIET UNION. FOR THE CURRENT NEGOTIATIONS, IT
TOOK AROUND TEN DAYS FOR THETWO DELEGAIONS FROM
THE TWO COUTRIES--AND THAT IS A FAIRLY LONG TIME-TO PROCEED FROM PRELIMINARY NEGOTIATIONS TO THE
FORMAL NEGOTIATIONS STAGE. IT TOOK SUCH A LONG TIME

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
FOR THE PREPARATORY EFFORTS. SO, BOTH SIDES AGREED
THAT ANY QUESTION RAISED BY EITHER OF THE TWO PARTIES
CAN BE NEGOTIATED.
ON OUR SIDE, THE FIRST REQUEST PUT BY US THAT
THESE NEGOTIATIONS SHOLD PLACE EMPHASIS ON
REMOVING THE OBSTANCLES STANDING IN THE WAY OF
CONFIDENTIAL
PAGE 11

STATE 274506

NORMALIZATIONOF RELATIONS BETWEEN OUR TWO COUNTRIES.
BUT THIS IS A QUESTION COVERING A WIDE SCOPE. IN
A NUTSHELL, IT IS BETTER TO HAVE NEGOTIATIONS
THAN NOT TO HAVE NEGOTIATIONS. IT IS NECESSARY,
WHILE THE TALKS ARE GOING ON, TO WAIT AND SEE.
GOVERNOR: RAY: MR. VICE PREMIER, MY WIFE BILLY AND I
HAD THE GOOD FORTURE TO VISIT YOUR COUNTRY FIVE
YEARS AGO. WE HAVE SEEN CONSIDERABLE CHANGE IN THOSE
FIVE YEARS; MUCH CONSTRUCTION, CHANGES IN ATTITUDES.
PEOPLE ARE SPEAKING WITH US MUCH MORE FREELY. I
CERTAINLY AGREE WITH WHAT GOVERNOR SNELLING SAID
EARLIER ABOUT EHE GOALS YOU SET OUT BEING VERY
COMMENDABLE, AND I AM CURIOUS TO KNOW YOUR FORECAST:
IF WE RETURNED IN FIVE YEARS, WHAT WE WOULD SEE IN
TERMS OF CHANGE. WILL THERE BE CHANGES IN THE
PRODUCTIVITY OF PEOPLE POLLUTION CONTROL, THE GNP.
WHT DO YOU SEE IN TERMS OF CHANGE FIVE YEARS FROM NOW?
DENG: YOU SAID THAT YOU CAME IN 1974. AT THAT TIME,
THE GANG OF FOUR WAS (RUNNING) RAMPANT. AS SOON
AS WE HAD ENTERED ON THE CORRECT COURSE AND HAD DONE
A LITTLE BIT OF WORK, IN 1975 WE WERE REMOVED. ONLY
BY THE END OF 1976 WAS THE GANG OF FOUR SMASHED. IT
HAS BEEN ONLY THREE YEARS FROM THEIR OVERTHROW UNTIL
THE PRESENT. LIN BIAO AND THE GANG OF FOUR DURING
A DECADE OR MORE HAD BROUGHT ABOUT GREAT CHAOS TO OUR
ECONOMY. SO, AT THE MOMENT WE ARE MAKING READJUSTMENTS
OF THE ECONOMY; IT IS NECESSARY TO TAKE A LONG TIME
TO HEAL ALL THE WOUNDS. DURING THAT TIME THE SCHOLLS
AND UNIVERSITIES WERE ALL CLOSED. STUDENTS DIDN'T
GO TO SCHOLL. WE ARE NOW OPENING THE SCHOLLS AND
UNIVERSITIEWS. THE GANG OF FOUR IN THE ECONOMIC
FIELD BROUGHT ABOUT GREAT CHAOS EVERYWHERE AND SO,
ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT WAS DISPROPORTINONATE. THIS IS
WHY WE PLAN TO SPEND THREE YEARS, OR MAYBE EVEN FOUR
CONFIDENTIAL
PAGE 12

STATE 274506

YEARS, TO CARRY OUT READJUSTMENT OF THE ECONOMY.
SO, BY (THE END OF) THAT TIME MAY BE YOU WILL BE
ABLE TO SEE SOME CHANGEES. THERE WILL BE STUDENTS IN
PRIMARY, MIDDLE, AND HIGHER SCHOOLS STUDYING THEIR

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
LESSONS IN EARNEST, AND THIS WILL BE A GOOD THING
TO SEE.
REGARDING SCOAIL BEHAVOIR, ALTHOUGH PEOPLE
MIGHT SEE THAT THERE ARE STILL SOME PROBLEMS,
BASICALLY IT CAN BE SAID THAT THERE HAVE BEEN CHANGES.
THINGS ARE NOW VERY DIFFERENT FROM BEFORE. WE HAVE
OBSERVED CHANGES OF THE SAME KIND AS NOTED BY
GOVERNOR RAY, BUT WE CAN'T SAY WHETHER THESE CHANGES
ARE VERY BIG CHANGES.
IT CAN BE SAID WITH CERTAINTY THAT THE POLICY
AND LINES WE HAVE FORMULATED AFTER THE REMOVAL OF THE
GANG OF FOUR HAVE PROVEN MORE AND MORE CORRECT. BUT
AT THE SAME TIME MANY PROBLEMS HAD PILED UP. THIS
IS A VAST COUNTRY, AND THE PROBLEMS ARE NOT EASY TO
SOLVE. BUT WE ARE HOPEFUL. THERE WILL BE VERY BIG
CHANGES. WE BELIEVE THAT PEOLE ARE FULL OF
CONFIDENCE AND HOPE.
AS TO THE SO-CALLED DEMOCRACY WALL, SIT-INS AND
EMONSTRATIONS, THEY CANNOT REPRESENT THE GENUINE
FEELINGS OF OUR PEOPLE.
GOVERNOR ARIYOSHI: IN LISTENING TO THE REMARKS OF
THE VICE PREMIER, I DRTECT A MESSGE HERE THAT IN
OUR APPRAISALS OF MODERNIZATION WE SHOULD NOT JUDGE
BY THE STANDARDS OF THE UNITED STATES OR OTHER
COUNTRIES, BUT BY CHINESE STANDARDS.
DENG: RIGHT.
CONFIDENTIAL
PAGE 13

STATE 274506

ARIYOSHI: I FEEL VERY STRONGLY THAT THERE MUST BE
MUTUAL INTEREST IN EVERYTHING WE DO. MANY THINGS
HAPPEND IN A NATION, OR NOT HAPPEN, DEPENDING ON WHAT
HAPPENS IN EACH OF THE STATES. I THINK EACH OF THE
GOVERNORS HAVE DIFFERET THINGS GOING ON IN THEIR
STATES, AND EACH OF THEM HAVE CERTAIN STRENGTHS.
I HAPPEN TO COME FROM A STATE WHICH HAS GREATLY
DEVELOPED TOURISM.
DENG: JUST THE NUMBER OF TOURISTS IN YOUR STATE
ALONE MAY BE MORE THAN COME TO CHINA.
ARIYOSHI: I WOULD LKKE TO GO BACK HOME AND SEE
WHAT WE CAN DO TO HELP ON THIS MATTER. BBUT I WANT TO
BE SURE THAT THIS IS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE HOPES
AND ASPIRATIONS OF THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA.
DENG: WE MOST WELCOME THIS ATTITUDE.
ARIYOSHI: I WOULD REALLY LIKE TO PUSUE THE
ESTABISHMENT OF SOME WORKING MECHANISM, PERHAPS

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
INFORMALLY. WE CAN TALK ABOUT DETAILS AND GIVE
BACKGROUND IN SEPARATE MEETING LATER.
DENG: THIS WILL BE VERY GOOD.
DOAK BARNETT: I SHARE TH VIEW THAT THE PRESENT
PERIOD OF DEVELOPMENT IS VERY EXICITING AND PERHAPS
EVEN HISTORIC. AS I STUDY YOUR PRESENT POLICY, I
AM PARTICULARLY INTERESTED IN AND IMPRESSED BY YOUR
GOVERNMENT'S FLEXIBILITY IN TRYING TO MODIFY THE
STRUCTURE OF THE SYSTEM TO INCREASE PRODUCTIVITY AND
MAKE IT MORE EFFICIENT. IT SEEMS TO ME, AS AN
OUTSIDER OBSERVING, THAT IN MAMY RESPECTS YOUR
SUCCESS WILL DEPEND ON YOUR ABILITY TO HAVE FLEXIBILITY IN YOUR ECONOMIC SYSTEM; FOR INSTANCE, IN
CONFIDENTIAL
PAGE 14

STATE 274506

INCREASING INITIATIVE, THE ABILITY TO GIVE ENTERPRISES MORE DECISION MAKING POWER, PAYING GREATER
ATTENTION TO PRICING POLICY AND WHAT YOU CALL THE LAW
OF VALUE, IMPRVIING MANAGEMENT. WHAT ARE THE
DIFFICULTIES YOU ARE GOING TO ENCOUNTER IN CARRYING
OUT THESE NEW POLICIES? I WOULD THINK THAT THERE
ARE MANY PEOPLE IN THE STATE AND PARTY WHO ARE USED
TO THE OLD WAYS. HOW ARE YOU GOING TO GER THEM TO
ACCEPT THE NEW WAYS?
DENG: THIS QUESTION IS CORRECTLY RAISED, AND IS ALSO
A QUESTION TO WHICH WE ARE GIVING CONSIDERHATION.
FOR EXAMPLE, THE PRESENT PHENOMENON OF HAVING
TOO MANY PEOPLE DOING THE SAME JOB, SO THAT MANY
DON'T HAVE MUCH TO DO, CANNOT BE ASILY CORRECTED.
CURRENTLY, THE MOST IMPORTANT METHOD WE HAVE
ADOPTED IS BASED ON THE FOLLOWING: CHINA IS TOO
BIG A COUNTRY. WE ARE CARRYING OUT DECENTRALIZATION,
INCLUDING GIVING LARGE POWERS OF DECISION TO
ENTERPRISES SO THEY NATURALLY CAN FIND THEIR OWN
METHODS TO RATIONALIZE MANAGEMENT. EACH OF THE AREAS
CAN TRY THEIR BEST TO DEVELOP THEMSELVES, AND FIND
SOLUTIONS TO THEIR OWN PROBLEMS, BASED ON THEIR OWN
UNIQUE CONDITIONS AND ENVIRONMENTS. DURING THE LAST
TWO YEARS WE HAVE BEEN EXPERIMENTING ALONG THESE
LINES. EVERY EXPERIEMENT IN EVERY PLACE HAS BEEN
SUCCESSFUL. THIS HAS BEEN CONFIRMED. DURING THE
COMING TWO YEARS WE WILL MAKE THIS PART OF THE
SYSTEM.
SNELLING: APART FROM BEING A GOVERNOR, IN PRIVATE
LIFE I AM AN INDUSTRIALIST. THERE IS A FEELING THAT
CONFIDENTIAL
PAGE 15

STATE 274506

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014

THERE ARE LIMITS TO WHAT CAN BE DONE BY CAPITAL
INVESTMENT, THAT EVEN MORE IMPORTANT THAN EXPERIMENTATION BETWEEN REGIONS AND ENTERPRISES IS FINDING
A PLACE FOR INDIVUDIDUAL INITIATIVE AND REWARD.
WILL YOU BE WILLING TO EXPERIMENT WITH SYSTEMS
DNCOURAGING THE REWARD OF PRIVATE INITIATVE, IF THE
(INCREASED) PRODICTIVITY IS BENEFICIAL TO THE PRC;
AND PERHAPS GO SO FAR AS TO GIVE STEWARDSHIP--ALLOW
PRIVATE FAMILY OR INDIVIDUAL OPERATION IN SOME OF
THE COMMUNIES SO AS TO INCREASE PROEUCTION AND REDUCE
THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE REQUIED FOR PRODUCTION?
DENG: THERE IS ONE THING WHICH IS RIGHT. IT IS
IMPOSSIBLE TO GIVE PLAY TO PERSONAL ENTHUSIASM AND
INITIATIVE WITHOUT LINKING THIS TO PERSONAL INTEREST.
DURING THE PROCESS OF THE PAST TEN YEARS, FROM
EXPERIENCE, IT HAS BEEN PROVED THAT IN ALL THESE
ENTERPRISES WHICH WERE GIVEN LARGE POWERS OF DECISION,
THE WORKERS THEMSELVES HAVE INCREASED THEIR
INCOMES AND THE ENTERPRISES HAVE INCREASED THEIR
PRODUCTION AND GIVEN GREATER PROFITS TO THE
STATE. NOT ONLY IN THE FACTORIES, BUT IN THE COUNTRYSIDE AS WELL, THIS SITUATION WILL BE TRUE.
JUDGE: AS GOVERNORS OF SOVEREIGN STATES, WE ARE
INTERESTED IN KNOWING TO WHAT EXTENT DECENTRALIZATION
GIVES PROVINCIAL GOVERNORS THE POWER TO DECIDE TO
GIVE LOCAL LEADERS THE POWER TO DECIDE.
DENG: CHINA IS A SOCIALIST STATE WITH A PLANNED
ECONOMY FOLLOWING THE PRINCIPLE OF DEMOCRATIC
CENTRALIS. SO, GENERAL POLICIES--LARGE AND
IMPORTANT POLICIES AND LINES--WILL BE FORMULATED BY
THE STATE. IT WON'T DO NOT TO HAVE THE STATE
CONTROL PRICES OF COMMODITIES IN GENERAL. FOR
INSTANCE, IF THE STATE DIDN'T CONTROL PROCES, IF ANY
CONFIDENTIAL
PAGE 16

STATE 274506

PERSON COULD RAISE PRICES AT WILL, THIS COULD RAISE
PROBLEMS. IN THE PAST, WHILE WE HAVE HAD SHORTCOMINGS
43 7)58,&amp; *49. ,95 3,97&amp;#5 $3:3,54-)8&quot;-589,, WE HAVE
ALSO HAD SHORTCOMINGS RESULTING FROM NOT ENOUGHT
CENTRALIZATION. THE SITUATION VARIES FROM TRADE TO
TRADE; IT IS A VERY COMPLIATED PROBLEM.
MILLIKEN: (GIVES CLOSING REMARKS THANKING DENG, AGREEING
THAT CULTURAL, POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC TIES WILL
BE STRENGTHENED, AND WISHING DENG WELL IN CARRYING
OUT HIS HEAVY RESPONSIBILITIES.)
DENG: AT LEAST, THIS WILL BE BENERICIAL TO US IN
