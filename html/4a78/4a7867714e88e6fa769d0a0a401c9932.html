		<h3>Tor</h3>
		<p><a href="https://www.torproject.org">Tor</a> is an encrypted anonymising network that makes it harder to intercept internet communications, or see where communications are coming from or going to.</p>
		<p>In order to use the WikiLeaks public submission system as detailed above you can download the Tor Browser Bundle, which is a Firefox-like browser available for Windows, Mac OS X and GNU/Linux and pre-configured to connect using the anonymising system Tor.</p>
		<h4>Tails</h4>
		<p>If you are at high risk and you have the capacity to do so, you can also access the submission system through a secure operating system called <a href="https://tails.boum.org">Tails</a>. Tails is an operating system launched from a USB stick or a DVD that aim to leaves no traces when the computer is shut down after use and automatically routes your internet traffic through Tor. Tails will require you to have either a USB stick or a DVD at least 4GB big and a laptop or desktop computer.</p>

		<h3>Tips</h3>
		<p>Our submission system works hard to preserve your anonymity, but we recommend you also take some of your own precautions. Please review these basic guidelines. </p>
		<div>
			<h4>1. Contact us if you have specific problems</h4>
			<p>If you have a very large submission, or a submission with a complex format, or are a high-risk source, please <a href="#submit_help_contact">contact us</a>. In our experience it is always possible to find a custom solution for even the most seemingly difficult situations.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h4>2. What computer to use</h4>
			<p>If the computer you are uploading from could subsequently be audited in an investigation, consider using a computer that is not easily tied to you. Technical users can also use <a href="https://tails.boum.org">Tails</a> to help ensure you do not leave any records of your submission on the computer.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h4>3. Do not talk about your submission to others</h4>
			<p>If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in source protection – it is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This includes other media organisations.</p>
		</div>

	</div>
</div>

<div id="submit_help_after" class="submit_elem">

			</div>
		</div>

		<h3>After</h3>

		<div>
			<h4>1. Do not talk about your submission to others</h4>
			<p>If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in source protection – it is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This includes other media organisations.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h4>2. Act normal</h4>
			<p>If you are a high-risk source, avoid saying anything or doing anything after submitting which might promote suspicion. In particular, you should try to stick to your normal routine and behaviour.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h4>3. Remove traces of your submission</h4>
			<p>If you are a high-risk source and the computer you prepared your submission on, or uploaded it from, could subsequently be audited in an investigation, we recommend that you format and dispose of the computer hard drive and any other storage media you used.</p>
			<p>In particular, hard drives retain data after formatting which may be visible to a digital forensics team and flash media (USB sticks, memory cards and SSD drives) retain data even after a secure erasure. If you used flash media to store sensitive data, it is important to destroy the media.</p>
			<p>If you do this and are a high-risk source you should make sure there are no traces of the clean-up, since such traces themselves may draw suspicion.</p>
			<div>
				<h4>4. If you face legal action</h4>
				<p>If a legal action is brought against you as a result of your submission, there are organisations that may help you. The Courage Foundation is an international organisation dedicated to the protection of journalistic sources. You can find more details at <a href="https://www.couragefound.org">https://www.couragefound.org</a>.</p>

		<p>WikiLeaks publishes documents of political or historical importance that are censored or otherwise suppressed. We specialise in strategic global publishing and large archives.</p>
		<p>The following is the address of our secure site where you can anonymously upload your documents to WikiLeaks editors. You can only access this submissions system through Tor. (See our <a href="#submit_help_tor">Tor tab</a> for more information.) We also advise you to read our <a href="#submit_help_tips">tips for sources</a> before submitting.</p>

         China Political Memo: The Qing Dynasty Revisited<br />
<br />
         [Teaser:]<br />
<br />
         Economic reform in China in recent years has resulted in a vibrant<br />
         business environment, but it is far from a level playing field.<br />
         While many of the country's state-owned enterprises (SOEs) are<br />
         reporting soaring profits, small to medium-sized private enterprises<br />
         (SMEs) are reportedly experiencing &lt;link nid=&quot;197702&quot;&gt;serious<br />
         financial woes&lt;/link&gt;. This not only has rekindled an old debate<br />
         about private entities being squeezed out by SOEs and the state, it<br />
         has also prompted a new debate over whether this particular path to<br />
         economic reform is viable for China.a*&quot;<br />
<br />
         In an attempt to defuse the debate, the government repeatedly has<br />
         cited official numbers that show a different picture. According to<br />
         the National Statistic Bureau (NBS), the number of a**scaleda** SOEs<br />
         (those with revenues of at least 5 million yuan), the amount of<br />
         their profits and their employee head counts declined from 2005 to<br />
         2009, 4.7 percent, 26.9 percent and 20.4 percent respectively. NBS<br />
         figures show that for SMEs during that period, the same metrics rose<br />
         58.9 percent, 28 percent and 33.7 percent.<br />
<br />
         While it is true that the number of private firms listed among<br />
         Chinaa**s top 500 enterprises increased from 13 to 184 from 2010 to<br />
         2011, they fell further behind SOEs in terms of revenues and<br />
         profits. Total revenues and profits for private enterprises account<br />
         for only about 15 percent of the total listed and do not exceed the<br />
         total revenues and profits of the top 10 enterprises on the list,<br />
         all SOEs. Still, even these numbers do not tell the whole<br />
         story.a*&quot;a*&quot;Reacting to the Recession<br />
<br />
         The current problem is largely the result of the governmenta**s<br />
         effort to overcome the 2008 financial crisis, when most of Beijing's<br />
         stimulus funds flowed into government-led investments. Already hit<br />
         hard by the global downturn were many manufacturing and<br />
         export-oriented SMEs due to the diminishing demand for their<br />
         products. At the same time, many SOEs began to enjoy highly<br />
         favorable policies and subsidies that significantly boosted their<br />
         economic performance. For some, in industries such as oil,<br />
         telecommunications and rail, these policies strengthened their<br />
         positions as monopolies. For others, the policies enabled them to<br />
         enter industries that previously had been dominated by private<br />
         enterprises, such as construction, services and real estate. This<br />
         resulted in a distinct disadvantage for private enterprises, which<br />
         had to compete against government-supported SOEs for market share<br />
         and financing. a*&quot;a*&quot;<br />
<br />
         Under the tightened policy environment and rising costs of 2011,<br />
         financing has become critically important for all enterprises, SOEs<br />
         and private enterprises alike, so the competition has become even<br />
         more intense. Small to medium-sized private enterprises that were<br />
         already more vulnerable to the state's macro-economic policies are<br />
         going head-to-head with state-owned counterparts for a limited loan<br />
         pool. For the most part, state banks are opting to lend to SOEs,<br />
         which have political connections and a greater capability to repay<br />
         the loans, due in large part to state support if they default. This<br />
         has driven more and more private enterprises to informal private<br />
         lending and intertwined capital chains that have placed a greater<br />
         financial burden on SMEs. Official statistics are very vague<br />
         concerning SMEs bankruptcies, but local reports indicate they are<br />
         increasing and affecting local economies.<br />
<br />
         Underlying Problems<br />
<br />
         But the problems for Chinaa**s SMEs go far deeper than the 2008<br />
         financial crisis.<br />
         Private enterprises emerged in Chinaa**s state-planned economy in<br />
         the early 1980s during Chinaa**s a**Opening Upa** under Deng<br />
         Xiaoping. Many SMEs originated as family- or township-village<br />
         factories, made possible in large part by the availability of<br />
         surplus rural labor as large swaths of the countryside were<br />
         urbanized. More focused on local markets, these SMEs contributed to<br />
         local economies and individual wealth.<br />
<br />
         The process intensified in 1992 when market-oriented policies<br />
         cleared various legal and ideological hurdles. Between 1989 and 1992<br />
         an ideological struggle ensued over whether the government should<br />
         allow the private sector to grow. Deng finally proclaimed that the<br />
         government did not favor one sector over the other. As long as it<br />
         boosted the Chinese economy with employment and revenues the<br />
         government would support it. a*&quot;a*&quot;<br />
<br />
         Viewing the export sector as a critical pillar of economic growth,<br />
         Beijing encouraged SMEs to broaden their market focus, and many<br />
         engaged in low-end and labor-intensive manufacturing. Meanwhile, new<br />
         tax laws in 1994 gave more autonomy to local governments and a<br />
         greater percentage of local revenues to the central government,<br />
         prompting local governments to promote private enterprises in order<br />
         to sustain their income streams. During this time, Chinaa**s SMEs<br />
         flourished as did a large number of entrepreneurs.<br />
<br />
         a*&quot;a*&quot;They continued to do so throughout the 1990s, even as the<br />
         central government restructured SOEs in the mid-1990s, consolidating<br />
         the weaker ones and giving SOEs greater financial and political<br />
         support. Clearly delineating certain boundaries between SOEs and<br />
         SMEs, the government made sure that the rising status of SOEs in the<br />
         country's economy did not hamper the growth of SMEs. Still, the<br />
         state's concern over private enterprises being outside of Beijing's<br />
         political control never eased. It seemed that the more people<br />
         private enterprises employed and the more these enterprises<br />
         contributed to the economy the more fearful the government became.<br />
<br />
         Then in 2004, Beijing stopped construction of a locally approved<br />
         project by Jiangsu Tieben Steel, a private iron and steel company in<br />
         Jiangsu province, for violating environmental protection laws and<br />
         state industrial policies. In the governmenta**s eyes, the real<br />
         problem was the expansion of Tieben and other private enterprises<br />
         and the support they were receiving by local governments. This<br />
         marked a turning point in the development of private enterprise in<br />
         China. Since then, Beijing has gradually reduced its support to<br />
         private enterprises and shifted its attention to state-owned<br />
         entities that it could more directly control.<br />
<br />
         Along with a reduction in financial support for private enterprises<br />
         came a tightening of regulations and an increasingly &lt;link<br />
         nid=&quot;198422&quot;&gt;complex connection between political elites and<br />
         business elites &lt;/link&gt;, all culminated in the outpouring of<br />
         financial support for SOEs during the 2008 financial crisis.<br />
<br />
         The problem for Chinese private enterprises is that, while the<br />
         country went through a series of privatization and market-oriented<br />
         reforms, changes in the political system were minimal. Rather than<br />
         promoting a free marketplace, political intervention created links<br />
         between politics and business that made the promotion of state-owned<br />
         entities the primary engine for economic reform. Political officials<br />
         became deeply involved in the countrya**s business affairs, with<br />
         many business leaders being relatives or patrons of the political<br />
         elite and many &lt;link nid=&quot;191103&quot;&gt;shuffling back and forth from one<br />
         sphere to the other&lt;/link&gt;. This created a kind of &quot;elite capitalism<br />
         economy,a** one still very much directed by the central government.<br />
         a*&quot;<br />
<br />
         Lessons from the Qing Dynasty<br />
<br />
         Beijing was alerted about this phenomenon by Chinese academics, who<br />
         repeatedly reminded the government of lessons learned by the Qing<br />
         dynasty in the early 20th Century, when it supported a state-owned<br />
         economy at the expense of the private sector. With the Western<br />
         incursion through Chinaa**s a**Open Doora** in the 1840s, Qing<br />
         rulers realized the importance of introducing foreign ideologies and<br />
         technologies that could both modernize China and help it resist<br />
         these Western forces when the time was right. In this process, a<br />
         large number of entrepreneurs strongly backed by the dynasty created<br />
         a form of a**bureaucratic capitalism.a**<br />
<br />
         At the same time, private enterprises also emerged, creating a group<br />
         of national capitalists that wanted less government control.<br />
         Chinaa**s defeat in the Sino-Japanese war in 1894-1895 made the<br />
         dynasty realize that making this sector even stronger would enhance<br />
         its modernization efforts. Still, the dynasty remained uncertain of<br />
         the proper course and continued to vacillate between these two<br />
         groups, frequently switching ownership of big projects and<br />
         enterprises.<br />
<br />
         In 1911, Qing rulers decided to nationalize Chinaa**s railway<br />
         system, in part using foreign loans. The system had been privately<br />
         owned, financed in large part by local farmers who invested their<br />
         proceeds from grain sales. The nationalization of the system sparked<br />
         local protests that began in Sichuan and eventually spread<br />
         nationwide. Although there were many other factors that undermined<br />
         the dynastya**s rule, nationalizing of the railway was the catalyst<br />
         for its downfall that same year.<br />
<br />
         Currently, Beijing is facing enormous socio-economic challenges,<br />
         with ongoing inflation and employment topping the list. Academic<br />
         studies show that Chinaa**s total private sector -- small, medium<br />
         and large enterprises -- account for nearly half of the country's<br />
         economy and 80 percent of its employment, so it is by no means an<br />
         insignificant sector. While a long-term goal of Beijing is to<br />
         restructure SMEs and reinvigorate that part of the private sector,<br />
         the situation may require more immediate attention. History shows<br />
         that the predicament of private enterprises in China is not only an<br />
         economic issue but also a political one. For a meaningful solution<br />
         to the countrya**s economic problems, Beijing may have to focus,<br />
         once again, on supporting the private side of the economy as well as<br />
         its SOEs.<br />
