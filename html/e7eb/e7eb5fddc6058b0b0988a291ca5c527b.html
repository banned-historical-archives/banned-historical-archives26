		<h3>Tor</h3>
		<p><a href="https://www.torproject.org">Tor</a> is an encrypted anonymising network that makes it harder to intercept internet communications, or see where communications are coming from or going to.</p>
		<p>In order to use the WikiLeaks public submission system as detailed above you can download the Tor Browser Bundle, which is a Firefox-like browser available for Windows, Mac OS X and GNU/Linux and pre-configured to connect using the anonymising system Tor.</p>
		<h4>Tails</h4>
		<p>If you are at high risk and you have the capacity to do so, you can also access the submission system through a secure operating system called <a href="https://tails.boum.org">Tails</a>. Tails is an operating system launched from a USB stick or a DVD that aim to leaves no traces when the computer is shut down after use and automatically routes your internet traffic through Tor. Tails will require you to have either a USB stick or a DVD at least 4GB big and a laptop or desktop computer.</p>

		<h3>Tips</h3>
		<p>Our submission system works hard to preserve your anonymity, but we recommend you also take some of your own precautions. Please review these basic guidelines. </p>
		<div>
			<h4>1. Contact us if you have specific problems</h4>
			<p>If you have a very large submission, or a submission with a complex format, or are a high-risk source, please <a href="#submit_help_contact">contact us</a>. In our experience it is always possible to find a custom solution for even the most seemingly difficult situations.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h4>2. What computer to use</h4>
			<p>If the computer you are uploading from could subsequently be audited in an investigation, consider using a computer that is not easily tied to you. Technical users can also use <a href="https://tails.boum.org">Tails</a> to help ensure you do not leave any records of your submission on the computer.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h4>3. Do not talk about your submission to others</h4>
			<p>If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in source protection – it is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This includes other media organisations.</p>
		</div>

	</div>

		<h3>After</h3>

		<div>
			<h4>1. Do not talk about your submission to others</h4>
			<p>If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in source protection – it is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This includes other media organisations.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h4>2. Act normal</h4>
			<p>If you are a high-risk source, avoid saying anything or doing anything after submitting which might promote suspicion. In particular, you should try to stick to your normal routine and behaviour.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h4>3. Remove traces of your submission</h4>
			<p>If you are a high-risk source and the computer you prepared your submission on, or uploaded it from, could subsequently be audited in an investigation, we recommend that you format and dispose of the computer hard drive and any other storage media you used.</p>
			<p>In particular, hard drives retain data after formatting which may be visible to a digital forensics team and flash media (USB sticks, memory cards and SSD drives) retain data even after a secure erasure. If you used flash media to store sensitive data, it is important to destroy the media.</p>
			<p>If you do this and are a high-risk source you should make sure there are no traces of the clean-up, since such traces themselves may draw suspicion.</p>
			<div>
				<h4>4. If you face legal action</h4>
				<p>If a legal action is brought against you as a result of your submission, there are organisations that may help you. The Courage Foundation is an international organisation dedicated to the protection of journalistic sources. You can find more details at <a href="https://www.couragefound.org">https://www.couragefound.org</a>.</p>

		<p>WikiLeaks publishes documents of political or historical importance that are censored or otherwise suppressed. We specialise in strategic global publishing and large archives.</p>
		<p>The following is the address of our secure site where you can anonymously upload your documents to WikiLeaks editors. You can only access this submissions system through Tor. (See our <a href="#submit_help_tor">Tor tab</a> for more information.) We also advise you to read our <a href="#submit_help_tips">tips for sources</a> before submitting.</p>

			<!--<div>
				Copy this address into your Tor browser. Advanced users, if they wish, can also add a further layer of encryption to their submission using <a href="#submit_wlkey">our public PGP key</a>.
			</div>-->
		</div>

		<p>If you cannot use Tor, or your submission is very large, or you have specific requirements, WikiLeaks provides several alternative methods. <a href="#submit_help_contact">Contact us</a> to discuss how to proceed.</p>

NUMBERS OF PERSONS MENTIONED. AFTER THE AGRICULTURAL UNIVERSITIES RECOVER MORE FULLY FROM THE EFFECTS OF THE CULTURAL
REVOLUTION, WE CAN EXPECT MORE GRADUATES AND UNDERGRADUATES
FOR STUDY IN THE U.S. IN DEGREE PROGRAMS.
13. THE PRC SIDE ASKED FOR LISTS OF U.S. SCHOOLS WITH PARTICULAR
STRENGTHS IN SPECIFIC AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES, AND THESE WERE
SUPPLIED TO THEM. THEY SAID THAT THEY WOULD FORWARD A DETAILED
LIST OF PERSONS AND FIELDS FOR STUDY IN THE U.S. THE U.S.
SIDE STRESSED THAT MANAGEMENT TRAINING IN AGRICULTURE SHOULD
NOT BE NEGLECTED, ENGLISH LANGUAGE COMPETENCE WOULD BE CRUCIAL
TO SUCCESS IN ANY STUDY PROGRAM, AND USE OF USDA TO COORDINATE
THE PLACEMENT OF PRC PERSONS IN U.S. SCHOOLS AND RESEARCH
INSTITUTIONS WOULD BE TO THE MUTUAL ADVANTAGE OF BOTH SIDES.
THE U.S. PROPOSAL DID NOT PRECLUDE DIRECT CONTACT BETWEEN
U.S. AND PRC INSTITUTIONS.
14. VICE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FORESTRY HO KANG SAID
THAT DUE TO LACK OF NORMAL U.S.-PRC RELATIONS, THE USDA
WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO INTERACT DIRECTLY WITH A PRC GOVERNMENT
COUNTERPART, BUT STATED THAT THE PRC CHINESE AGRICULTURAL
ASSOCIATION WOULD SERVE AS THE COUNTERPART ORGANIZATION.
USDA ASST. SEC. CUTLER SUGGESTED THAT ISEC (INTERNATIONAL
SCIENCE AND EDUCATION COUNCIL) - A JOINT COORDINATING MECHANISM
BETWEEN THE USDA AND U.S. AGRICULTURAL UNIVERSITIES, COCHAIRED BY A UNIVERSITY DEAN AND AN ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF
USDA - BE USED AS THE U.S. COUNTERPART ORGANIZATION.
15. ON NOVEMBER 8, U.S. SIDE GAVE CHINESE MOAF OFFICIALS
A DETAILED MEMORANDUM OF RECORD REVIEWING THE DISCUSSIONS
AND SETTING FORTH U.S. PROPOSALS. CHINESE APPARENTLY INTEND

AND FRIENDLY. THE CHINESE SIDE WAS VERY WELL PREPARED, AND
THEY WERE CLEARLY READY FOR SIGNIFICANT EXPANSION OF BILATERAL
AGRICULTURAL COOPERATION IN TRADE, SCIENCE AND EDUCATIONAL
EXCHANGES. WE WERE PARTICULARLY STRUCK BY THE CHINESE EXPRESSIONS OF SUPPORT FOR U.S. EFFORTS TO WORK FOR STABILIZATION
OF WORLD GRAIN PRICES, AND BY THEIR MUCH MORE FORTHCOMING

THE CHINESE WILL SEND THREE GROUPS TO THE U.S. FOR TECHNICAL
TRAINING OF THREE TO FOUR MONTHS IN APPLICATION OF REMOTE
SENSING, SOIL SURVEY AND TESTING, AND COMPUTER APPLICATIONS
IN AGRICULTURE. THE CHINESE STATED THAT DUE TO THE LACK OF
NORMALIZED RELATIONS, THEY PREFERRED THAT THE COOPERATIVE
EFFORTS BE CARRIED OUT BETWEEN THE CHINESE AGRICULTURAL ASSOCIATION ON THE PRC SIDE AND A U.S. COUNTERPART; THE U.S.
SIDE SUGGESTED THE INTERNATIONAL SCIENCE AND EDUCATION COUNCIL
(ISEC), A JOINT COORDINATING MECHANISM BETWEEN USDA AND
U.S. AGRICULTURAL UNIVERSITIES. SECRETARY BERGLAND GAVE
MOAF OFFICIALS A DETAILED MEMORANDUM OF RECORD ON NOVEMBER
8 WHICH SUMMED UP DISCUSSIONS AND INCLUDED U.S. PROPOSALS.

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
LACK OF LAND SUITABLE FOR CULTIVATION CREATED TREMENDOUS
PRESSURES TO INCREASE YIELDS. YANG ALSO DESCRIBED THE RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE MOAF. HE STATED THAT BECAUSE OF CHINA'S
PRINCIPLE OF SELF-SUFFICIENCY, IT WAS DIFFICULT TO FORECAST
IMPORT NEEDS PRECISELY FROM YEAR TO YEAR. HE EXPRESSED CONCERN
OVER THE TCK PROBLEM, AND ASKED FOR A DESCRIPTION OF U.S.
QUARANTINE PROCEDURES. SECRETARY BERGLAND AND MINISTER YANG
AGREED THAT CLOSER COOPERATION WAS NEEDED IN THE AREA OF
INSPECTION, AND THE U.S. INVITED THE PRC TO SEND A TEAM TO
OBSERVE AND MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS. BOTH SIDES AGREED TO COOPERATE
IN THE AREAS OF PLANT GERM PLASM RESOURCES, BIOLOGICAL

HIGH LEVEL OF AMERICAN TECHNOLOGY AND EQUIPMENT; (B) THEY
ARE, NEVERTHELESS, CONTACTING OTHER COUNTRIES; (C) THEY
WOULD BE FLEXIBLE ON THE MODALITIES OF TRADE COOPERATION
AND WOULD WELCOME ANY PROPOSALS FROM THE U.S. SIDE. THEY
ALSO CONVEYED A SENSE OF URGENCY IN OBTAINING MANY OF THESE
PRODUCTS. IN RESPONSE, THE U.S. SIDE INDICATED THAT WE WOULD

NUMBERS OF PERSONS MENTIONED. AFTER THE AGRICULTURAL UNIVERSITIES RECOVER MORE FULLY FROM THE EFFECTS OF THE CULTURAL
REVOLUTION, WE CAN EXPECT MORE GRADUATES AND UNDERGRADUATES
FOR STUDY IN THE U.S. IN DEGREE PROGRAMS.
13. THE PRC SIDE ASKED FOR LISTS OF U.S. SCHOOLS WITH PARTICULAR
STRENGTHS IN SPECIFIC AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES, AND THESE WERE
SUPPLIED TO THEM. THEY SAID THAT THEY WOULD FORWARD A DETAILED
LIST OF PERSONS AND FIELDS FOR STUDY IN THE U.S. THE U.S.
SIDE STRESSED THAT MANAGEMENT TRAINING IN AGRICULTURE SHOULD
NOT BE NEGLECTED, ENGLISH LANGUAGE COMPETENCE WOULD BE CRUCIAL
TO SUCCESS IN ANY STUDY PROGRAM, AND USE OF USDA TO COORDINATE
THE PLACEMENT OF PRC PERSONS IN U.S. SCHOOLS AND RESEARCH
INSTITUTIONS WOULD BE TO THE MUTUAL ADVANTAGE OF BOTH SIDES.
THE U.S. PROPOSAL DID NOT PRECLUDE DIRECT CONTACT BETWEEN
U.S. AND PRC INSTITUTIONS.
14. VICE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE AND FORESTRY HO KANG SAID
THAT DUE TO LACK OF NORMAL U.S.-PRC RELATIONS, THE USDA
WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO INTERACT DIRECTLY WITH A PRC GOVERNMENT
COUNTERPART, BUT STATED THAT THE PRC CHINESE AGRICULTURAL
ASSOCIATION WOULD SERVE AS THE COUNTERPART ORGANIZATION.
USDA ASST. SEC. CUTLER SUGGESTED THAT ISEC (INTERNATIONAL
SCIENCE AND EDUCATION COUNCIL) - A JOINT COORDINATING MECHANISM
BETWEEN THE USDA AND U.S. AGRICULTURAL UNIVERSITIES, COCHAIRED BY A UNIVERSITY DEAN AND AN ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF
USDA - BE USED AS THE U.S. COUNTERPART ORGANIZATION.
15. ON NOVEMBER 8, U.S. SIDE GAVE CHINESE MOAF OFFICIALS
A DETAILED MEMORANDUM OF RECORD REVIEWING THE DISCUSSIONS
AND SETTING FORTH U.S. PROPOSALS. CHINESE APPARENTLY INTEND
TO GIVE THEIR WRITTEN PROPOSALS TO SECRETARY BERGLAND PRIOR
TO DELEGATION'S DEPARTURE FROM PRC (WE HAVE SEEN A CHINESE
HANDWRITTEN DRAFT).
16. COMMENT: THE TALKS PROCEEDED SMOOTHLY THROUGHOUT AND

PEKING 03632 03 OF 03 091212Z

RESULTED IN AN EXTREMELY PRODUCTIVE EXCHANGE ON A WIDE RANGE
OF AGRICULTURAL ISSUES. THE ATMOSPHERICS WERE NOTABLY RELAXED
AND FRIENDLY. THE CHINESE SIDE WAS VERY WELL PREPARED, AND
THEY WERE CLEARLY READY FOR SIGNIFICANT EXPANSION OF BILATERAL
AGRICULTURAL COOPERATION IN TRADE, SCIENCE AND EDUCATIONAL
EXCHANGES. WE WERE PARTICULARLY STRUCK BY THE CHINESE EXPRESSIONS OF SUPPORT FOR U.S. EFFORTS TO WORK FOR STABILIZATION
OF WORLD GRAIN PRICES, AND BY THEIR MUCH MORE FORTHCOMING
REMARKS ON STATISTICAL DATA. ON THE S&amp;E SIDE, THESE TALKS
WERE AN OUTGROWTH OF THE GROUNDWORK LAID DURING THE PRESS
