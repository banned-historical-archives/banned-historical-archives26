		<h3>Tor</h3>
		<p><a href="https://www.torproject.org">Tor</a> is an encrypted anonymising network that makes it harder to intercept internet communications, or see where communications are coming from or going to.</p>
		<p>In order to use the WikiLeaks public submission system as detailed above you can download the Tor Browser Bundle, which is a Firefox-like browser available for Windows, Mac OS X and GNU/Linux and pre-configured to connect using the anonymising system Tor.</p>
		<h4>Tails</h4>
		<p>If you are at high risk and you have the capacity to do so, you can also access the submission system through a secure operating system called <a href="https://tails.boum.org">Tails</a>. Tails is an operating system launched from a USB stick or a DVD that aim to leaves no traces when the computer is shut down after use and automatically routes your internet traffic through Tor. Tails will require you to have either a USB stick or a DVD at least 4GB big and a laptop or desktop computer.</p>

		<h3>Tips</h3>
		<p>Our submission system works hard to preserve your anonymity, but we recommend you also take some of your own precautions. Please review these basic guidelines. </p>
		<div>
			<h4>1. Contact us if you have specific problems</h4>
			<p>If you have a very large submission, or a submission with a complex format, or are a high-risk source, please <a href="#submit_help_contact">contact us</a>. In our experience it is always possible to find a custom solution for even the most seemingly difficult situations.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h4>2. What computer to use</h4>
			<p>If the computer you are uploading from could subsequently be audited in an investigation, consider using a computer that is not easily tied to you. Technical users can also use <a href="https://tails.boum.org">Tails</a> to help ensure you do not leave any records of your submission on the computer.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h4>3. Do not talk about your submission to others</h4>
			<p>If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in source protection – it is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This includes other media organisations.</p>
		</div>

	</div>

		<h3>After</h3>

		<div>
			<h4>1. Do not talk about your submission to others</h4>
			<p>If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in source protection – it is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This includes other media organisations.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h4>2. Act normal</h4>
			<p>If you are a high-risk source, avoid saying anything or doing anything after submitting which might promote suspicion. In particular, you should try to stick to your normal routine and behaviour.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h4>3. Remove traces of your submission</h4>
			<p>If you are a high-risk source and the computer you prepared your submission on, or uploaded it from, could subsequently be audited in an investigation, we recommend that you format and dispose of the computer hard drive and any other storage media you used.</p>
			<p>In particular, hard drives retain data after formatting which may be visible to a digital forensics team and flash media (USB sticks, memory cards and SSD drives) retain data even after a secure erasure. If you used flash media to store sensitive data, it is important to destroy the media.</p>
			<p>If you do this and are a high-risk source you should make sure there are no traces of the clean-up, since such traces themselves may draw suspicion.</p>
			<div>
				<h4>4. If you face legal action</h4>
				<p>If a legal action is brought against you as a result of your submission, there are organisations that may help you. The Courage Foundation is an international organisation dedicated to the protection of journalistic sources. You can find more details at <a href="https://www.couragefound.org">https://www.couragefound.org</a>.</p>

		<p>WikiLeaks publishes documents of political or historical importance that are censored or otherwise suppressed. We specialise in strategic global publishing and large archives.</p>
		<p>The following is the address of our secure site where you can anonymously upload your documents to WikiLeaks editors. You can only access this submissions system through Tor. (See our <a href="#submit_help_tor">Tor tab</a> for more information.) We also advise you to read our <a href="#submit_help_tips">tips for sources</a> before submitting.</p>

			<!--<div>
				Copy this address into your Tor browser. Advanced users, if they wish, can also add a further layer of encryption to their submission using <a href="#submit_wlkey">our public PGP key</a>.
			</div>-->
		</div>

		<p>If you cannot use Tor, or your submission is very large, or you have specific requirements, WikiLeaks provides several alternative methods. <a href="#submit_help_contact">Contact us</a> to discuss how to proceed.</p>

OF THIS MEETING FOLLOWS.

DURING WHICH DEFENSE MINISTER XU EMPHASIZED CHINA'S BACKWARDNESS AND COMMENTED THAT GENERAL GARD'S EARLIER SERVICE
IN KOREA AND VIETNAM PROVIDED HIM WITH A GOOD UNDERSTANDING

OF ASIA.
GARD: I WOULD BE INTERESTED IN HEARING YOUR VIEWS ON CHINA'S
MILITARY MODERNIZATION, AND ESPECIALLY YOUR PRIORITIES IN
THIS RESPECT.
XU: AS FOR THE QUESTION OF THE MODERNIZATION OF CHINA'S
NATIONAL DEFENSE, THIS IS RELATED TO THE MODERNIZATION OF
CHINA'S ECONOMY. THE PRC WAS ESTABLISHED 30 YEARS AGO. DURING
THAT PERIOD WE HAVE ENCOUNTERED MANY SETBACKS. THE PRESENT
CONDITION OF OUR MILITARY EQUIPMENT IS BACKWARD, BUT IT
PROVIDES US WITH A GOOD FOUNDATION. COMPARED TO THE UNITED
STATES OUR ARMS ARE VERY BACKWARD, BUT IMPROVEMENTS ARE
CONTINUING AND SOME EQUIPMENT HAS ALREADY BEEN IMPROVED.
BUT IT WILL TAKE US TIME TO CATCH UP. THIS APPLIES TO THE
SOVIET UNION ALSO. BUT WAIT AND SEE THE PROGRESS THAT WE
MAKE. WE HAVE CONFIDENCE. THROUGH OUR EFFORTS WE HOPE THAT
IN THE FUTURE WE WILL NOT BE BACKWARD.
OF COURSE, YOU ARE AWARE OF CHINA'S POLICIES. FIRST,
WITH REGARD TO CHINA'S STRATEGY, AS CHAIRMAN MAO POINTED
OUT, OUR MAIN STRATEGIC PRINCIPLE IS PEOPLE'S WAR. IF WAR
SHOULD BREAK OUT WE WILL USE REGULAR, LOCAL, AND MILITIA
FORCES, BUT WE WILL MAINLY RELY ON THE REGULAR FORCES. IF
WE ARE NOT ATTACKED, WE WILL NOT ATTACK, BUT IF WE ARE
ATTACKED, WE WILL CERTAINLY COUNTERATTACK. WE ALSO ADHERE
TO THE PRINCIPLE OF DIGGING TUNNELS DEEP, STORING GRAIN
CONFIDENTIAL

BEIJIN 02602 01 OF 04 051123Z

EVERYWHERE, AND NEVER SEEKING HEGEMONY. NOW CHINA IS BACKWARD
AND POOR, BUT WE ARE STILL PREPARED TO FIGHT. IF WE ARE
STRONGER IN THE FUTURE AND BUILD UP OUR INDUSTRY, WE WILL
STILL FOLLOW THESE PRINCIPLES.
AS FOR THE BUILDING OF OUR ARMED FORCES, COMMANDANT
XIAO OF THE MILITARY ACADEMY HAS ALREADY DISCUSSED THIS
WITH YOU. THE MILITARY ACADEMY IS THE HIGHEST MILITARY
COLLEGE IN CHINA. BELOW IT THERE ARE ALSO MIDDLE AND LOWER
LEVEL MILITARY SCHOOLS.
AS FOR OUR MILITARY EQUIPMENT, WE WILL MAINLY IMPROVE
IT THROUGH OUR OWN EFFORTS, BUT WE WILL ALSO IMPORT ADVANCED
TECHNOLOGY TO IMPROVE OUR EQUIPMENT. BUT CHINA IS BIG, AND
WE CANNOT JUST BUY THE EQUIPMENT WE NEED. WE MUST RELY ON
OUR OWN EFFORTS. THE GENERAL TREND IS TOWARD MILITARY MODERNIZATION, AND WE ARE TRYING OUR BEST. WE MUST FIND FRIENDS
WHO WILL COOPERATE WITH US SO THAT WE CAN INTRODUCE ADVANCED
TECHNOLOGY; WE CANNOT JUST BUY EQUIPMENT. CHINA IS TOO BIG.
WE COULD NOT BUY ENOUGH. IF WE RELY ONLY ON BUYING, IT WILL
NOT SOLVE THE PROBLEM. WE MUST HAVE ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY.
WE ARE STRENGTHENING RESEARCH IN SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY,
AND IN THIS WAY WE WILL GRADUALLY IMPROVE OUR MILITARY
EQUIPMENT.

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
THE KEY POINT OF MILITARY MODERNIZATION IS TO IMPROVE
THE ARMY, AIR FORCE, AND NAVY IN THAT ORDER. WE CANNOT IMPROVE
ALL FIELDS AT THE SAME TIME. TAKE THE ATOMIC BOMB 1 54
3/-.0)3. YOU HAVE MANY, AND WE HAVE LITTLE. OUR DEVELOPMENT
OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS WAS TO BREAK THE NUCLEAR MONOPOLY AND
PREVENT NUCLEAR BLACKMAIL. BUT SOME ARE ENOUGH, AND WE DO
NOT PROPOSE TO MAKE MANY NUCLEAR WEAPONS.
THE CHINESE NAVY DOES NOT INTRUDE INTO THE WATERS OF
OTHER COUNTRIES. THE DEVELOPMENT OF WARSHIPS FOR OUR ADJACENT
SEAS WILL BE THE GENERAL GOAL OF OUR NAVAL MODERNIZATION.
THAT IS ALL OUR STRENGTH CAN MANAGE. WE ARE ALSO STRENGTHENING
OUR ANTI-TANK AND ANTI-AIR EQUIPMENT, BECAUSE WE CAN SPEND
A LITTLE IN THESE AREAS AND ACHIEVE OUR PURPOSES MORE QUICKLY.
IF WE ATTEMPTED TO MODERNIZE THE ENTIRE AIR FORCE, IT WOULD

BEIJIN 02602 01 OF 04 051123Z

TAKE A LONG TIME AND REQUIRE MORE MONEY. THE SAME APPLIES
TO TANKS. WE WOULD HAVE TO SPEND MORE MONEY TO BUILD TANKS,
FOR TANKS AND THE AIR FORCE REQUIRE MONEY AND TECHNICALLY
MODERN EQUIPMENT. WE HOPE TO RELY ON OUR OWN RESEARCH TO
IMPROVE OUR TECHNOLOGY GRADUALLY. TO FIGHT A MODERN WAR
WITHOUT AIR FORCE SUPPORT IS DIFFICULT FOR THE GROUND FORCES,
SO WE MUST DEVELOP OUR ANTI-AIR ABILITIES. TO IMPROVE OUR
ANTI-AIR AND ANTI-TANK EQUIPMENT DOES NOT REQUIRE SO MUCH
MONEY AND RESULTS ARE FASTER.

SOME OF YOU ARE PROFICIENT IN ECONOMICS SO I WILL COMMENT
ON CHINA'S ECONOMY. WHEN THE GANG OF FOUR WAS SMASHED,
POLITICAL STABILITY WAS ACHIEVED AND THE ECONOMY BEGAN TO
RECOVER. WE HAVE FIVE YEAR OR LONGER PLANS, BUT WE ARE
DISCUSSING THE STEPS WE SHOULD TAKE. IN THE PAST SOME STEPS
HAVE BEEN TOO BIG, AND WE NEED SOME READJUSTMENT. THIS MEANS
WE MUST MAKE UP AREAS WHERE WE HAVE SHORTCOMINGS AND LET
WAIT AREAS WHERE WE ARE GOING TOO FAST. OUR GOAL IS BALANCED
DEVELOPMENT. WE CANNOT RELY ON IMPORTED GRAIN. WE GET SOME
GRAIN FROM THE US, BUT WE CANNOT RELY ON THIS. WE MUST SOLVE
OUR FOOD PROBLEM IN THE LONG TERM. WE MUST RAISE OUR GRAIN
AND FOOD OUTPUT.
WE ALSO HAVE INDUSTRIAL PROBLEMS, SOME OF WHICH ARE
BIG. WE PREVIOUSLY TRIED TO DEVELOP THE ECONOMY, BUT WE
DID NOT HAVE ENOUGH POWER TO SUPPORT THE DEVELOPMENT OF

INDUSTRY. WE MUST DEVELOP ELECTRIC POWER, COAL, PETROLEUM,

COMPARISON WITH DEVELOPED COUNTRIES. WE NEED FOREIGN EXCHANGE
FOR NEW EQUIPMENT AND TECHNOLOGY AND MUST PAY ATTENTION
TO AREAS THAT CAN EARN FOREIGN EXCHANGE.
WE ARE UNITED UNDER THE PARTY CENTRAL COMMITTEE HEADED

OLDER GENERATION. BUT CHAIRMAN HUA IS ONLY 59 AND IS MIDDLEAGED. WE ALSO HAVE LEADERS WHO ARE IN THEIR TWENTIES, THIRTIES,
OR FORTIES. INSIDE CHINA WE CAN UNITE ALL LEADERS AROUND
THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE HEADED BY CHAIRMAN HUA TO OVERCOME
DIFFICULTIES AND REALIZE THE FOUR MODERNIZATIONS. OUR MODERNIZATION WILL NOT BE US OR JAPANESE STYLE; IT WILL BE
CHINESE STYLE. CHINA'S POPULATION AND AREA ARE BIG. OUR
POPULATION IS ALMOST 900 MILLION. OUR PRODUCTION IS BACKWARD.
OUR MODERNIZATION WILL BE CHINESE STYLE. WE HAVE NEARLY
20 YEARS UNTIL THE END OF THE CENTURY, SO THE POSSIBILITIES
OF REACHING OUR GOAL ARE STRONG. PEOPLE LIKE ME MAY NOT
SEE IT, BUT WE HAVE OTHERS IN THE NEXT GENERATION WHO WILL
REALIZE THE FOUR MODERNIZATIONS. THIS IS OUR PRESENT ECONOMIC
CONDITION. YOU ARE NOW VISITING CHINA, AND WE HAVE THE SAYING:
SEEING IS BELIEVING.
AS REGARDS THE WORLD SITUATION, THE MAIN FOCUS OF SOVIET
STRATEGY IS IN EUROPE, BUT THE SOVIET UNION IS NOT RELAXING

AN ASIAN COLLECTIVE SECURITY SYSTEM. IN THE PAST OTHER
COUNTRIES DID NOT RESPOND TO THIS SLOGAN; ONLY SOVIET ALLIES
DID. EVEN INDIRA GANGHI DID NOT RESPOND FAVORABLY. NOW THINGS
ARE CHANGED. THERE IS THE PROBLEM OF VIETNAM, THE CUBA OF
THE EAST. VIETNAM AND THE SOVIET UNION ARE WORKING HAND IN

KAMPUCHEA. WHY ARE THEY SO DARING? BECAUSE OF SOVIET SUPPORT.
THE SOVIET FRIENDSHIP TREATY WITH VIETNAM IS ACTUALLY A
MILITARY ALLIANCE. ONCE THE TREATY WAS CONCLUDED, VIETNAM
BEGAN ITS WAR IN KAMPUCHEA.
ALTHOUGH THERE ARE SERIOUS DEVELOPMENTS IN THE FAR
EAST, THE KEY POINT OF SOVIET STRATEGY IS IN EUROPE. WE
HAVE READ THE VIEWS EXPRESSED IN US NEWSPAPERS, AND WE SEE
OUR VIEWS ARE THE SAME. IN OUR VIEW ONLY THE US AND THE
SOVIETS ARE QUALIFIED TO START A LARGE WAR AND TO TRY TO
CONTROL THE WORLD. CHINA IS NOT QUALIFIED FOR THIS, AND
THE PRINCIPLES OF MARXISM-LENINISM-MAO ZEDONG THOUGHT PROHIBIT
US FROM TRYING. IN THE FUTURE WHEN WE ARE STRONGER, WE WILL
ALSO NOT ENGAGE IN AGGRESSIVE WARS.
THE MAIN DANGER IS FROM THE SOVIET UNION. IN AFRICA, THE
MIDDLE EAST, AND SOUTHEAST ASIA YOU WILL DISCOVER THAT THE
SOVIET UNION IS EXTENDING ITS ARMS AND LAUNCHING AGGRESSIVE
WARS. THE SOVIETS ARE CREATING TROUBLES, SO THE MAIN DANGER
COMES FROM THE SOVIET UNION. IT IS EXTENDING ITS ARMS TO
TOO MANY AREAS. CHINA HAS WARNED VARIOUS COUNTRIES TO BE
VIGILANT. THIS IS ONE OF OUR COMMON POINTS WITH THE US.
WE HAVE MANY COMMON POINTS WITH THE US, BUT THE MAIN ONE
IS DEALING WITH THE SOVIET UNION.
WE SENT TROOPS AGAINST VIETNAM, BUT THIS WAS NOT JUST
A PUNITIVE ACTION AGAINST VIETNAM BUT AGAINST THE SOVIET
UNION ALSO. VIETNAM IS THE CUBA OF THE EAST, AND THE SINOVIETNAMESE BORDER PROBLEM IS NOT A PROBLEM AFFECTING TWO
COUNTRIES ONLY. WHEN OUR PROBLEMS ON THE BORDER WITH VIETNAM
BEGAN, WE ORDERED OUR BORDER FORCES NOT TO OPEN FIRE AND TO
TRY TO REASON THINGS OUT. BUT VIETNAM DISPLAYED NO RESTRAINT
AND THINGS WENT FROM BAD TO WORSE. THEY KILLED MANY CIVILIANS
AND BORDER TROOPS. WE WARNED VIETNAM NOT TO INVADE KAMPUCHUA, WHICH WAS FRIENDLY TO US. BUT DEVELOPMENTS WENT DIFFERENTLY, AND WE WERE FORCED TO COUNTERATTACK. THIS WAS A
LIMITED ACTION IN BOTH AREA AND TIME. WE STAYED IN THE BORDER
AREA. WE SAID WE WOULD TEACH THEM A LESSON AND WITHDRAW.
WE SHOWED THAT WHAT CHINA SAYS COUNTS AND THAT VIETNAM WILL

THE SOVIETS ARE SEEKING EVERY CHANCE TO MAKE TROUBLE,
SUCH AS IN AFRICA. CUBA IS NEAR THE UNITED STATES BUT YOU
DID LITTLE TO CONSTRAIN IT. NOW CUBANS ARE IN AFRICA WITH
SOVIET SUPPORT. NOW THE MIDDLE EAST PROBLEM IS NOT SOLVED.
WE DID NOT CRITICIZE THE EGYPT-ISRAELI PEACE TREATY. WE
HAVE SYMPATHY FOR SADAT, WHO HAS MANY DIFFICULTIES. BUT
THE FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEM IS NOT SOLVED. TEN ARAB STATES HAVE
BROKEN RELATIONS WITH EGYPT, WHICH IS VERY ISOLATED. SOME
ARABS ARE PRO-SOVIET. AS FOR THE FUTURE, WE MUST WAIT AND
SEE. THE PROBLEMS POSED BY IRAN AND AFGHANISTAN ARE NOT
RESTRICTED TO THOSE COUNTRIES ONLY. THEY AFFECT THE US AND
JAPAN. IRAN AND AFGHANISTAN ARE NOT BIG PROBLEMS FOR CHINA
SINCE WE HAVE NO OIL IMPORTS. MOSTLY THE US, JAPAN, AND

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
AND THIS REQUIRES GREAT EFFORTS. IT IS A WORLD-WIDE PROBLEM.
IF VIETNAM GETS THE UPPER HAND IN INVADING KAMPUCHEA, STABILITY
IN SOUTHEAST ASIA WILL BE DISTURBED. KAMPUCHEA IS A GREAT
BURDEN FOR VIETNAM THAT WILL CREATE TROUBLES FOR IT. SOME
HAVE ADVOCATED GIVING AID TO VIETNAM OR ESTABLISHING DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS WITH IT IN ORDER TO RESTRAIN IT. THIS WILL
NOT WORK. DURING THE VIETNAM-US WAR, CHINA GAVE 20 BILLION
DOLLARS IN AID TO VIETNAM, BUT THIS FAILED TO RESTRAIN IT.
AID TO VIETNAM WILL NOT BE ENOUGH. IN COUNTERATTACKING
VIETNAM, WE WERE DEALING NOT JUST WITH A SINO-VIETNAMESE
PROBLEM BUT WITH A WORLD-WIDE ONE. THE SOVIET UNION IS BACKING

BE SO AGGRESSIVE. SO YOU MUST STUDY ASIAN PROBLEMS MORE
SINCE THEY ARE LINKED TO EUROPE AND THE US. THE INDO-CHINESE
PROBLEM IS BOTH ASIAN AND WORLD-WIDE. WE SHOULD EXAMINE
THIS PROBLEM FROM A LONG TERM POINT OF VIEW.
ANOTHER PROBLEM IS DISARMAMENT. WE ARE NOT AGAINST
THIS, BUT WE DO NOT THINK NEGOTIATIONS WILL BE EFFECTIVE.
THEY HAVE CONTINUED FOR MANY DECADES, BUT THE MORE TALK
THERE IS ABOUT DISARMAMENT, THE MORE ARMS THERE ARE IN THE
WORLD. IN NUCLEAR WEAPONS, THE SOVIETS ARE NOW ALMOST EQUAL
TO THE US. MAYBE US WEAPONS ARE QUALITATIVELY BETTER, BUT
THE QUANTITIES ARE EQUAL. IN EUROPE, THE BALANCE OF MILITARY
FORCES IS THE SAME, AND WARSAW PACT STRENGTH HAS ALMOST
SURPASSED THAT OF THE WESTERN COUNTRIES. NOW, SOVIET SS-20S
ARE BEING DEPLOYED IN EUROPE. SOVIET GROUND-BASED NUCLEAR
WEAPONS ARE ALSO SUPERIOR TO THOSE IN EUROPE. DESPITE THE
TALK, THERE ARE MORE AND MORE NUCLEAR WEAPONS. THE SAME
APPLIES TO THE ARMY AND THE AIR FORCE. THE SOVIET NAVY IS
NOW NUMBER ONE IN THE WORLD. THE SOVIETS HAVE FOUR FLEETS,
AND THE NORTHERN FLEET IS VERY LARGE. YOU KNOW THIS BETTER
THAN I. THE SOVIET NAVY NOW REACHES WHEREVDY THERE IS SEA.
THE NUMBERS OF VIETNAMESE TROOPS HAVE ALMOST DOUBLED. THERE
WERE 400-500,000 AND NOW THERE ARE OVER ONE MILLION. SO
DESPITE DISARMAMENT TALKS, THERE ARE NO REDUCTIONS.
EVERY COUNTRY NEEDS MILITARY STRENGTH TO PROTECT ITS
OWN INTERESTS. WE EVEN SUPPORT MILITARY FORCES FOR JAPAN TO
PROTECT ITSELF. EACH COUNTRY HAS THE RIGHT TO PROTECT ITS
INDEPENDENCE AND SOVEREIGNTY. THIS IS ALLOWED. BUT IF YOU
SURPASS THESE LIMITS, THEN IT BECOMES A PROBLEM. THE SOVIETS
TALK, BUT THEY DO NOT REDUCE THEIR FORCES. THEY HAVE GREATLY
STRENGTHENED THEIR AIR, NAVY AND GROUND FORCES. THESE ARE
MY PERSONAL OPINIONS SINCE WE ARE JUST HAVING AN EXCHANGE OF
VIEWS. THERE ARE THOSE WHO HOPE THAT DETENTE WILL RELAX THE
WORLD SITUATION, BUT IT WILL ONLY BE USED BY THE SOVIETS

FOR THEIR OWN PURPOSES. WE MUST KEEP A COOL HEAD. YOU NOW
HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO SEE CHINA, AND YOU CAN EXCHANGE VIEWS
WITH US. I HOPE YOU WILL SEE MILITARY UNITS IN CHINA. PLEASE
GIVE US YOUR VALUABLE OPINIONS.
GARD: COULD WE ASK SOME QUESTIONS?
XU: AS YOU WISH.
Q: DURING VICE PREMIER TENG'S VISIT TO THE US, HE SPOKE TO
CONGRESS JUST BEFORE THE COUNTERATTACK AGAINST VIETNAM AND
SPOKE OF TEACHING VIETNAM A LESSON AND OF THE HOPE THAT
VIETNAM WOULD WITHDRAW FROM KAMPUCHEA. BUT THEY HAVE CONTINUED THEIR ATTACK. DID YOU REALIZE YOUR OBJECTIVE AND,
IF SO, WHAT DID YOU GAIN?
XU: THE PUNITIVE ACTION IN VIETNAM WAS TO TEACH THEM A LESSON
- TO LET THEM KNOW THAT THEY COULD NOT EXPAND THEIR OWN
INFLUENCE IN ALL AREAS AT WILL. NEGOTIATIONS ARE NOW GOING
ON, AND IN THE NEGOTIATIONS WE HAVE RAISED EIGHT POINTS
IN ORDER TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM. ONE OF THESE EIGHT POINTS
IS THAT VIETNAM SHOULD WITHDRAW ITS FORCES FROM KAMPUCHEA,
AND THAT IS ONE OF OUR NEGOTIATING AIMS. EVEN DURING THE
GROUND ATTACK WE DID NOT INTEND TO SEND OUR TROOPS TO HANOI.
OUR GOALS WERE LIMITED. WE JUST WANTED TO GIVE THEM A LESSON
THAT IT WOULD NOT DO TO INTRUDE INTO OTHER COUNTRIES AT
WILL. WE DID NOT HOPE THAT THE COUNTERATTACK WOULD FORCE
VIETNAM TO WITHDRAW FROM KAMPUCHEA. WE WOULD LIKE FOR THIS
TO HAPPEN OF COURSE, BUT THIS DEPENDS ON VIETNAM. NOW NEGOTIATIONS ARE GOING ON. KAMPUCHEA IS AN INDEPENDENT COUNTRY,
AND WE WOULD HOPE ITS BORDER PROBLEMS WITH VIETNAM COULD
BE SOLVED BY PEACEFUL NEGOTIATIONS. BUT VIETNAM HAS 15
DIVISIONS IN KAMPUCHEA, AND THE SOVIETS ARE HELPING THEM
TO TRANSPORT TROOPS. AS FOR THE FUTURE, WE MUST WAIT AND
SEE. IN VIETNAM THERE ARE GREAT ECONOMIC PROBLEMS. THEY
DO NOT HAVE ENOUGH FOOD. IF THEY DO NOT WITHDRAW, THEY MUST

SHOULDER THE BURDEN OF KAMPUCHEA. WE WILL SEE HOW LONG THEY
CAN BEAR IT. IN UNDERTAKING OUR PUNITIVE ACTION WE WOULD
HAVE LIKED FOR VIETNAM TO WITHDRAW FROM KAMPUCHEA BUT IT
DID NOT. AS REGARDS THE SINO-VIETNAMESE BORDER INCIDENT,
EVEN THE US GAVE ITS VIEWS AND SAID THAT VIETNAM AND CHINA
BOTH SHOULD WITHDRAW. VICE PREMIER TENG SAID THAT THIS WAS
A FAIR DEMAND. WE DID NOT WANT TO OCCUPY VIETNAM. THIS IS
NOT JUST A CHINESE PROBLEM, BUT AN INDO-CHINESE PROBLEM
AS WELL. VIETNAM WANTS TO SET UP AN INDO-CHINESE FEDERATION,

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
AND THE SOVIETS WANT AN ASIAN COLLECTIVE SECURITY SYSTEM.
IF THESE ARE COMBINED IT WILL BECOME A WORLD PROBLEM WHICH
INVOLVES THE COUNTRIES OF THE PACIFIC AND THE INDIAN OCEAN
AS WELL. WE HOPE THAT ALL COUNTRIES INCLUDING THE US WILL
WORK JOINTLY TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM.
I SHOULD ADD THAT EVEN AT THE BEGINNING OF THE COUNTERATTACK, CHINA DID NOT EXPECT VIETNAM TO WITHDRAW FROM KAMPUCHEA. IF VIETNAM HAD WITHDRAWN, THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN
BETTER BUT THINGS ARE NOT THAT SIMPLE. ANOTHER PURPOSE WAS
TO PUT ENOUGH MILITARY PRESSURE ON VIETNAM SO THAT IT WOULD
REDUCE ITS PRESSURE ON KAMPUCHEA AND GIVE KAMPUCHEA TIME

MILITARY STRENGTH CHINA WOULD LIKE TO SEE JAPAN DEVELOP)
XU: AS FOR THE MILITARY STRENGTH THAT JAPAN SHOULD HAVE TO
DEAL WITH THE SOVIET THREAT, THAT IS JAPAN'S INTERNAL AFFAIR.
OUR OPINION THAT JAPAN SHOULD HAVE ENOUGH STRENGTH FOR
DEFENSE IS NOT A NEW IDEA. THIS WAS ALSO CHINA'S VIEW WHEN
CHAIRMAN MAO AND PREMIER ZHOU WERE ALIVE. AFTER WORLD WAR
II, THERE WAS SOMETHING CALLED THE SAN FRANCISCO TREATY
WHICH BOTH CHINA AND THE US SIGNED. EVEN THE CONSTITUTION
OF JAPAN SAYS THAT JAPAN CANNOT HAVE ARMED FORCES. SO JAPAN
IS DEPRIVED OF THE RIGHT TO HAVE STRONG MILITARY FORCES.
WE SAID YEARS AGO THAT JAPAN SHOULD HAVE SUFFICIENT MILITARY
STRENGTH TO DEFEND ITS TERRITORY. AS TO HOW MUCH, THAT IS
ITS INTERNAL AFFAIR. THIS IS ONLY A SUGGESTION. THIS IS
NOT A NEW VIEW.
(AFTER THE INTERPRETER WAS CORRECTED)
AS FOR MILITARY RELATIONS BETWEEN JAPAN AND CHINA, JAPAN
SHOULD HAVE ENOUGH MILITARY STRENGTH TO DEFEND ITS TERRITORY
AND SOVEREIGNTTY. AS TO HOW WE SHOULD DEAL WITH THE SOVIET
THREAT, WE CAN DISCUSS AND NEGOTIATE ON THE PROBLEM. DEALING
WITH THE SOVIET UNION IS NOT A PROBLEM FOR ONE COUNTRY ONLY.
IT IS A WORLD-WIDE PROBLEM. ONLY THROUGH JOINT EFFORTS CAN
WE POSTPONE A WORLD WAR.
LET ME ADD A FEW WORDS. CHINA HAS ALREADY SIGNED A PEACE
AND FRIENDSHIP TREATY WITH JAPAN. WE ALSO HAD A FRIENDSHIP
AND COOPERATION TREATY WITH THE SOVIET UNION WHICH WAS
DIRECTED AGAINST JAPAN. THIS HAS ALREADY BEEN ABOLISHED.
JAPAN IS CAPITALIST AND WE ARE SOCIALIST, SO WE WILL NOT
JOIN IN A TREATY FOR DEFENSIVE PURPOSES. BUT DEALING WITH
THE SOVIET UNION IS NOT ONE COUNTRY'S PROBLEM. THE US IS
THE STRONGEST POWER, BUT IT IS NOT STRONG ENOUGH ALONE.

THE FIGHT. IN THE END WE WOULD SUCCEED BECAUSE CHINA IS

WE CANNOT JOIN JAPAN IN A MILITARY ALLIANCE OR ANYTHING
LIKE THAT. BUT THE SOVIET PROBLEM IS NOT FOR ONE COUNTRY
ALONE. ROY

OF ASIA.
GARD: I WOULD BE INTERESTED IN HEARING YOUR VIEWS ON CHINA'S
MILITARY MODERNIZATION, AND ESPECIALLY YOUR PRIORITIES IN
THIS RESPECT.
XU: AS FOR THE QUESTION OF THE MODERNIZATION OF CHINA'S
NATIONAL DEFENSE, THIS IS RELATED TO THE MODERNIZATION OF
CHINA'S ECONOMY. THE PRC WAS ESTABLISHED 30 YEARS AGO. DURING
THAT PERIOD WE HAVE ENCOUNTERED MANY SETBACKS. THE PRESENT
CONDITION OF OUR MILITARY EQUIPMENT IS BACKWARD, BUT IT
PROVIDES US WITH A GOOD FOUNDATION. COMPARED TO THE UNITED
STATES OUR ARMS ARE VERY BACKWARD, BUT IMPROVEMENTS ARE
CONTINUING AND SOME EQUIPMENT HAS ALREADY BEEN IMPROVED.
BUT IT WILL TAKE US TIME TO CATCH UP. THIS APPLIES TO THE
SOVIET UNION ALSO. BUT WAIT AND SEE THE PROGRESS THAT WE
MAKE. WE HAVE CONFIDENCE. THROUGH OUR EFFORTS WE HOPE THAT
IN THE FUTURE WE WILL NOT BE BACKWARD.
OF COURSE, YOU ARE AWARE OF CHINA'S POLICIES. FIRST,
WITH REGARD TO CHINA'S STRATEGY, AS CHAIRMAN MAO POINTED
OUT, OUR MAIN STRATEGIC PRINCIPLE IS PEOPLE'S WAR. IF WAR
SHOULD BREAK OUT WE WILL USE REGULAR, LOCAL, AND MILITIA
FORCES, BUT WE WILL MAINLY RELY ON THE REGULAR FORCES. IF
WE ARE NOT ATTACKED, WE WILL NOT ATTACK, BUT IF WE ARE
ATTACKED, WE WILL CERTAINLY COUNTERATTACK. WE ALSO ADHERE
TO THE PRINCIPLE OF DIGGING TUNNELS DEEP, STORING GRAIN
CONFIDENTIAL

PAGE 03

BEIJIN 02602 01 OF 04 051123Z

EVERYWHERE, AND NEVER SEEKING HEGEMONY. NOW CHINA IS BACKWARD
AND POOR, BUT WE ARE STILL PREPARED TO FIGHT. IF WE ARE
STRONGER IN THE FUTURE AND BUILD UP OUR INDUSTRY, WE WILL
STILL FOLLOW THESE PRINCIPLES.
AS FOR THE BUILDING OF OUR ARMED FORCES, COMMANDANT
XIAO OF THE MILITARY ACADEMY HAS ALREADY DISCUSSED THIS
WITH YOU. THE MILITARY ACADEMY IS THE HIGHEST MILITARY
COLLEGE IN CHINA. BELOW IT THERE ARE ALSO MIDDLE AND LOWER
LEVEL MILITARY SCHOOLS.
AS FOR OUR MILITARY EQUIPMENT, WE WILL MAINLY IMPROVE
IT THROUGH OUR OWN EFFORTS, BUT WE WILL ALSO IMPORT ADVANCED
TECHNOLOGY TO IMPROVE OUR EQUIPMENT. BUT CHINA IS BIG, AND
WE CANNOT JUST BUY THE EQUIPMENT WE NEED. WE MUST RELY ON
OUR OWN EFFORTS. THE GENERAL TREND IS TOWARD MILITARY MODERNIZATION, AND WE ARE TRYING OUR BEST. WE MUST FIND FRIENDS
WHO WILL COOPERATE WITH US SO THAT WE CAN INTRODUCE ADVANCED
TECHNOLOGY; WE CANNOT JUST BUY EQUIPMENT. CHINA IS TOO BIG.
WE COULD NOT BUY ENOUGH. IF WE RELY ONLY ON BUYING, IT WILL
NOT SOLVE THE PROBLEM. WE MUST HAVE ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY.
WE ARE STRENGTHENING RESEARCH IN SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY,
AND IN THIS WAY WE WILL GRADUALLY IMPROVE OUR MILITARY
EQUIPMENT.

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
THE KEY POINT OF MILITARY MODERNIZATION IS TO IMPROVE
THE ARMY, AIR FORCE, AND NAVY IN THAT ORDER. WE CANNOT IMPROVE
ALL FIELDS AT THE SAME TIME. TAKE THE ATOMIC BOMB 1 54
3/-.0)3. YOU HAVE MANY, AND WE HAVE LITTLE. OUR DEVELOPMENT
OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS WAS TO BREAK THE NUCLEAR MONOPOLY AND
PREVENT NUCLEAR BLACKMAIL. BUT SOME ARE ENOUGH, AND WE DO
NOT PROPOSE TO MAKE MANY NUCLEAR WEAPONS.
THE CHINESE NAVY DOES NOT INTRUDE INTO THE WATERS OF
OTHER COUNTRIES. THE DEVELOPMENT OF WARSHIPS FOR OUR ADJACENT
SEAS WILL BE THE GENERAL GOAL OF OUR NAVAL MODERNIZATION.
THAT IS ALL OUR STRENGTH CAN MANAGE. WE ARE ALSO STRENGTHENING
OUR ANTI-TANK AND ANTI-AIR EQUIPMENT, BECAUSE WE CAN SPEND
A LITTLE IN THESE AREAS AND ACHIEVE OUR PURPOSES MORE QUICKLY.
IF WE ATTEMPTED TO MODERNIZE THE ENTIRE AIR FORCE, IT WOULD

TAKE A LONG TIME AND REQUIRE MORE MONEY. THE SAME APPLIES
TO TANKS. WE WOULD HAVE TO SPEND MORE MONEY TO BUILD TANKS,
FOR TANKS AND THE AIR FORCE REQUIRE MONEY AND TECHNICALLY
MODERN EQUIPMENT. WE HOPE TO RELY ON OUR OWN RESEARCH TO
IMPROVE OUR TECHNOLOGY GRADUALLY. TO FIGHT A MODERN WAR
WITHOUT AIR FORCE SUPPORT IS DIFFICULT FOR THE GROUND FORCES,
SO WE MUST DEVELOP OUR ANTI-AIR ABILITIES. TO IMPROVE OUR
ANTI-AIR AND ANTI-TANK EQUIPMENT DOES NOT REQUIRE SO MUCH
MONEY AND RESULTS ARE FASTER.

GRAIN FROM THE US, BUT WE CANNOT RELY ON THIS. WE MUST SOLVE

DIFFICULTIES AND REALIZE THE FOUR MODERNIZATIONS. OUR MODERNIZATION WILL NOT BE US OR JAPANESE STYLE; IT WILL BE
CHINESE STYLE. CHINA'S POPULATION AND AREA ARE BIG. OUR
POPULATION IS ALMOST 900 MILLION. OUR PRODUCTION IS BACKWARD.
OUR MODERNIZATION WILL BE CHINESE STYLE. WE HAVE NEARLY
20 YEARS UNTIL THE END OF THE CENTURY, SO THE POSSIBILITIES
OF REACHING OUR GOAL ARE STRONG. PEOPLE LIKE ME MAY NOT

BEGAN ITS WAR IN KAMPUCHEA.
ALTHOUGH THERE ARE SERIOUS DEVELOPMENTS IN THE FAR
EAST, THE KEY POINT OF SOVIET STRATEGY IS IN EUROPE. WE
HAVE READ THE VIEWS EXPRESSED IN US NEWSPAPERS, AND WE SEE
OUR VIEWS ARE THE SAME. IN OUR VIEW ONLY THE US AND THE
SOVIETS ARE QUALIFIED TO START A LARGE WAR AND TO TRY TO
CONTROL THE WORLD. CHINA IS NOT QUALIFIED FOR THIS, AND
THE PRINCIPLES OF MARXISM-LENINISM-MAO ZEDONG THOUGHT PROHIBIT
US FROM TRYING. IN THE FUTURE WHEN WE ARE STRONGER, WE WILL
ALSO NOT ENGAGE IN AGGRESSIVE WARS.
THE MAIN DANGER IS FROM THE SOVIET UNION. IN AFRICA, THE
MIDDLE EAST, AND SOUTHEAST ASIA YOU WILL DISCOVER THAT THE
SOVIET UNION IS EXTENDING ITS ARMS AND LAUNCHING AGGRESSIVE
WARS. THE SOVIETS ARE CREATING TROUBLES, SO THE MAIN DANGER
COMES FROM THE SOVIET UNION. IT IS EXTENDING ITS ARMS TO
TOO MANY AREAS. CHINA HAS WARNED VARIOUS COUNTRIES TO BE
VIGILANT. THIS IS ONE OF OUR COMMON POINTS WITH THE US.
WE HAVE MANY COMMON POINTS WITH THE US, BUT THE MAIN ONE
IS DEALING WITH THE SOVIET UNION.
WE SENT TROOPS AGAINST VIETNAM, BUT THIS WAS NOT JUST
A PUNITIVE ACTION AGAINST VIETNAM BUT AGAINST THE SOVIET
UNION ALSO. VIETNAM IS THE CUBA OF THE EAST, AND THE SINOVIETNAMESE BORDER PROBLEM IS NOT A PROBLEM AFFECTING TWO
COUNTRIES ONLY. WHEN OUR PROBLEMS ON THE BORDER WITH VIETNAM
BEGAN, WE ORDERED OUR BORDER FORCES NOT TO OPEN FIRE AND TO
TRY TO REASON THINGS OUT. BUT VIETNAM DISPLAYED NO RESTRAINT
AND THINGS WENT FROM BAD TO WORSE. THEY KILLED MANY CIVILIANS
AND BORDER TROOPS. WE WARNED VIETNAM NOT TO INVADE KAMPUCHUA, WHICH WAS FRIENDLY TO US. BUT DEVELOPMENTS WENT DIFFERENTLY, AND WE WERE FORCED TO COUNTERATTACK. THIS WAS A
LIMITED ACTION IN BOTH AREA AND TIME. WE STAYED IN THE BORDER
AREA. WE SAID WE WOULD TEACH THEM A LESSON AND WITHDRAW.
WE SHOWED THAT WHAT CHINA SAYS COUNTS AND THAT VIETNAM WILL

NOT BE ALLOWED TO GET AWAY WITH AGGRESSION.
THE SOVIETS ARE SEEKING EVERY CHANCE TO MAKE TROUBLE,
SUCH AS IN AFRICA. CUBA IS NEAR THE UNITED STATES BUT YOU
DID LITTLE TO CONSTRAIN IT. NOW CUBANS ARE IN AFRICA WITH
SOVIET SUPPORT. NOW THE MIDDLE EAST PROBLEM IS NOT SOLVED.
WE DID NOT CRITICIZE THE EGYPT-ISRAELI PEACE TREATY. WE
HAVE SYMPATHY FOR SADAT, WHO HAS MANY DIFFICULTIES. BUT
THE FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEM IS NOT SOLVED. TEN ARAB STATES HAVE
BROKEN RELATIONS WITH EGYPT, WHICH IS VERY ISOLATED. SOME
ARABS ARE PRO-SOVIET. AS FOR THE FUTURE, WE MUST WAIT AND
SEE. THE PROBLEMS POSED BY IRAN AND AFGHANISTAN ARE NOT
RESTRICTED TO THOSE COUNTRIES ONLY. THEY AFFECT THE US AND
JAPAN. IRAN AND AFGHANISTAN ARE NOT BIG PROBLEMS FOR CHINA
SINCE WE HAVE NO OIL IMPORTS. MOSTLY THE US, JAPAN, AND

INVITE YOU TO STUDY THESE PROBLEMS FURTHER.
SOVIET AGGRESSION AND EXPANSIONISM MUST BE RESTRAINED,

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
AND THIS REQUIRES GREAT EFFORTS. IT IS A WORLD-WIDE PROBLEM.
IF VIETNAM GETS THE UPPER HAND IN INVADING KAMPUCHEA, STABILITY
IN SOUTHEAST ASIA WILL BE DISTURBED. KAMPUCHEA IS A GREAT
BURDEN FOR VIETNAM THAT WILL CREATE TROUBLES FOR IT. SOME
HAVE ADVOCATED GIVING AID TO VIETNAM OR ESTABLISHING DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS WITH IT IN ORDER TO RESTRAIN IT. THIS WILL
NOT WORK. DURING THE VIETNAM-US WAR, CHINA GAVE 20 BILLION
DOLLARS IN AID TO VIETNAM, BUT THIS FAILED TO RESTRAIN IT.
AID TO VIETNAM WILL NOT BE ENOUGH. IN COUNTERATTACKING
VIETNAM, WE WERE DEALING NOT JUST WITH A SINO-VIETNAMESE
PROBLEM BUT WITH A WORLD-WIDE ONE. THE SOVIET UNION IS BACKING
VIETNAM. WITHOUT SOVIET BACKING, VIETNAM WOULD NOT DARE TO

BE SO AGGRESSIVE. SO YOU MUST STUDY ASIAN PROBLEMS MORE
SINCE THEY ARE LINKED TO EUROPE AND THE US. THE INDO-CHINESE
PROBLEM IS BOTH ASIAN AND WORLD-WIDE. WE SHOULD EXAMINE
THIS PROBLEM FROM A LONG TERM POINT OF VIEW.
ANOTHER PROBLEM IS DISARMAMENT. WE ARE NOT AGAINST
THIS, BUT WE DO NOT THINK NEGOTIATIONS WILL BE EFFECTIVE.
THEY HAVE CONTINUED FOR MANY DECADES, BUT THE MORE TALK
THERE IS ABOUT DISARMAMENT, THE MORE ARMS THERE ARE IN THE
WORLD. IN NUCLEAR WEAPONS, THE SOVIETS ARE NOW ALMOST EQUAL
TO THE US. MAYBE US WEAPONS ARE QUALITATIVELY BETTER, BUT
THE QUANTITIES ARE EQUAL. IN EUROPE, THE BALANCE OF MILITARY
FORCES IS THE SAME, AND WARSAW PACT STRENGTH HAS ALMOST
SURPASSED THAT OF THE WESTERN COUNTRIES. NOW, SOVIET SS-20S
ARE BEING DEPLOYED IN EUROPE. SOVIET GROUND-BASED NUCLEAR
WEAPONS ARE ALSO SUPERIOR TO THOSE IN EUROPE. DESPITE THE
TALK, THERE ARE MORE AND MORE NUCLEAR WEAPONS. THE SAME
APPLIES TO THE ARMY AND THE AIR FORCE. THE SOVIET NAVY IS
NOW NUMBER ONE IN THE WORLD. THE SOVIETS HAVE FOUR FLEETS,
AND THE NORTHERN FLEET IS VERY LARGE. YOU KNOW THIS BETTER
THAN I. THE SOVIET NAVY NOW REACHES WHEREVDY THERE IS SEA.
THE NUMBERS OF VIETNAMESE TROOPS HAVE ALMOST DOUBLED. THERE
WERE 400-500,000 AND NOW THERE ARE OVER ONE MILLION. SO
DESPITE DISARMAMENT TALKS, THERE ARE NO REDUCTIONS.
EVERY COUNTRY NEEDS MILITARY STRENGTH TO PROTECT ITS
OWN INTERESTS. WE EVEN SUPPORT MILITARY FORCES FOR JAPAN TO
PROTECT ITSELF. EACH COUNTRY HAS THE RIGHT TO PROTECT ITS
INDEPENDENCE AND SOVEREIGNTY. THIS IS ALLOWED. BUT IF YOU
SURPASS THESE LIMITS, THEN IT BECOMES A PROBLEM. THE SOVIETS
TALK, BUT THEY DO NOT REDUCE THEIR FORCES. THEY HAVE GREATLY
STRENGTHENED THEIR AIR, NAVY AND GROUND FORCES. THESE ARE
MY PERSONAL OPINIONS SINCE WE ARE JUST HAVING AN EXCHANGE OF
VIEWS. THERE ARE THOSE WHO HOPE THAT DETENTE WILL RELAX THE
WORLD SITUATION, BUT IT WILL ONLY BE USED BY THE SOVIETS

FOR THEIR OWN PURPOSES. WE MUST KEEP A COOL HEAD. YOU NOW
HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO SEE CHINA, AND YOU CAN EXCHANGE VIEWS
WITH US. I HOPE YOU WILL SEE MILITARY UNITS IN CHINA. PLEASE
GIVE US YOUR VALUABLE OPINIONS.
GARD: COULD WE ASK SOME QUESTIONS?
XU: AS YOU WISH.
Q: DURING VICE PREMIER TENG'S VISIT TO THE US, HE SPOKE TO
CONGRESS JUST BEFORE THE COUNTERATTACK AGAINST VIETNAM AND
SPOKE OF TEACHING VIETNAM A LESSON AND OF THE HOPE THAT
VIETNAM WOULD WITHDRAW FROM KAMPUCHEA. BUT THEY HAVE CONTINUED THEIR ATTACK. DID YOU REALIZE YOUR OBJECTIVE AND,
IF SO, WHAT DID YOU GAIN?
XU: THE PUNITIVE ACTION IN VIETNAM WAS TO TEACH THEM A LESSON
- TO LET THEM KNOW THAT THEY COULD NOT EXPAND THEIR OWN
INFLUENCE IN ALL AREAS AT WILL. NEGOTIATIONS ARE NOW GOING
ON, AND IN THE NEGOTIATIONS WE HAVE RAISED EIGHT POINTS
IN ORDER TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM. ONE OF THESE EIGHT POINTS
IS THAT VIETNAM SHOULD WITHDRAW ITS FORCES FROM KAMPUCHEA,
AND THAT IS ONE OF OUR NEGOTIATING AIMS. EVEN DURING THE
GROUND ATTACK WE DID NOT INTEND TO SEND OUR TROOPS TO HANOI.
OUR GOALS WERE LIMITED. WE JUST WANTED TO GIVE THEM A LESSON
THAT IT WOULD NOT DO TO INTRUDE INTO OTHER COUNTRIES AT
WILL. WE DID NOT HOPE THAT THE COUNTERATTACK WOULD FORCE
VIETNAM TO WITHDRAW FROM KAMPUCHEA. WE WOULD LIKE FOR THIS
TO HAPPEN OF COURSE, BUT THIS DEPENDS ON VIETNAM. NOW NEGOTIATIONS ARE GOING ON. KAMPUCHEA IS AN INDEPENDENT COUNTRY,
AND WE WOULD HOPE ITS BORDER PROBLEMS WITH VIETNAM COULD
BE SOLVED BY PEACEFUL NEGOTIATIONS. BUT VIETNAM HAS 15
DIVISIONS IN KAMPUCHEA, AND THE SOVIETS ARE HELPING THEM
TO TRANSPORT TROOPS. AS FOR THE FUTURE, WE MUST WAIT AND
SEE. IN VIETNAM THERE ARE GREAT ECONOMIC PROBLEMS. THEY
DO NOT HAVE ENOUGH FOOD. IF THEY DO NOT WITHDRAW, THEY MUST

SHOULDER THE BURDEN OF KAMPUCHEA. WE WILL SEE HOW LONG THEY
CAN BEAR IT. IN UNDERTAKING OUR PUNITIVE ACTION WE WOULD
HAVE LIKED FOR VIETNAM TO WITHDRAW FROM KAMPUCHEA BUT IT
DID NOT. AS REGARDS THE SINO-VIETNAMESE BORDER INCIDENT,
EVEN THE US GAVE ITS VIEWS AND SAID THAT VIETNAM AND CHINA
BOTH SHOULD WITHDRAW. VICE PREMIER TENG SAID THAT THIS WAS
A FAIR DEMAND. WE DID NOT WANT TO OCCUPY VIETNAM. THIS IS
NOT JUST A CHINESE PROBLEM, BUT AN INDO-CHINESE PROBLEM
AS WELL. VIETNAM WANTS TO SET UP AN INDO-CHINESE FEDERATION,

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
AND THE SOVIETS WANT AN ASIAN COLLECTIVE SECURITY SYSTEM.
IF THESE ARE COMBINED IT WILL BECOME A WORLD PROBLEM WHICH
INVOLVES THE COUNTRIES OF THE PACIFIC AND THE INDIAN OCEAN
AS WELL. WE HOPE THAT ALL COUNTRIES INCLUDING THE US WILL
WORK JOINTLY TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM.
I SHOULD ADD THAT EVEN AT THE BEGINNING OF THE COUNTERATTACK, CHINA DID NOT EXPECT VIETNAM TO WITHDRAW FROM KAMPUCHEA. IF VIETNAM HAD WITHDRAWN, THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN
BETTER BUT THINGS ARE NOT THAT SIMPLE. ANOTHER PURPOSE WAS
TO PUT ENOUGH MILITARY PRESSURE ON VIETNAM SO THAT IT WOULD
REDUCE ITS PRESSURE ON KAMPUCHEA AND GIVE KAMPUCHEA TIME

MILITARY STRENGTH CHINA WOULD LIKE TO SEE JAPAN DEVELOP)
XU: AS FOR THE MILITARY STRENGTH THAT JAPAN SHOULD HAVE TO
DEAL WITH THE SOVIET THREAT, THAT IS JAPAN'S INTERNAL AFFAIR.
OUR OPINION THAT JAPAN SHOULD HAVE ENOUGH STRENGTH FOR
DEFENSE IS NOT A NEW IDEA. THIS WAS ALSO CHINA'S VIEW WHEN
CHAIRMAN MAO AND PREMIER ZHOU WERE ALIVE. AFTER WORLD WAR
II, THERE WAS SOMETHING CALLED THE SAN FRANCISCO TREATY
WHICH BOTH CHINA AND THE US SIGNED. EVEN THE CONSTITUTION
OF JAPAN SAYS THAT JAPAN CANNOT HAVE ARMED FORCES. SO JAPAN
IS DEPRIVED OF THE RIGHT TO HAVE STRONG MILITARY FORCES.
WE SAID YEARS AGO THAT JAPAN SHOULD HAVE SUFFICIENT MILITARY
STRENGTH TO DEFEND ITS TERRITORY. AS TO HOW MUCH, THAT IS
ITS INTERNAL AFFAIR. THIS IS ONLY A SUGGESTION. THIS IS
NOT A NEW VIEW.
(AFTER THE INTERPRETER WAS CORRECTED)
AS FOR MILITARY RELATIONS BETWEEN JAPAN AND CHINA, JAPAN
SHOULD HAVE ENOUGH MILITARY STRENGTH TO DEFEND ITS TERRITORY
AND SOVEREIGNTTY. AS TO HOW WE SHOULD DEAL WITH THE SOVIET
THREAT, WE CAN DISCUSS AND NEGOTIATE ON THE PROBLEM. DEALING
WITH THE SOVIET UNION IS NOT A PROBLEM FOR ONE COUNTRY ONLY.
IT IS A WORLD-WIDE PROBLEM. ONLY THROUGH JOINT EFFORTS CAN
WE POSTPONE A WORLD WAR.
LET ME ADD A FEW WORDS. CHINA HAS ALREADY SIGNED A PEACE
AND FRIENDSHIP TREATY WITH JAPAN. WE ALSO HAD A FRIENDSHIP
AND COOPERATION TREATY WITH THE SOVIET UNION WHICH WAS
DIRECTED AGAINST JAPAN. THIS HAS ALREADY BEEN ABOLISHED.
JAPAN IS CAPITALIST AND WE ARE SOCIALIST, SO WE WILL NOT
JOIN IN A TREATY FOR DEFENSIVE PURPOSES. BUT DEALING WITH
THE SOVIET UNION IS NOT ONE COUNTRY'S PROBLEM. THE US IS
THE STRONGEST POWER, BUT IT IS NOT STRONG ENOUGH ALONE.

WE COULD NOT WIN, OUR SONS AND GRANDSONS WOULD CONTINUE
THE FIGHT. IN THE END WE WOULD SUCCEED BECAUSE CHINA IS

WE CANNOT JOIN JAPAN IN A MILITARY ALLIANCE OR ANYTHING
LIKE THAT. BUT THE SOVIET PROBLEM IS NOT FOR ONE COUNTRY
ALONE. ROY
