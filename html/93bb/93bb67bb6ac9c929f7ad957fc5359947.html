		<h3>Tor</h3>
		<p><a href="https://www.torproject.org">Tor</a> is an encrypted anonymising network that makes it harder to intercept internet communications, or see where communications are coming from or going to.</p>
		<p>In order to use the WikiLeaks public submission system as detailed above you can download the Tor Browser Bundle, which is a Firefox-like browser available for Windows, Mac OS X and GNU/Linux and pre-configured to connect using the anonymising system Tor.</p>
		<h4>Tails</h4>
		<p>If you are at high risk and you have the capacity to do so, you can also access the submission system through a secure operating system called <a href="https://tails.boum.org">Tails</a>. Tails is an operating system launched from a USB stick or a DVD that aim to leaves no traces when the computer is shut down after use and automatically routes your internet traffic through Tor. Tails will require you to have either a USB stick or a DVD at least 4GB big and a laptop or desktop computer.</p>

		<h3>Tips</h3>
		<p>Our submission system works hard to preserve your anonymity, but we recommend you also take some of your own precautions. Please review these basic guidelines. </p>
		<div>
			<h4>1. Contact us if you have specific problems</h4>
			<p>If you have a very large submission, or a submission with a complex format, or are a high-risk source, please <a href="#submit_help_contact">contact us</a>. In our experience it is always possible to find a custom solution for even the most seemingly difficult situations.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h4>2. What computer to use</h4>
			<p>If the computer you are uploading from could subsequently be audited in an investigation, consider using a computer that is not easily tied to you. Technical users can also use <a href="https://tails.boum.org">Tails</a> to help ensure you do not leave any records of your submission on the computer.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h4>3. Do not talk about your submission to others</h4>
			<p>If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in source protection – it is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This includes other media organisations.</p>
		</div>

	</div>

		<h3>After</h3>

		<div>
			<h4>1. Do not talk about your submission to others</h4>
			<p>If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in source protection – it is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This includes other media organisations.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h4>2. Act normal</h4>
			<p>If you are a high-risk source, avoid saying anything or doing anything after submitting which might promote suspicion. In particular, you should try to stick to your normal routine and behaviour.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h4>3. Remove traces of your submission</h4>
			<p>If you are a high-risk source and the computer you prepared your submission on, or uploaded it from, could subsequently be audited in an investigation, we recommend that you format and dispose of the computer hard drive and any other storage media you used.</p>
			<p>In particular, hard drives retain data after formatting which may be visible to a digital forensics team and flash media (USB sticks, memory cards and SSD drives) retain data even after a secure erasure. If you used flash media to store sensitive data, it is important to destroy the media.</p>
			<p>If you do this and are a high-risk source you should make sure there are no traces of the clean-up, since such traces themselves may draw suspicion.</p>
			<div>
				<h4>4. If you face legal action</h4>
				<p>If a legal action is brought against you as a result of your submission, there are organisations that may help you. The Courage Foundation is an international organisation dedicated to the protection of journalistic sources. You can find more details at <a href="https://www.couragefound.org">https://www.couragefound.org</a>.</p>

		<p>WikiLeaks publishes documents of political or historical importance that are censored or otherwise suppressed. We specialise in strategic global publishing and large archives.</p>
		<p>The following is the address of our secure site where you can anonymously upload your documents to WikiLeaks editors. You can only access this submissions system through Tor. (See our <a href="#submit_help_tor">Tor tab</a> for more information.) We also advise you to read our <a href="#submit_help_tips">tips for sources</a> before submitting.</p>

			<!--<div>
				Copy this address into your Tor browser. Advanced users, if they wish, can also add a further layer of encryption to their submission using <a href="#submit_wlkey">our public PGP key</a>.
			</div>-->
		</div>

		<p>If you cannot use Tor, or your submission is very large, or you have specific requirements, WikiLeaks provides several alternative methods. <a href="#submit_help_contact">Contact us</a> to discuss how to proceed.</p>

SUBJECT: CODEL PRICE MEETING WITH CHANG CHUN-CHIAO

REF: PEKING 723</div><div class="text-button" id="showhide">Show&nbsp;Headers</div><div class="text-content"><div id="tagged-text">
SUMMARY AND ASSESSMENT. IN NEARLY TWO-HOUR CONVERSATION
APRIL 20 WITH CODEL PRICE, VICE PREMIER CHANG CHUN-CHIAO WAS
QUESTIONED RATHER CLOSELY ON THE PRC'S DEFENSE POLICIES AND PLANNING.
HE LARGELY REITERATED THE FAMILIAR POLICY POINTS MADE TO THE GROUP
BY FOREIGN MINISTER CHIAO KUAN-HUA, INCLUDING THE KEY ONE,
WHERE THIS GROUP WAS CONCERNED, THAT CHINA'S DEFENSE POLICY IS
ESSENTIALLY SELF-RELIANT. HE WAS GENERALLY EVASIVE ABOUT DETAILS
OF CHINA'S DEFENSE BUDGET AND ITS IMPORTS OF MILITARY TECHNOLOGY,
BUT SAID THE BUDGET HAD INCREASED IF TUNNEL-BUILDING AND
MILITIA COSTS WERE INCLUDED, WHICH THEY NORMALLY ARE NOT.
HE INDICATED THE TUNNELS WERE AS MUCH FOR FIGHTING SOVIET
GROUND FORCES AS FOR AIR DEFENSE. HE REVEALED THAT NO ONE
HAD BEEN NAMED TO REPLACE TENG HSIAO-PING AS CHIEF OF THE
PLA GENERAL FHAFF, BUT PLAYED DOWN THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS
POSITION AND CLAIMED TENG HAD DONE LITTLE DURING
HIS INCUMBENCY. CHANG HIMSELF, PERHAPS IN PART TO GET OUT
FROM UNDER THE PERSISTENT QUESTIONING ON DEFENSE MATTERS,
RAISED THE TIEN AN MEN SQUARE INCIDENT. BUT HE MINIMIZED

ITS IMPORTANCE AND THEN WENT ON TO STRESS THE CONTINUITY OF
CHINESE POLICY AS DETERMINED BY CHAIRMAN MAO. AT THE
OUTSET CHANG (UNDOUBTEDLY AWARE THAT THE CODEL
HAD BEEN FAVORED WITH A PERFORMANCE OF THE TAIWAN SONG WHILE
VISITING A PLA INFANTRY DIVIDISON HEADQUARTERS) POINTED OUT
THAT NEXT DOOR TO THEIR MEETING PLACE IN THE GREAT HALL OF THE
PEOPLE WAS THE ROOM RESERVED FOR TAIWAN PROVINCE. HE DID
NOT RETURN TO THE SUBJECT OF TAIWAN, HOWEVER.

THE CODEL WAS NOT PLEASED WITH CHANG'S PERFORMANCE,
FINDING IT CONSIDERABLY LESS DIPLOMATIC THAN CHIAO'S HAD BEEN
(PARA 16). THE CODEL MEMBERS FOR THEIR PART CHALLENGED A
NUMBER OF THE STAPLE CHINESE THESES ABOUT THE SOVIET THREAT.
REP
WOLFF TOLD CHANG IN NO UNCERTAIN TERMS (PARA 9) THAT WHILE
WAR BETWEEN THE U.S. AND U.S.S.R. MIGHT BEGIN AS A CON-
VENTIONAL WAR, THE US WOULD USE EVERY MEANS AT ITS DISPOSAL
TO ASSURE VICTORY.

THE CODEL WAS DISAPPOINTED AT NOT MEETING WITH PREMIER
HUA KUO-FENG, WHO (AS A CHINESE OFFICIAL POINTED OUT TO US) WAS
BUSY WITH THE EGYPTIAN VICE PRESIDENT. BUT WHERE THE CHINESE
PUBLIC AND WORLD AUDIENCE ARE CONCERNED, THE WELL-PUBLICIZED
MEETING, BRINGING TOGETHER FOR THE FIRST TIME ONE OF THE TOP
FIGURES OF THE PRC'S POLITICAL LEFT FOR A &quot;FRIENDLY TALK&quot; WITH
AMERICAN OFFICIALS, MAY HAVE BEEN MEANT TO HAVE CONSIDERABLE
SYMBOLIC IMPORTANCE.

TANG WEN-SHENG(NANCY TANG), MFA DEPUTY
DEPARTMENT
DIRECTOR,  MOVED IN ON CHANG'S INTERPRETER SEVERAL
TIMES TO MAKE SURE CHANG GOT THE MAIN POINTS OF A CODEL
MEMBER'S REMARKS. VICE FOREIGN MINISTER WANG HAI-JUNG
WAS, AS SHE USUALLY IS ON SUCH OCCASIONS, A SILENT OBSERVER.
END SUMMARY AND ASSESSMENT.

1. TAIWAN. CODEL EARLIER HAD THAT AFTERNOON BEEN TAKEN ON A
TOUR OF THE GREAT HALL. PICKING UP A REFERENCE TO THIS BY
REP. PRICE IN THE OPENING PLEASANTRIES, CHANG SAID:
OUR NATIONAL PEOPLE'S CONGRESS IS HELD HERE. EACH
PROVINCE HAS ITS OWN. OVER THERE (POINTING) IS THE
CONFIDENTIAL

CONFIDENTIAL

PAGE 03  PEKING 00736  01 OF 04  221616Z

PROVINCE OF TAIAQN, BEYOND THIS DOOR. WHEN THE NPC
IS IN SESSION, DEPUTIES FROM THE DIFFERENT PROVINCES MEET
IN THEIR OWN HALLS, WHICH ARE DECORATED WITH SPECIALITIES
FROM THEIR OWN PROVINCE. THE BEST WAY TO TRAVEL IN
CHINA IS TO TOUR THE VARIOUS HALLS HERE.

2. ASKED BY REP. PRICE HOW HE
THOUGHT THE TWO COUNTRIES COULD WORK TOGETHER IN THE AREA OF
DEFENSE, AND WHAT THE REQUIREMENTS WERE FOR MUTUAL UNDER-
STANDING ON THE QUESTION OF SECURITY IN THIS PART OF THE WORLD,
CHANG SAID:
ON DEFENSE QUESTIONS OUR POLICY HAS BEEN STATED BY
FOREIGN MINISTER CHIAO. IN OUR COUNTRY, THE MILITARY
LINE IS SUBORDINATE TO THE DEFENSE LINE. (WE WORK FOR)
SOCIALIST REVOLUTION AND BUILDING UP OUR COUNTRY. WE
ALSO TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION THE OUTSIDE THREAT. AT
PRESENT THE BIGGEST THREAT COMES FROM OUR NEIGHBOR
TO THE NORTH. OUR WAY OF DEALING WITH THIS IS
TO RELY ON OURSELVES. IT IS CLEARLY STATED IN OUR CONSTI-
TUTION THAT CHINA FAVORS FRIENDLY RELATIONS WITH
SOCIALIST COUNTRIES, SUPPORTS REVOLUTIONARY STRUGGLES
AND WILL TAKE ACTIVE MEASURES AGAINST IMPERIALIST
AGGRESSION. I HAVE A QUESTION: WHAT IS THE U.S.
DOING IN THE PACIFIC, SINCE IT IS AGAINST THE U.S. THAT
THE USSR IS DIRECTING ITS SPEARHEAD IN THE
PACIFIC?

3. REP. PRICE'S RESPONSE NOTED THE PRIMACY OF NON-MILITARY CONCERNS
IN
THE US AND THE CONSEQUENT DIFFICLTIES OF KEEPING ADEQUATE US FORCES
IN
THE PACIFIC AND ELSEWHERE. IT ENDED WITH TWO QUESTIONS (THE
FIRST OF WHICH CHANG DID NOT GET AROUND TO ANSWERING): WHAT WAS
PRC'S ATTITUDE TOWARD US EFFORTS IN DIEGO GARCIA, AND &quot;WHAT
SHOULD WE BE DOING THAT WE ARE NOT DOING?

4. CHANG SAID HE THOUGHT
FOCUS OF US-USSR CONTENTION
WAS IN EUROPE AND THAT THE US SHOULD PAY MORE ATTENTION
TO EUROPE. THE SOVIETS HAD ACHIEVED THE LEAST IN ASIA AND THE
PACIFIC, BUT HAD MADE SOME HEADWAY IN AFRICA AND EUROPE. SOME

ABOUT THE SOVIET'S PRESENCE IN THE INDIAN OCEAN AND THEIR
BUILDING OF A POWERFUL NAVY. CHANG SAID THAT THIS FIRST OF ALL
CONCERNED THE US AS THE SOVIET NAVAL EXPANSION SHOWED
THAT THE DANGER OF WAR WAS GROWING.

6. REP WOLFF OBSERVED THAT ALTHOUGH THE VICE PREMIER HAD
SAID THE SOVIETS DIDN'T POSE A THREAT OF ENCIRCLEMENT, THERE
WERE MANY SOVIET DIVISIONS ON CHINA'S BORDERS. IF THE NUMBER
OF SOVIET TROOPS INTHE WEST, FACING EUROPE, WERE LESSENED, IT
WOULD MEAN MORE AVAILABLE TO FACE CHINA, SO THAT THERE WAS
A OBLANIONSHIP. CHANG SAID HE AGREED, OF COURSE THERE WAS A
RELATIONSHIP, BUT ASKED IF IT WASN'T SO THAT THE MAIN BODY OF
SOVIET TROOPS WAS IN EUROPE. REP. PRICE ASKED IF CHANG WAS
SAYING THERE WAS NO CONCERN IN CHINA OR IN THIS PART OF
THE WORLD OVER A THREAT FROM THE SOVIET UNION.

7. CHANG INSISTED THAT FROM A GLOBAL POINT OF VIEW, THE FOCUS
OF THE SOVIET THREAT REMAINED IN EUROPE. REP. STRATTON
COMMENTED THAT THE CODEL'S REASON FOR BEING HERE WAS
ITS RECOGNITION OF A SOVIET THREAT TO PEACE THROUGHOUT THE WORLD,
IN EUROPE AND ELSEWHERE, AND ITS FEELING THAT CHINA
SHARED THIS VIEW. THERE
WAS NO SENSE IN ARGUING OVER WHETHER

PAGE 02  PEKING 00736  02 OF 04  221557Z

THE THREAT WAS IN EUROPE OR THE PACIFIC; THOSE WHO RECOGNIZED
THE THREAT SHOULD WORK TOGETHER TO DETER IT FROM ERUPTING HERE
OR THERE. HE INVITED CHANG'S SUGGESTIONS ON DEALING WITH THE
THREAT. CHANG:
WE ARE IN AGREEMENT THAT THE SOVIETS ARE A THREAT TO
THE WORLD AND NOT JUST TO A SPECIFIC REGION. WHERE
YOU DON'T AGREE WITH US IS ON THE POINT THAT THE FOCUS IS IN
EUROPE. ...SINCE MOST OF YOU ARE MEMBERS OF THE
HOUSE ARMED SERVICES COMMITTEE YOU MUST
CONSIDER THAT WAR BREAKS OUT WHERE THE FOCUS IS.
ANY MILITARY MAN UNDERSTANDS THIS. THERE'S NO
NEED FOR ARGUMENT ON THIS POINT. EACH SIDE (THE US AND PRC) SHOULD
ACT IN ITS OWN WAY. WE CANNOT MAKE SUGGESTIONS ON
HOW THE US SHOULD BUILD ITS FORCES, AND VICE VERSA.
WE HAVE DIFFERENT SOCIAL SYSTEMS. ONE POINT IN
COMMON IS THAT WE MUST DEAL WITH THE SOVIET UNION.

8. REP. STRATTON SAID THE CODEL HAD THE IMPRESSION FROM EARLIER
CONGRESSIONAL GROUPS THAT THE PRC FELT THE US SHOULD REMAIN IN
THE PACIFIC AND NOT WITHDRAW ITS FORCES BECAUSE OF DETENTE. IF
THE US REMAINED STRONG IN THE PACIFIC THIS WOULD REDUCE THE
LIKELIHOOD OF WAR. TO SAY THAT THE PRC DIDN'T CARE WHAT THE US
DID SUGGESTED THE PRC'S POSITION HAD CHANGED; THAT IT WOULD MAKE
NO DIFFERENCE IF THE US WITHDREW FROM KOREA AND GUAM BACK
TO PEARL HARBOR. WAS THIS REALLY THE PRC POSITION?
TANG WEN-SHENG INTERJECTED THAT THE QUESTION WAS ESPECIALLY
ON WHETHER PRC POLICY HAD CHANGED. CHANG:
WE HAVE STATED OUR POSITION OFTEN ON THIS QUESTION
AND OUR VIEWS HAVE NOT CHANGED. AS FOR KOREA,
WE HAVE ALSO STATED OUR POSITION. SINCE THE KOREAN
PEOPLE DON'T APPROVE OF YOUR PRESENCE, HOW CAN WE
SAY WE APPROVE. AS I'VE SAID, IN THE PACIFIC THE
SPEARHEAD OF THE SOVIETS IS DIRECTED AT THE U.S. AND THE
US OUGHT TO FIND A WAY TO DEAL WITH IT. YOUR PRESENCE
IN THE PACIFIC IS A FACT AND THE SOVIETS ARE TRYING TO
SQUEEZE YOU OUT. WE ALSO FAVOR FRIENDLY US-JAPAN
RELATIONS. WE DON'T SAY THIS QUESTION IS OF NO CONCERN
TO US. THAT'S NOT WHAT I MEAN.
STRATTON, FOLLOWING UP, PRESSED FOR BETTER MUTUAL UNDERSTANDING OF
MILITARY POLICIES, ON THE BASIS OF WHICH POSITIONS COULD BE
ESTABLISHED IN THE PACIFIC THAT WOULD DETER THE SOVIETS. HE
CONFIDENTIAL

PAGE 03  PEKING 00736  02 OF 04  221557Z

REMARKED THAT IF THE US WITHDREW FROM KOREA AND JAPAN THIS
WOULD BE AN INVITATION FOR THE SOVIETS TO MOVE IN. CHANG:
I THINK WE SHOULDN'T ARGUE THE POINT. IN KOREA
THE PEOPLE WILL SETTLE THE QUESTION. WE DON'T BELIEVE
IN A VACUUM THERE. (NOTE: CHANG APPARENTLY
MEANT CHINESE DO NOT BELIEVE US WITHDRAWAL FROM
KOREA WOULD CREATE A VACUUM THERE.)
REP. DICKINSON, NOTED PRESSURES ON CONGRESS AND HOUSE ARMED
SERVICES COMMITTEE FOR PAST SEVERAL YEARS TO WITHDRAW TROOPDUFROM
EUROPE AND PACIFIC AND ESPECIALLY KOREA. HE ASKED WHAT
CHINESE REACTION WOULD BE IF US FORCES WERE WITHDRAWAN FROM
KOREA. TANG &quot;CLARIFIED&quot; THE QUESTION. CHANG:
AT PRESENT YOU ARE NOT PREPARING TO WITHDRAW RROOPS.
IF YOU WITHDRAW THEM, THE KOREAN PEOPLE WILL BE
PLEASED. WE CANNOT ADVISE YOU ON EVERY QUESTION OF
WHERE YOU SHOULD AND SHOULDN'T WITHDRAW, BUT ON THE
WHOLE THE US HAS SCATTERED ITS STRENGTH THROUGHOUT
THE WORLD. THE QUESTION IS, WHERE IS THE FOCUS. IN A
WAR, IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHERE THE FOCUS IS, HOW CAN
YOU FIGHT? SHOULD THE US CLOSE TEN FINGERS TO FORM
A FIST OR SHOULD IT TRY TO HOLD DOWN TEN FLEAS WITH TEN
FINGERS?
REP. WILSON COMMENTED THAT THE FOCUS OF THE US WAS
ON SOVIET INTENTIONS. CITING THE EXTRA FUNDS VOTED BY CONGRESS
FOR SHIPS INCLUDING THE TRIDENT SUBMARINE, HE NOTED THAT IF
THE SOVIETS GAINED NAVAL SUPREMACY THEY COULD INTERDICT THE
MOVEMENT OF OIL TO JAPAN THOUGH MALACCA STRAITS. CHANG
ASKED IF THE US OR THE USSR WERE STRONGER IN NAVAL
FORCES. REP. PRICE SAID THE US WAS STRONGER; REP. WILSON
ADDED &quot;AT PRESENT.&quot; REP. PRICE SAID WE WERE TAKING STEPS, E.G.
THE NAVAL BUDGET INCREASES, TO SEE THAT THIS CONTINUED
TO BE THE CASE. CHANG ASKED WHICH SIDE WOULD BE STRONGER.
THE USSR OR THE US AND ITS ALLIES, IF THERE WERE A
CONVENTIONAL WAR IN EUROPE. REP. PRICE SAID IT WAS A QUESTION OF
POTENTIAL FORCES, NOT THOSE NOW IN BEING. HISTORY HAD SHOWN
THE US COULD BUILD UP ITS FORCES QUICKLY WHEN FIGHTING STARTED.
WE HAD ENTERED BOTH WORLD WARS WITH NO FORCES TO SPEAK OF.
SINCE WORLD WAR II WE HAD MAINTAINED HIGHER FORCES THAN USUAL
GECAUSE OF THYSSOVIET THREAT. THE US COULD EXPAND ITS FORCES
QUICKLY BUT INTHE MEANTIME MUST KEEP UP ITS R &amp; D EFFORTS.

EUROPE AS PART OF THE NATO ARRANGEMENTS, BUT WE WERE NOT
MAINTAINING LARGE FORCES THERE OR ANYWHERE ELSE EITHER.

9. REP. WOLFF THEN SAID WE COULD ASSUME THAT IF WAR AROSE IT
WOULD NOT BE SELECTIVE; THERE WAS NO CONTROLLING WHERE THE DOGS
OF WAR WOULD BITE ONCE THEY WERE UNLEASHED. WORLD

NUCLEAR WEAPONS. ONE COULD ASSUME IHAT THERE WOULD BE NO
US-SOVIET WAR THAT WOULD NOT ESCALATE TO NUCLEAR WAR.
RECALLING THAT FOREIGN MINISTER CHIAO HAD SAID WAR WAS
INEVITABLE, REP. WOLFF SAID THAT INSTEAD OF ENGAGING IN
POLEMICS OVER WHERE THE WAR WOULD START, WE SHOULD TRY TO FIND
MEANS OF POSTPONING IT, BECAUSE IF WAR CAME IT WOULD BE A
DISASTER FOR THE WHOLE WORLD. NEITHER CHINA NOR THE US
COULD STAY OUT. THOUGH HE WAS OPPOSED TO NUCLEAR WAR AND HAD
BEEN A DOVE ON VIETNAM, WOLFF SAID, THE US WOULD NOT BE
DEFEATED BY THE USSR AND WOULD RESORT TO ANY MEANS TO
ACHIEVE VICTORY. TANG EXPLAINED THE MEANING OF &quot;DOVE.&quot; CHANG:
WHEN WAR BREAKS OUT, IT WILL DEVELOP ACCORDING TO ITS
OWN LAW. THERE IS ALSO A LAW OF DEVELOPMENT AS TO WHERE
THE DOGS WILL BITE. IT IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE DOGS TO BITE
IN EVERY CORNER OF THE GLOBE. I THINK IT WILL BITE IN
EUROPE. THE OVERALL SITUATION IS TENSE, IN EUROPE
AND ELSEWHERE.
CHANG ARGUED THAT APOLICY OF ACCOMMODATING, APPEASING THE SOVIETS
WOULD ONLY ACCELERATE THE OUTBREAK OF WAR. HE WENT ON:
FROM OUR EXPERIENCE WITH THEM, WE SEE THAT THE SOVIETS
BULLY THE SOFT AND FEAR THE TOUGH. WE HAVE SAID THAT
CHINA IS A PIECE OF MEAT THAT THE SOVIETS WANT TO BITE.
BUT THE BONES IN THE MEAT ARE TOO TOUGH.

THEY
WILL BREAK OFF THE SOVIETS' TEETH. THIS IS OUR VIEW.

10. REP. WHITEHURST ASKED WHAT AREAS CHINA CONCENTRATED ON
TO MAKE THE SOVIETS UNWILLING TO ATTACK. WOULD CHINA INCREASE
ITS MILITARY BUDGET AS THE US WAS DOING? MENTIONING THE
CODEL'S VISIT TO AN INFANTRY DIVISION (SEPTEL),
HE ASKED WHAT OTHER AREAS THE PRC WAS CONENTRATING ON--
DID THEY ENVISAGE A GUERILLA WAR TO DEAL WITH THE SOVIET THREAT,
OR MORE SOPHISTICATED WEAPONS? CHANG:
OUR POLICY IS VERY SIMPLE: IT IS PEOPLE'S WAR. THIS
INCLUDES CONVENTIONAL WAR AND GUERILLA WARFARE. YET
YOU SAW OUR DIVISION; OBVIOUSLY IT WILL FIGHT A REGULAR
WAR. BUT OUR LARGEST FORCE IS OUR MILITIA. TO
A CONSIDEIIBLE EXTENT, THOSE WITH THE GREATEST
EXPERIENCE OF WAR ARE AT LOCAL LEVELS. IF WE CALL FOR
MOBILIZATION, WE CAN MOBILIZE TENS OF MILLIONS OF
TROOPS IN A SHORT TIME. AND HAVE MANY CADRES WITH
EXPERIENCEIN WAR. HOW WE FIGHT WILL DEPEND ON HOW
THE WAR ARISES. IT'S NO SECRET WE CONCENTRATE OUR
FORCES AGAINST THE NORTH.
REP. WHITEHURST AGAIN ASKED IF THE PRC MILITARY BUDGET,
LIKE THE US WAS INCREASING. CHANG:
OUR BUDGET LIKE YOURS IS DIFFICULT TO ESTIIMATE.
IT IS HARD TO TELL WHAT IS MILITARY AND WHAT ISN'T
THE CONCEPTS OF OUR TWO COUNTRIES DIFFER. WE ARE
BUILDING MANY AIRRAID SHELTERS WHICH ARE NOT IN
THE BUDGET. OUR MILITIA EXERCISE DAILY; THIS IS
NOT IN THE BUDGET. OUR MILITARY INDUSTRY ALSO
MANUFACTURES CIVILIAN PRODUCTS, AND CIVILIAN INDUSTRIES
CAN MAKE GUNS. ORDINARY FACTORIES ARE ABLE TO MAKE
RIFLES AND ANTI-AIRCRAFT ARTILLERY.
MANY MILITIA CAN REPAIR THEIR OWN WEAPONS AND
COMMUNES CAN MAKE MINES AND GUNPOWDER. ALL
THIS IS NOT IN THE BUDGET. OUR BUDGET FLUCTUATES
LITTLE, AND EVEN IF IT INCREASES THE AMOUNT WON'T BE
MUCH. BUT IF YOU INCLUDE AIRRAID SHELTERS AND MILITIA
IT IS A BIG INCREASE. IN THE US THERE IS DEBATE IN
CONGRESS OVER INCREASING THE BUDGET. THAT DOESN'T
HAPPEN IN CHINA. YOU HAVE TO VOTE. WE DON'T.

11. REP. ICHORD OBSERVED
THAT IT WAS HARD FOR OUR TWO COUNTRIES TO
UNDERSTAND EACH OTHER'S POLITICAL PROCESS. TENG HSIAO-PING
BEING NO LONGER PLA CHIEF OF GENERAL STAFF, HAD THE POSITION
BEEN FILLED, AND BY WHOM? CHANG:
OUR MILITARY AS FOUNDED BY CHAIRMANOMAO IS ALWAYS
UNDER PARTY LEADERSHIP. OUR CENTRAL COMMITTEE'S
MILITARY COMMISSION IS IN CHATHR OF THE ARMED
FORCES; ITS CHAIRMAN IS CHAIRMAN MAO. I CAN SAY
THAT TENG IS NO LONGER CHIEF OF GENERAL STAFF BUT
THERE HAS BEEN NO NEW APPOINTMENT. IT DOESN'T
MATTER WHETHER WE HAVE A CHIEF OF GENERAL STAFF. IN OUR COUNTRY WEDIDN'T
HAVE ONE FOR SEVERAL
YEARS. I CAN SAY THAT WHEN TENG WAS CHIEF OF
GENERAL STAFF HE DID LITTLE IN THAT CAPACITY, BUT
PLEASE DON'T LET THIS GET OUT.

12. RESPONDING TO AN APPROVING
COMMENT BY REP. WILSON ON THE PRC'S TUNNEL PROGRAM, AND
REP. WILSON'S SUGGESTION THAT CHINA EXPECTED SOME NUCLEAR
WARFARE WITH THE RUSSIANS, CHANG SAID:
WHEN WE DIG TUNNELS, WE AIM NOT ONLY AT PREVENTING
AIR RAIDS. WE ASSUME EVERY CITY MUST FIGHT THE WAR.
WHEN THE SOVIETS COME, EVERY CITY MUST FIGHT. THE
TUNNELS
ARE PART OF OUR PREPAREDNESS FOR FIGHTING.
DURING THE JAPANESE OCCUPATION MANY VILLAGES HAD
UNDERGROUND TUNNELS. THE JAPANESE HAD THEIR
FORH ESSES #
ABOVE, BUT THEY COULDN'T ESTABLISH
CONTROL. AS FOR NUCLEAR WEAPONS, OF COURSE WE CARRY
ON RESEARCH, MAINLY BECAUSE IF WE DON'T SOME PEOPLE
WILL TRY TO OULVQ#AND INTIMIDATE US. NOW WE CAN SAY
YOU HAVE THEM(NUCLEAR WEAPONS) AND WE HAVE THEM.
BUT WE HAVE ONLY A FEW, AND EVEN IN THE FUTURE WE
WON'T HAVE AS MANY AS YOU. YOU AND THE SOVIETS
HAVE A GREAT MANY, MORE THAN CHINA HAS. BUT IF
THERE ARE TOO MANY, THERE IS NOT MUCH USE FOR THEM.

IN OUR GOVERNMENT, THERE IS SPECULATION THAT THESE
WILL BRING PROBLEMS AND CHANGES IN POLICY. IMPACT
AND CHANGE IN PREMIER CAME ABOUT BECAUSE PREMIER
CHOU DIED, AND NOT BECAUSE OF ANY GREAT INTERNAL
PROBLEMS. THE CHANGES IN THE GOVERNMENTAL LEADER-
SHIP AND STAFF MEMBERS ARE NOT DIRECTLY CONNECTED
WITH POLICY. IN OUR COUNTRY THE LINE AND POLICY ARE
FORMULATED BY CHAIRMAN MAO. CHAIRMAN
MAO FORMULATED OUR LINE AND POLICY ON MARXIST-
LENINIST PRINCIPLES AND PRACTICAL ANALYSIS OF THE WORLD
SITUATION. I WILL GIVE YOU EXAMPLES TO SHOW THAT CHANGES
IN PERSONNEL WON'T MEAN CHANGES IN POLICY. TAKE SINO-
SOVIET RELATIONS. WHEN WE HAD FRIENDLY RELATIONS,
CHOU EN-LAI WAS PREMIER. WHEN CHINA AND THE USSR
HAD A FALLING OUT, CHOU EN-LAI REMAINED PREMIER. THE
SAME PERSON WAS PREMIER BUT THE POLICY CHANGED. IT
CHANGED BECAUSE THE SITUATION CHANGED, BOTH THE ONE IN
CHINA. AND IN THE SOVIET UNION, BREZHNEV REPLACED
KHRUSCHEV, BUT THE LINE AND POLICY WERE NOT CHANGED.
SO,IN THIS QUESTION LOOK AT THE LINE AND POLICY OF A
COUNTRY, NOT AT CHANGES IN PERSONNEL, I READ THAT
BREZHNEV IS IN POOR HEALTH AND WILL BE REPLACED AND
THEN THERE WILL BE A CHANGE IN SOVIET POLICY. I THINK
THEIR POLICY WON'T CHANGE. US-PRC RELATIONS

14. REP. RANDALL, AFTER TOUCHING ON VARIOUS POINTS COVERED
EARLIER IN THE CONVERSATION, ASKED IF IT WAS TRUE THAT THE PRC
WAS BUYING SOME ARMAMENT MATERIALS FROM ABROAD. CHANG:
OUR POLICY, AS YOU UNDERSTAND WELL, IS SELF-RELIANCE
AND INDEPENDENCE. AS FOR MILITARY MATERIALS, WE
BUY SOME AND WE SELL SOME. WE SELL SOME MILITARY
MATERIALS AND WE BUY SOME. IT IS HARD TO DEFINE
WHICH ARE MILITARY MATERIALS AND WHICH ARE NOT. SOME
SAY THIS OR THAT IS OF A MILITARY NATURE AND WE MAY NOT
CONSIDER IT SO. OTHERS THINK SOME THINGS ARE NOT OF
A STRATEGIC FUTURE AND WE THINK THEY ARE. GRAIN IS
AN IMPORTANT STRATEGIC MATERIAL. IF SOLDIERS CAN'T EAT,
THEY CAN'T FIGHT. IT IS TRUE THAT WE BUY SOME MILITARY
MATERIALS BUT WE MAINLY RELY ON OURSELVES. FROM
OUR EXPERIENCE OF TWO DECADES, WE RELY ON OUR OWN
EFFORTS TO BUILD OUR MILITARY INDUSTRY, NUCLEAR INCLUDED.
IF THERE IS A BLOCKADE AND PEOPLE REFUSE TO SELL US
WEAPONS, WE ARE PLEASED BECAUSE WE'LL RELY ON OUR-
SELVES AND WHEN WE RELY ON OURSELVES WE CAN
ACCOMPLISH THESE TASKS. &quot;NOTHING IS HARD IF YOU
DARE TO SCALE THE HEIGHTS,&quot; AND THE CHINESE PEOPLE
ARE DOING THIS.

15. REP. PRICE EXPRESSED THANKS ON BEHALF OF ALL. CHANG
SAID HE TOO HAD APPRECIATED THE CANDID EXCHANGE OF VIEWS,
WHICH WOULD PROMOTE MUTUAL UNDERSTANDING. BUT BECAUSE THE
DISCUSSION HAD BEEN SO FRANK, HE REQUESTED THAT IT NOT BE
PUBLISHED. REP. PRICE ASSURED HIM THE DISCUSSION WOULD NOT
BE PUT ON THE RECORD. CHANG ADDED:
IF YOU DON'T PUBLISH AND IF YOU COME AGAIN WE
CAN HAVE A FREE EXCHANGE. IF YOU PUBLISH, WE WILL
REFRAIN FROM TALKING (FRANKLY) NEXT TIME.

16. ATMOSPHERICS. NCNA'S REPORT OF THE MEETING DESCRIBED

REPS. PRICE AND WOLFF BOTH COMMENTED TO US THAT THEY FELT

OF HIS REMARKS, WHICH SEEMED AT TIMES UNNECESSARILY
DIDACTIC OR GRATUITOUSLY NEGATIVE, A COUPLE OF CHANG'S PERSONAL

E.O.11652: XGDS-1
TAGS: PFOR, CH, US, UR, PINT, OREP (PRICE, MELVIN)
SUBJECT: CODEL PRICE MEETING WITH CHANG CHUN-CHIAO

REF: PEKING 723

SUMMARY AND ASSESSMENT. IN NEARLY TWO-HOUR CONVERSATION
APRIL 20 WITH CODEL PRICE, VICE PREMIER CHANG CHUN-CHIAO WAS
QUESTIONED RATHER CLOSELY ON THE PRC'S DEFENSE POLICIES AND PLANNING.
HE LARGELY REITERATED THE FAMILIAR POLICY POINTS MADE TO THE GROUP
BY FOREIGN MINISTER CHIAO KUAN-HUA, INCLUDING THE KEY ONE,
WHERE THIS GROUP WAS CONCERNED, THAT CHINA'S DEFENSE POLICY IS
ESSENTIALLY SELF-RELIANT. HE WAS GENERALLY EVASIVE ABOUT DETAILS
OF CHINA'S DEFENSE BUDGET AND ITS IMPORTS OF MILITARY TECHNOLOGY,
BUT SAID THE BUDGET HAD INCREASED IF TUNNEL-BUILDING AND
MILITIA COSTS WERE INCLUDED, WHICH THEY NORMALLY ARE NOT.
HE INDICATED THE TUNNELS WERE AS MUCH FOR FIGHTING SOVIET
GROUND FORCES AS FOR AIR DEFENSE. HE REVEALED THAT NO ONE
HAD BEEN NAMED TO REPLACE TENG HSIAO-PING AS CHIEF OF THE
PLA GENERAL FHAFF, BUT PLAYED DOWN THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS
POSITION AND CLAIMED TENG HAD DONE LITTLE DURING
HIS INCUMBENCY. CHANG HIMSELF, PERHAPS IN PART TO GET OUT
FROM UNDER THE PERSISTENT QUESTIONING ON DEFENSE MATTERS,
RAISED THE TIEN AN MEN SQUARE INCIDENT. BUT HE MINIMIZED
CONFIDENTIAL

CONFIDENTIAL

PAGE 02  PEKING 00736  01 OF 04  221616Z

ITS IMPORTANCE AND THEN WENT ON TO STRESS THE CONTINUITY OF
CHINESE POLICY AS DETERMINED BY CHAIRMAN MAO. AT THE
OUTSET CHANG (UNDOUBTEDLY AWARE THAT THE CODEL
HAD BEEN FAVORED WITH A PERFORMANCE OF THE TAIWAN SONG WHILE
VISITING A PLA INFANTRY DIVIDISON HEADQUARTERS) POINTED OUT
THAT NEXT DOOR TO THEIR MEETING PLACE IN THE GREAT HALL OF THE
PEOPLE WAS THE ROOM RESERVED FOR TAIWAN PROVINCE. HE DID
NOT RETURN TO THE SUBJECT OF TAIWAN, HOWEVER.

THE CODEL WAS NOT PLEASED WITH CHANG'S PERFORMANCE,
FINDING IT CONSIDERABLY LESS DIPLOMATIC THAN CHIAO'S HAD BEEN
(PARA 16). THE CODEL MEMBERS FOR THEIR PART CHALLENGED A
NUMBER OF THE STAPLE CHINESE THESES ABOUT THE SOVIET THREAT.
REP
WOLFF TOLD CHANG IN NO UNCERTAIN TERMS (PARA 9) THAT WHILE
WAR BETWEEN THE U.S. AND U.S.S.R. MIGHT BEGIN AS A CON-
VENTIONAL WAR, THE US WOULD USE EVERY MEANS AT ITS DISPOSAL
TO ASSURE VICTORY.

THE CODEL WAS DISAPPOINTED AT NOT MEETING WITH PREMIER
HUA KUO-FENG, WHO (AS A CHINESE OFFICIAL POINTED OUT TO US) WAS
BUSY WITH THE EGYPTIAN VICE PRESIDENT. BUT WHERE THE CHINESE
PUBLIC AND WORLD AUDIENCE ARE CONCERNED, THE WELL-PUBLICIZED
MEETING, BRINGING TOGETHER FOR THE FIRST TIME ONE OF THE TOP
FIGURES OF THE PRC'S POLITICAL LEFT FOR A &quot;FRIENDLY TALK&quot; WITH
AMERICAN OFFICIALS, MAY HAVE BEEN MEANT TO HAVE CONSIDERABLE
SYMBOLIC IMPORTANCE.

TANG WEN-SHENG(NANCY TANG), MFA DEPUTY
DEPARTMENT
DIRECTOR,  MOVED IN ON CHANG'S INTERPRETER SEVERAL
TIMES TO MAKE SURE CHANG GOT THE MAIN POINTS OF A CODEL
MEMBER'S REMARKS. VICE FOREIGN MINISTER WANG HAI-JUNG
WAS, AS SHE USUALLY IS ON SUCH OCCASIONS, A SILENT OBSERVER.
END SUMMARY AND ASSESSMENT.

1. TAIWAN. CODEL EARLIER HAD THAT AFTERNOON BEEN TAKEN ON A
TOUR OF THE GREAT HALL. PICKING UP A REFERENCE TO THIS BY
REP. PRICE IN THE OPENING PLEASANTRIES, CHANG SAID:
OUR NATIONAL PEOPLE'S CONGRESS IS HELD HERE. EACH
PROVINCE HAS ITS OWN. OVER THERE (POINTING) IS THE
CONFIDENTIAL

CONFIDENTIAL

PAGE 03  PEKING 00736  01 OF 04  221616Z

PROVINCE OF TAIAQN, BEYOND THIS DOOR. WHEN THE NPC
IS IN SESSION, DEPUTIES FROM THE DIFFERENT PROVINCES MEET
IN THEIR OWN HALLS, WHICH ARE DECORATED WITH SPECIALITIES
FROM THEIR OWN PROVINCE. THE BEST WAY TO TRAVEL IN
CHINA IS TO TOUR THE VARIOUS HALLS HERE.

2. ASKED BY REP. PRICE HOW HE
THOUGHT THE TWO COUNTRIES COULD WORK TOGETHER IN THE AREA OF
DEFENSE, AND WHAT THE REQUIREMENTS WERE FOR MUTUAL UNDER-
STANDING ON THE QUESTION OF SECURITY IN THIS PART OF THE WORLD,
CHANG SAID:
ON DEFENSE QUESTIONS OUR POLICY HAS BEEN STATED BY
FOREIGN MINISTER CHIAO. IN OUR COUNTRY, THE MILITARY
LINE IS SUBORDINATE TO THE DEFENSE LINE. (WE WORK FOR)
SOCIALIST REVOLUTION AND BUILDING UP OUR COUNTRY. WE
ALSO TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION THE OUTSIDE THREAT. AT
PRESENT THE BIGGEST THREAT COMES FROM OUR NEIGHBOR
TO THE NORTH. OUR WAY OF DEALING WITH THIS IS
TO RELY ON OURSELVES. IT IS CLEARLY STATED IN OUR CONSTI-
TUTION THAT CHINA FAVORS FRIENDLY RELATIONS WITH
SOCIALIST COUNTRIES, SUPPORTS REVOLUTIONARY STRUGGLES
AND WILL TAKE ACTIVE MEASURES AGAINST IMPERIALIST
AGGRESSION. I HAVE A QUESTION: WHAT IS THE U.S.
DOING IN THE PACIFIC, SINCE IT IS AGAINST THE U.S. THAT
THE USSR IS DIRECTING ITS SPEARHEAD IN THE
PACIFIC?

3. REP. PRICE'S RESPONSE NOTED THE PRIMACY OF NON-MILITARY CONCERNS
IN
THE US AND THE CONSEQUENT DIFFICLTIES OF KEEPING ADEQUATE US FORCES
IN
THE PACIFIC AND ELSEWHERE. IT ENDED WITH TWO QUESTIONS (THE
FIRST OF WHICH CHANG DID NOT GET AROUND TO ANSWERING): WHAT WAS
PRC'S ATTITUDE TOWARD US EFFORTS IN DIEGO GARCIA, AND &quot;WHAT
SHOULD WE BE DOING THAT WE ARE NOT DOING?

4. CHANG SAID HE THOUGHT
FOCUS OF US-USSR CONTENTION
WAS IN EUROPE AND THAT THE US SHOULD PAY MORE ATTENTION
TO EUROPE. THE SOVIETS HAD ACHIEVED THE LEAST IN ASIA AND THE
PACIFIC, BUT HAD MADE SOME HEADWAY IN AFRICA AND EUROPE. SOME

5. REPRESENTATIVE PRICE ASKED IF CHINESE HAD NO CONCERN
ABOUT THE SOVIET'S PRESENCE IN THE INDIAN OCEAN AND THEIR
BUILDING OF A POWERFUL NAVY. CHANG SAID THAT THIS FIRST OF ALL
CONCERNED THE US AS THE SOVIET NAVAL EXPANSION SHOWED
THAT THE DANGER OF WAR WAS GROWING.

6. REP WOLFF OBSERVED THAT ALTHOUGH THE VICE PREMIER HAD
SAID THE SOVIETS DIDN'T POSE A THREAT OF ENCIRCLEMENT, THERE
WERE MANY SOVIET DIVISIONS ON CHINA'S BORDERS. IF THE NUMBER
OF SOVIET TROOPS INTHE WEST, FACING EUROPE, WERE LESSENED, IT
WOULD MEAN MORE AVAILABLE TO FACE CHINA, SO THAT THERE WAS
A OBLANIONSHIP. CHANG SAID HE AGREED, OF COURSE THERE WAS A
RELATIONSHIP, BUT ASKED IF IT WASN'T SO THAT THE MAIN BODY OF
SOVIET TROOPS WAS IN EUROPE. REP. PRICE ASKED IF CHANG WAS
SAYING THERE WAS NO CONCERN IN CHINA OR IN THIS PART OF
THE WORLD OVER A THREAT FROM THE SOVIET UNION.

7. CHANG INSISTED THAT FROM A GLOBAL POINT OF VIEW, THE FOCUS
OF THE SOVIET THREAT REMAINED IN EUROPE. REP. STRATTON
COMMENTED THAT THE CODEL'S REASON FOR BEING HERE WAS
ITS RECOGNITION OF A SOVIET THREAT TO PEACE THROUGHOUT THE WORLD,
IN EUROPE AND ELSEWHERE, AND ITS FEELING THAT CHINA
SHARED THIS VIEW. THERE
WAS NO SENSE IN ARGUING OVER WHETHER
CONFIDENTIAL

CONFIDENTIAL

PAGE 02  PEKING 00736  02 OF 04  221557Z

THE THREAT WAS IN EUROPE OR THE PACIFIC; THOSE WHO RECOGNIZED
THE THREAT SHOULD WORK TOGETHER TO DETER IT FROM ERUPTING HERE
OR THERE. HE INVITED CHANG'S SUGGESTIONS ON DEALING WITH THE
THREAT. CHANG:
WE ARE IN AGREEMENT THAT THE SOVIETS ARE A THREAT TO
THE WORLD AND NOT JUST TO A SPECIFIC REGION. WHERE
YOU DON'T AGREE WITH US IS ON THE POINT THAT THE FOCUS IS IN
EUROPE. ...SINCE MOST OF YOU ARE MEMBERS OF THE
HOUSE ARMED SERVICES COMMITTEE YOU MUST
CONSIDER THAT WAR BREAKS OUT WHERE THE FOCUS IS.
ANY MILITARY MAN UNDERSTANDS THIS. THERE'S NO
NEED FOR ARGUMENT ON THIS POINT. EACH SIDE (THE US AND PRC) SHOULD
ACT IN ITS OWN WAY. WE CANNOT MAKE SUGGESTIONS ON
HOW THE US SHOULD BUILD ITS FORCES, AND VICE VERSA.
WE HAVE DIFFERENT SOCIAL SYSTEMS. ONE POINT IN
COMMON IS THAT WE MUST DEAL WITH THE SOVIET UNION.

8. REP. STRATTON SAID THE CODEL HAD THE IMPRESSION FROM EARLIER
CONGRESSIONAL GROUPS THAT THE PRC FELT THE US SHOULD REMAIN IN
THE PACIFIC AND NOT WITHDRAW ITS FORCES BECAUSE OF DETENTE. IF
THE US REMAINED STRONG IN THE PACIFIC THIS WOULD REDUCE THE
LIKELIHOOD OF WAR. TO SAY THAT THE PRC DIDN'T CARE WHAT THE US
DID SUGGESTED THE PRC'S POSITION HAD CHANGED; THAT IT WOULD MAKE
NO DIFFERENCE IF THE US WITHDREW FROM KOREA AND GUAM BACK
TO PEARL HARBOR. WAS THIS REALLY THE PRC POSITION?
TANG WEN-SHENG INTERJECTED THAT THE QUESTION WAS ESPECIALLY
ON WHETHER PRC POLICY HAD CHANGED. CHANG:
WE HAVE STATED OUR POSITION OFTEN ON THIS QUESTION
AND OUR VIEWS HAVE NOT CHANGED. AS FOR KOREA,
WE HAVE ALSO STATED OUR POSITION. SINCE THE KOREAN
PEOPLE DON'T APPROVE OF YOUR PRESENCE, HOW CAN WE
SAY WE APPROVE. AS I'VE SAID, IN THE PACIFIC THE
SPEARHEAD OF THE SOVIETS IS DIRECTED AT THE U.S. AND THE
US OUGHT TO FIND A WAY TO DEAL WITH IT. YOUR PRESENCE
IN THE PACIFIC IS A FACT AND THE SOVIETS ARE TRYING TO
SQUEEZE YOU OUT. WE ALSO FAVOR FRIENDLY US-JAPAN
RELATIONS. WE DON'T SAY THIS QUESTION IS OF NO CONCERN
TO US. THAT'S NOT WHAT I MEAN.
STRATTON, FOLLOWING UP, PRESSED FOR BETTER MUTUAL UNDERSTANDING OF
MILITARY POLICIES, ON THE BASIS OF WHICH POSITIONS COULD BE
ESTABLISHED IN THE PACIFIC THAT WOULD DETER THE SOVIETS. HE

REMARKED THAT IF THE US WITHDREW FROM KOREA AND JAPAN THIS
WOULD BE AN INVITATION FOR THE SOVIETS TO MOVE IN. CHANG:
I THINK WE SHOULDN'T ARGUE THE POINT. IN KOREA
THE PEOPLE WILL SETTLE THE QUESTION. WE DON'T BELIEVE
IN A VACUUM THERE. (NOTE: CHANG APPARENTLY
MEANT CHINESE DO NOT BELIEVE US WITHDRAWAL FROM
KOREA WOULD CREATE A VACUUM THERE.)
REP. DICKINSON, NOTED PRESSURES ON CONGRESS AND HOUSE ARMED
SERVICES COMMITTEE FOR PAST SEVERAL YEARS TO WITHDRAW TROOPDUFROM
EUROPE AND PACIFIC AND ESPECIALLY KOREA. HE ASKED WHAT
CHINESE REACTION WOULD BE IF US FORCES WERE WITHDRAWAN FROM
KOREA. TANG &quot;CLARIFIED&quot; THE QUESTION. CHANG:
AT PRESENT YOU ARE NOT PREPARING TO WITHDRAW RROOPS.
IF YOU WITHDRAW THEM, THE KOREAN PEOPLE WILL BE
PLEASED. WE CANNOT ADVISE YOU ON EVERY QUESTION OF
WHERE YOU SHOULD AND SHOULDN'T WITHDRAW, BUT ON THE
WHOLE THE US HAS SCATTERED ITS STRENGTH THROUGHOUT
THE WORLD. THE QUESTION IS, WHERE IS THE FOCUS. IN A
WAR, IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHERE THE FOCUS IS, HOW CAN
YOU FIGHT? SHOULD THE US CLOSE TEN FINGERS TO FORM
A FIST OR SHOULD IT TRY TO HOLD DOWN TEN FLEAS WITH TEN
FINGERS?
REP. WILSON COMMENTED THAT THE FOCUS OF THE US WAS
ON SOVIET INTENTIONS. CITING THE EXTRA FUNDS VOTED BY CONGRESS
FOR SHIPS INCLUDING THE TRIDENT SUBMARINE, HE NOTED THAT IF
THE SOVIETS GAINED NAVAL SUPREMACY THEY COULD INTERDICT THE
MOVEMENT OF OIL TO JAPAN THOUGH MALACCA STRAITS. CHANG
ASKED IF THE US OR THE USSR WERE STRONGER IN NAVAL
FORCES. REP. PRICE SAID THE US WAS STRONGER; REP. WILSON
ADDED &quot;AT PRESENT.&quot; REP. PRICE SAID WE WERE TAKING STEPS, E.G.
THE NAVAL BUDGET INCREASES, TO SEE THAT THIS CONTINUED
TO BE THE CASE. CHANG ASKED WHICH SIDE WOULD BE STRONGER.
THE USSR OR THE US AND ITS ALLIES, IF THERE WERE A
CONVENTIONAL WAR IN EUROPE. REP. PRICE SAID IT WAS A QUESTION OF
POTENTIAL FORCES, NOT THOSE NOW IN BEING. HISTORY HAD SHOWN
THE US COULD BUILD UP ITS FORCES QUICKLY WHEN FIGHTING STARTED.
WE HAD ENTERED BOTH WORLD WARS WITH NO FORCES TO SPEAK OF.
SINCE WORLD WAR II WE HAD MAINTAINED HIGHER FORCES THAN USUAL
GECAUSE OF THYSSOVIET THREAT. THE US COULD EXPAND ITS FORCES
QUICKLY BUT INTHE MEANTIME MUST KEEP UP ITS R &amp; D EFFORTS.
WHEN CHANG COMMENTED THAT THE SOVIETS HAD &quot;CONSIDERABLY

LARGE&quot; FORCES INEASTERN EUROPE, PRICE AGREED, ADDING THAT IS
WHERE ONE WOULD EXPECT TO FIND THEM. US FORCES WERE IN
EUROPE AS PART OF THE NATO ARRANGEMENTS, BUT WE WERE NOT
MAINTAINING LARGE FORCES THERE OR ANYWHERE ELSE EITHER.

9. REP. WOLFF THEN SAID WE COULD ASSUME THAT IF WAR AROSE IT
WOULD NOT BE SELECTIVE; THERE WAS NO CONTROLLING WHERE THE DOGS
OF WAR WOULD BITE ONCE THEY WERE UNLEASHED. WORLD
WAR II HAD STARTED AS A CONVENTIONAL WAR BUT ENDED WITH USE OF

NUCLEAR WEAPONS. ONE COULD ASSUME IHAT THERE WOULD BE NO
US-SOVIET WAR THAT WOULD NOT ESCALATE TO NUCLEAR WAR.
RECALLING THAT FOREIGN MINISTER CHIAO HAD SAID WAR WAS
INEVITABLE, REP. WOLFF SAID THAT INSTEAD OF ENGAGING IN
POLEMICS OVER WHERE THE WAR WOULD START, WE SHOULD TRY TO FIND
MEANS OF POSTPONING IT, BECAUSE IF WAR CAME IT WOULD BE A
DISASTER FOR THE WHOLE WORLD. NEITHER CHINA NOR THE US
COULD STAY OUT. THOUGH HE WAS OPPOSED TO NUCLEAR WAR AND HAD
BEEN A DOVE ON VIETNAM, WOLFF SAID, THE US WOULD NOT BE
DEFEATED BY THE USSR AND WOULD RESORT TO ANY MEANS TO
ACHIEVE VICTORY. TANG EXPLAINED THE MEANING OF &quot;DOVE.&quot; CHANG:
WHEN WAR BREAKS OUT, IT WILL DEVELOP ACCORDING TO ITS
OWN LAW. THERE IS ALSO A LAW OF DEVELOPMENT AS TO WHERE
THE DOGS WILL BITE. IT IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE DOGS TO BITE
IN EVERY CORNER OF THE GLOBE. I THINK IT WILL BITE IN
EUROPE. THE OVERALL SITUATION IS TENSE, IN EUROPE
AND ELSEWHERE.
CHANG ARGUED THAT APOLICY OF ACCOMMODATING, APPEASING THE SOVIETS
WOULD ONLY ACCELERATE THE OUTBREAK OF WAR. HE WENT ON:
FROM OUR EXPERIENCE WITH THEM, WE SEE THAT THE SOVIETS
BULLY THE SOFT AND FEAR THE TOUGH. WE HAVE SAID THAT
CHINA IS A PIECE OF MEAT THAT THE SOVIETS WANT TO BITE.
BUT THE BONES IN THE MEAT ARE TOO TOUGH.

THEY
WILL BREAK OFF THE SOVIETS' TEETH. THIS IS OUR VIEW.

10. REP. WHITEHURST ASKED WHAT AREAS CHINA CONCENTRATED ON
TO MAKE THE SOVIETS UNWILLING TO ATTACK. WOULD CHINA INCREASE
ITS MILITARY BUDGET AS THE US WAS DOING? MENTIONING THE
CODEL'S VISIT TO AN INFANTRY DIVISION (SEPTEL),
HE ASKED WHAT OTHER AREAS THE PRC WAS CONENTRATING ON--
DID THEY ENVISAGE A GUERILLA WAR TO DEAL WITH THE SOVIET THREAT,
OR MORE SOPHISTICATED WEAPONS? CHANG:
OUR POLICY IS VERY SIMPLE: IT IS PEOPLE'S WAR. THIS
INCLUDES CONVENTIONAL WAR AND GUERILLA WARFARE. YET
YOU SAW OUR DIVISION; OBVIOUSLY IT WILL FIGHT A REGULAR
WAR. BUT OUR LARGEST FORCE IS OUR MILITIA. TO
A CONSIDEIIBLE EXTENT, THOSE WITH THE GREATEST
EXPERIENCE OF WAR ARE AT LOCAL LEVELS. IF WE CALL FOR
MOBILIZATION, WE CAN MOBILIZE TENS OF MILLIONS OF
TROOPS IN A SHORT TIME. AND HAVE MANY CADRES WITH
EXPERIENCEIN WAR. HOW WE FIGHT WILL DEPEND ON HOW
THE WAR ARISES. IT'S NO SECRET WE CONCENTRATE OUR
FORCES AGAINST THE NORTH.
REP. WHITEHURST AGAIN ASKED IF THE PRC MILITARY BUDGET,
LIKE THE US WAS INCREASING. CHANG:
OUR BUDGET LIKE YOURS IS DIFFICULT TO ESTIIMATE.
IT IS HARD TO TELL WHAT IS MILITARY AND WHAT ISN'T
THE CONCEPTS OF OUR TWO COUNTRIES DIFFER. WE ARE
BUILDING MANY AIRRAID SHELTERS WHICH ARE NOT IN
THE BUDGET. OUR MILITIA EXERCISE DAILY; THIS IS
NOT IN THE BUDGET. OUR MILITARY INDUSTRY ALSO
MANUFACTURES CIVILIAN PRODUCTS, AND CIVILIAN INDUSTRIES
CAN MAKE GUNS. ORDINARY FACTORIES ARE ABLE TO MAKE
RIFLES AND ANTI-AIRCRAFT ARTILLERY.
MANY MILITIA CAN REPAIR THEIR OWN WEAPONS AND
COMMUNES CAN MAKE MINES AND GUNPOWDER. ALL
THIS IS NOT IN THE BUDGET. OUR BUDGET FLUCTUATES
LITTLE, AND EVEN IF IT INCREASES THE AMOUNT WON'T BE
MUCH. BUT IF YOU INCLUDE AIRRAID SHELTERS AND MILITIA
IT IS A BIG INCREASE. IN THE US THERE IS DEBATE IN
CONGRESS OVER INCREASING THE BUDGET. THAT DOESN'T
HAPPEN IN CHINA. YOU HAVE TO VOTE. WE DON'T.

11. REP. ICHORD OBSERVED
THAT IT WAS HARD FOR OUR TWO COUNTRIES TO
UNDERSTAND EACH OTHER'S POLITICAL PROCESS. TENG HSIAO-PING
BEING NO LONGER PLA CHIEF OF GENERAL STAFF, HAD THE POSITION
BEEN FILLED, AND BY WHOM? CHANG:
OUR MILITARY AS FOUNDED BY CHAIRMANOMAO IS ALWAYS
UNDER PARTY LEADERSHIP. OUR CENTRAL COMMITTEE'S
MILITARY COMMISSION IS IN CHATHR OF THE ARMED
FORCES; ITS CHAIRMAN IS CHAIRMAN MAO. I CAN SAY
THAT TENG IS NO LONGER CHIEF OF GENERAL STAFF BUT
THERE HAS BEEN NO NEW APPOINTMENT. IT DOESN'T
MATTER WHETHER WE HAVE A CHIEF OF GENERAL STAFF. IN OUR COUNTRY WEDIDN'T
HAVE ONE FOR SEVERAL
YEARS. I CAN SAY THAT WHEN TENG WAS CHIEF OF
GENERAL STAFF HE DID LITTLE IN THAT CAPACITY, BUT
PLEASE DON'T LET THIS GET OUT.

12. RESPONDING TO AN APPROVING
COMMENT BY REP. WILSON ON THE PRC'S TUNNEL PROGRAM, AND
REP. WILSON'S SUGGESTION THAT CHINA EXPECTED SOME NUCLEAR
WARFARE WITH THE RUSSIANS, CHANG SAID:
WHEN WE DIG TUNNELS, WE AIM NOT ONLY AT PREVENTING
AIR RAIDS. WE ASSUME EVERY CITY MUST FIGHT THE WAR.
WHEN THE SOVIETS COME, EVERY CITY MUST FIGHT. THE
TUNNELS
ARE PART OF OUR PREPAREDNESS FOR FIGHTING.
DURING THE JAPANESE OCCUPATION MANY VILLAGES HAD
UNDERGROUND TUNNELS. THE JAPANESE HAD THEIR
FORH ESSES #
ABOVE, BUT THEY COULDN'T ESTABLISH
CONTROL. AS FOR NUCLEAR WEAPONS, OF COURSE WE CARRY
ON RESEARCH, MAINLY BECAUSE IF WE DON'T SOME PEOPLE
WILL TRY TO OULVQ#AND INTIMIDATE US. NOW WE CAN SAY
YOU HAVE THEM(NUCLEAR WEAPONS) AND WE HAVE THEM.
BUT WE HAVE ONLY A FEW, AND EVEN IN THE FUTURE WE
WON'T HAVE AS MANY AS YOU. YOU AND THE SOVIETS
HAVE A GREAT MANY, MORE THAN CHINA HAS. BUT IF
THERE ARE TOO MANY, THERE IS NOT MUCH USE FOR THEM.

THE CODEL'S PLEASURE AT BEING THE FIRST TO SEE AN INFANTRY UNIT.
THE CODEL WOULD BE GOING TO DARIEN TO SEE A NAVAL UNIT.
(SOMEONE ON THE CHINESE SIDE INTERJECTED: &quot;TOTEE THE HARBOR.&quot;)
REP. WILSON CONCLUDED BY EXPRESSING THE HOPE THAT NOTHING
WOULD AFFECT THIS DOOR OPENED TO FRIENDSHIP AND EXHCHANGES. CHANG:

IN TIEN AN MEN SQUARE AND GREAT TURMOIL IN CHINA. I

IN OUR GOVERNMENT, THERE IS SPECULATION THAT THESE
WILL BRING PROBLEMS AND CHANGES IN POLICY. IMPACT
AND CHANGE IN PREMIER CAME ABOUT BECAUSE PREMIER
CHOU DIED, AND NOT BECAUSE OF ANY GREAT INTERNAL
PROBLEMS. THE CHANGES IN THE GOVERNMENTAL LEADER-
SHIP AND STAFF MEMBERS ARE NOT DIRECTLY CONNECTED
WITH POLICY. IN OUR COUNTRY THE LINE AND POLICY ARE
FORMULATED BY CHAIRMAN MAO. CHAIRMAN
MAO FORMULATED OUR LINE AND POLICY ON MARXIST-
LENINIST PRINCIPLES AND PRACTICAL ANALYSIS OF THE WORLD
SITUATION. I WILL GIVE YOU EXAMPLES TO SHOW THAT CHANGES
IN PERSONNEL WON'T MEAN CHANGES IN POLICY. TAKE SINO-
SOVIET RELATIONS. WHEN WE HAD FRIENDLY RELATIONS,
CHOU EN-LAI WAS PREMIER. WHEN CHINA AND THE USSR
HAD A FALLING OUT, CHOU EN-LAI REMAINED PREMIER. THE
SAME PERSON WAS PREMIER BUT THE POLICY CHANGED. IT
CHANGED BECAUSE THE SITUATION CHANGED, BOTH THE ONE IN
CHINA. AND IN THE SOVIET UNION, BREZHNEV REPLACED
KHRUSCHEV, BUT THE LINE AND POLICY WERE NOT CHANGED.
SO,IN THIS QUESTION LOOK AT THE LINE AND POLICY OF A
COUNTRY, NOT AT CHANGES IN PERSONNEL, I READ THAT
BREZHNEV IS IN POOR HEALTH AND WILL BE REPLACED AND
THEN THERE WILL BE A CHANGE IN SOVIET POLICY. I THINK
THEIR POLICY WON'T CHANGE. US-PRC RELATIONS

CHANGED WHILE CHOU WAS THE PREMIER, BECAUSE THE
SITUATION CHANGED. I'VE EXPLAINED THIS POINT.

14. REP. RANDALL, AFTER TOUCHING ON VARIOUS POINTS COVERED
EARLIER IN THE CONVERSATION, ASKED IF IT WAS TRUE THAT THE PRC
WAS BUYING SOME ARMAMENT MATERIALS FROM ABROAD. CHANG:
OUR POLICY, AS YOU UNDERSTAND WELL, IS SELF-RELIANCE
AND INDEPENDENCE. AS FOR MILITARY MATERIALS, WE
BUY SOME AND WE SELL SOME. WE SELL SOME MILITARY
MATERIALS AND WE BUY SOME. IT IS HARD TO DEFINE
WHICH ARE MILITARY MATERIALS AND WHICH ARE NOT. SOME
SAY THIS OR THAT IS OF A MILITARY NATURE AND WE MAY NOT
CONSIDER IT SO. OTHERS THINK SOME THINGS ARE NOT OF
A STRATEGIC FUTURE AND WE THINK THEY ARE. GRAIN IS
AN IMPORTANT STRATEGIC MATERIAL. IF SOLDIERS CAN'T EAT,
THEY CAN'T FIGHT. IT IS TRUE THAT WE BUY SOME MILITARY
MATERIALS BUT WE MAINLY RELY ON OURSELVES. FROM
OUR EXPERIENCE OF TWO DECADES, WE RELY ON OUR OWN
EFFORTS TO BUILD OUR MILITARY INDUSTRY, NUCLEAR INCLUDED.
IF THERE IS A BLOCKADE AND PEOPLE REFUSE TO SELL US
WEAPONS, WE ARE PLEASED BECAUSE WE'LL RELY ON OUR-
SELVES AND WHEN WE RELY ON OURSELVES WE CAN
ACCOMPLISH THESE TASKS. &quot;NOTHING IS HARD IF YOU
DARE TO SCALE THE HEIGHTS,&quot; AND THE CHINESE PEOPLE
ARE DOING THIS.

15. REP. PRICE EXPRESSED THANKS ON BEHALF OF ALL. CHANG
SAID HE TOO HAD APPRECIATED THE CANDID EXCHANGE OF VIEWS,
WHICH WOULD PROMOTE MUTUAL UNDERSTANDING. BUT BECAUSE THE
DISCUSSION HAD BEEN SO FRANK, HE REQUESTED THAT IT NOT BE
PUBLISHED. REP. PRICE ASSURED HIM THE DISCUSSION WOULD NOT
BE PUT ON THE RECORD. CHANG ADDED:
IF YOU DON'T PUBLISH AND IF YOU COME AGAIN WE
CAN HAVE A FREE EXCHANGE. IF YOU PUBLISH, WE WILL
REFRAIN FROM TALKING (FRANKLY) NEXT TIME.

16. ATMOSPHERICS. NCNA'S REPORT OF THE MEETING DESCRIBED
IT AS A &quot;FRIENDLY TALK&quot; AND THE SHORT FILM CLIP SHOWN IN PEKING
TELEVISION SHOWED A SMILING CHANG ENERGETICALLY SHAKING HANDS
WITH EACH MEMBER OF THE AMERICAN PARTY AND THEN
EXCHANGING INITIAL PLEASANTRIES WITH REP. PRICE. BUT CHANG,

THOUGH TAKING THE SAME SUBSTANTIVE LINE WITH THE CODEL AS CHIAO
HAD EARLIER, CAME ACROSS TO THE CODEL AS MUCH LESS DIPLOMATIC,
REPS. PRICE AND WOLFF BOTH COMMENTED TO US THAT THEY FELT
AT TIMES CHANG WAS NEEDLING THE CODEL. ASIDE FROM THE CONTENTS
OF HIS REMARKS, WHICH SEEMED AT TIMES UNNECESSARILY
DIDACTIC OR GRATUITOUSLY NEGATIVE, A COUPLE OF CHANG'S PERSONAL
MANNERISMS DID NOT GO OVER WELL. HE GIGGLED FREQUENTLY, AND
GAVE THE IMPRESSION OF LOOKING AT, AND PLAYING TO, THE OTHER
CHINESE PRESENT MORE THAN TO HIS INTERLOCUTORS.
