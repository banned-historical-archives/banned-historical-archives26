		<h3>Tor</h3>
		<p><a href="https://www.torproject.org">Tor</a> is an encrypted anonymising network that makes it harder to intercept internet communications, or see where communications are coming from or going to.</p>
		<p>In order to use the WikiLeaks public submission system as detailed above you can download the Tor Browser Bundle, which is a Firefox-like browser available for Windows, Mac OS X and GNU/Linux and pre-configured to connect using the anonymising system Tor.</p>
		<h4>Tails</h4>
		<p>If you are at high risk and you have the capacity to do so, you can also access the submission system through a secure operating system called <a href="https://tails.boum.org">Tails</a>. Tails is an operating system launched from a USB stick or a DVD that aim to leaves no traces when the computer is shut down after use and automatically routes your internet traffic through Tor. Tails will require you to have either a USB stick or a DVD at least 4GB big and a laptop or desktop computer.</p>

		<h3>Tips</h3>
		<p>Our submission system works hard to preserve your anonymity, but we recommend you also take some of your own precautions. Please review these basic guidelines. </p>
		<div>
			<h4>1. Contact us if you have specific problems</h4>
			<p>If you have a very large submission, or a submission with a complex format, or are a high-risk source, please <a href="#submit_help_contact">contact us</a>. In our experience it is always possible to find a custom solution for even the most seemingly difficult situations.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h4>2. What computer to use</h4>
			<p>If the computer you are uploading from could subsequently be audited in an investigation, consider using a computer that is not easily tied to you. Technical users can also use <a href="https://tails.boum.org">Tails</a> to help ensure you do not leave any records of your submission on the computer.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h4>3. Do not talk about your submission to others</h4>
			<p>If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in source protection – it is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This includes other media organisations.</p>
		</div>

	</div>
</div>

<div id="submit_help_after" class="submit_elem">

			</div>
		</div>

		<h3>After</h3>

		<div>
			<h4>1. Do not talk about your submission to others</h4>
			<p>If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in source protection – it is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This includes other media organisations.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h4>2. Act normal</h4>
			<p>If you are a high-risk source, avoid saying anything or doing anything after submitting which might promote suspicion. In particular, you should try to stick to your normal routine and behaviour.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h4>3. Remove traces of your submission</h4>
			<p>If you are a high-risk source and the computer you prepared your submission on, or uploaded it from, could subsequently be audited in an investigation, we recommend that you format and dispose of the computer hard drive and any other storage media you used.</p>
			<p>In particular, hard drives retain data after formatting which may be visible to a digital forensics team and flash media (USB sticks, memory cards and SSD drives) retain data even after a secure erasure. If you used flash media to store sensitive data, it is important to destroy the media.</p>
			<p>If you do this and are a high-risk source you should make sure there are no traces of the clean-up, since such traces themselves may draw suspicion.</p>
			<div>
				<h4>4. If you face legal action</h4>
				<p>If a legal action is brought against you as a result of your submission, there are organisations that may help you. The Courage Foundation is an international organisation dedicated to the protection of journalistic sources. You can find more details at <a href="https://www.couragefound.org">https://www.couragefound.org</a>.</p>

		<p>WikiLeaks publishes documents of political or historical importance that are censored or otherwise suppressed. We specialise in strategic global publishing and large archives.</p>
		<p>The following is the address of our secure site where you can anonymously upload your documents to WikiLeaks editors. You can only access this submissions system through Tor. (See our <a href="#submit_help_tor">Tor tab</a> for more information.) We also advise you to read our <a href="#submit_help_tips">tips for sources</a> before submitting.</p>

<br />
<br />
   Matt - <br />
   thanks much for this -- the spelling on place names is helpful (much<br />
   faster when you do it ) -- and obviously I have a few weird typos of my<br />
   own in there (Xiang Jemin! hahaha) I did this transcript super-fast. Good<br />
   catch on the French/Vietnamese Indochina thing -- I can work around that<br />
   with the audio we have, as long as vocal inflections don't sound strange<br />
   on the recording. <br />
   From what I can tell right now, it'll probably separate out into three<br />
   pieces -- one on basic ethnic topography and the Han core, one on Qing and<br />
   communist prerogatives, and one on the ethnic policy challenges sharpening<br />
   in present and future. But that's a rough guide and I'll piece it together<br />
   - will be in touch with you at your gmail address as it comes together.<br />
   Many thanks, again, for taking part in this and so many other things. Good<br />
   luck with the next phase and please stay in touch! You'll be missed!<br />

   Hey Marla,<br />
<br />
   My comments are in bold below. Some of them you will probably ignore, like<br />
   the spelling of Qing dynasty or Jiang Zemin, because they are only there<br />
   in case you produce a typed transcript for the final version (they won't<br />
   affect audio).<br />
<br />
   In general I am greatly relieved. I thought I did much *worse* than this.<br />
   Still not perfect but I think we have a fairly good presentation here. I<br />
   think you chose a great topic and I hope I've done justice to it.<br />
   Let me know if you need anything else, and if possible please do send me<br />
   an audio version to my permanent address when it is finished, I'd really<br />
   like to hear how it turned out ... if only for my ongoing media training!<br />
<br />
   Thanks again so much for including me in this project.<br />
   All best,<br />

<br />
   To understand China we have to begin with the Han people because the Han<br />
   people are basically the core of China, in the north China plain a** where<br />
   they have always lived, basically in the basin of the Yellow river all the<br />
   way down to the basin of the Yangtze River and the two deltas of those<br />
   rivers and all of the agricultural land in between. Thata**s the home of<br />
   Han people. Thata**s the vast majority of China, even today thata**s 1.2<br />
   billion out of the 1.3 billion population of the country. While China is a<br />
   country of many minorities, 56 minorities crap, it is actually 56 ethnic<br />
   groups ... 55 minorities ... [i'm sure i said this at some other point on<br />
   audio], that  a*| one majority population of the Han, thata**s where we<br />
   begin. This is a people who were constantly defending against what they<br />
   considered to be barbarians surrounding them. Coming from the northeastern<br />
   plain, which has also been known as Manchuria in the past, Inner Mongolia,<br />
   the northwest, the Tarim Basin and the Turkman Turfan depression, which is<br />
   modern-day Xinjiang Region, and the Tibetan Plateau. Early in the Han<br />
   peoplea**s history, they were under attack from nomads and tribes from<br />
   these areas that would sweep down upon the plains and try to acquire the<br />
   wealth that the Han people had built up in their very prosperous<br />
   civilization. The Great Wall of course is the great symbol attesting to<br />
   the Han peoplea**s defenses and their fortifications expanding their realm<br />
   outward.<br />
<br />
    <br />
<br />
   What that means is that in the modern-world a** well, we can get to that<br />
   in a minute.<br />
<br />
    <br />
<br />
   Stand-alone statement for setup?<br />
<br />
    <br />
<br />
   China is a country of 56 a*|ethnicities?<br />
<br />
    <br />
<br />
   2:29-3:07 (phone line difficult)<br />
<br />
   China is a country of 56 ethnicities, the 56 being the Han majority and<br />
   the rest being minority groups YES this is correct, use this. The country<br />
   has taken shape over centuries and really millennia with a Han majority<br />
   based in the north China plain that has expanded outward to conquer buffer<br />
   regions that it uses to defend itself and defend its interests, and these<br />
   buffer regions all contain numerous peoples who have had different<br />
   cultural and economic backgrounds, and who often stand at variance with<br />
   the Han majority.<br />
<br />
    <br />
<br />
    <br />
<br />
   Try again? Due to phone line choppy (is calling from landline)<br />
<br />
    <br />
<br />
   4:16-4:59<br />
<br />
   So China is a country of 56 ethnicities. The Han majority, which is based<br />
   in the North China Plain, is the core of Chinese civilization, and its<br />
   rivalry and experience with the buffer region surrounding it and the<br />
   peoples of those regions has defined Chinaa**s history writ large. What<br />
   that means is that, as China has moved outward and encountered new areas,<br />
   it has encountered people with different economic backgrounds and<br />
   different culture, and the stability of relations between Beijing and<br />
   these people has, well a*| the stability of relations between the Han<br />
   majority and these people has , has proved critical at different points in<br />
   time.<br />
<br />
   Geographic features that shaped and separated the people groups? Very<br />
   briefly explain where the different groups were a** and any particular<br />
   geographic features that separated them.<br />
<br />
    <br />
<br />
   6:46-7:59<br />
<br />
   Historically the most prominent groups have been the Manchurians in the<br />
   northeastern plain; the Mongols who have been in obviously Mongolia, but<br />
   also Inner Mongolia which is in modern-day China; in the northwest, in<br />
   modern-day Xinjiang region, where you have both the Tiansieng Tien Shan<br />
   mountains and large basins, like the Tarim Basin, you had the Uighur<br />
   peope, who are a Turkic ethnicity; and then in the Tibetan Plateau of<br />
   course were the Tibetan nomads, who have a very long history and a history<br />
   of rivalry with the Chinese. The Yunnan plateau, which leads up to the<br />
   Tibetan Plateau is an area in southwest China thata**s very thickly<br />
   forested, ita**s a jungle area, it borders with the Southeast Asian states<br />
   like Burma, and this is an area where there are a number of hill people<br />
   and different tribes, and a lot of  permeations between the Chinese areas<br />
   and the areas of other countries that are the areas of these people<br />
   themselves.<br />
<br />
    <br />
<br />
   Next issue a** economically, how did this diversity become important in<br />
   Chinaa**s history (political and economic)? a** Mao and Communism<br />
<br />
    <br />
<br />
   9:15-9:25<br />
<br />
   So the Han people were based in the north China plain where obviously the<br />
   majority of their agricultural production was how their society was based,<br />
   and most of the a** rephrase<br />
<br />
    <br />
<br />
    <br />
<br />
   9:28-13:05<br />
<br />
   The Han people were agricultural -- most of their power base was centered<br />
   on growing grains in the north China plain, and what they were constantly<br />
   battling with was this idea of outsiders whose way of life depended on the<br />
   ability to roam around and therefore had better armies and were more<br />
   equipped to do combat. The civilization itself was capable of surviving by<br />
   assimilating waves of invaders and waves of attackers, even at the expense<br />
   of political control at different times.<br />
<br />
    <br />
<br />
   Other minorities made their money and their living in different ways.<br />
   Aside from the groups that were nomads and herders, you also had the<br />
   groups that were mountain people, that were based on the river culture,<br />
   and also of course the Silk Road, which leads through the Gansu corridor<br />
   up through Xinjiang and into Central Asia --  thata**s also a corridor<br />
   that brought in peoples from the Middle East and Central Asia and<br />
   basically created a lifestyle of merchant and economic trade. And of<br />
   course on the coast, the southerna** yeah, well, we can skip that. i<br />
   skipped the coast because it is mostly Han dominated ... but there are a<br />
   few exceptions of sub-groups of Han in the far south ... (this is why it<br />
   is so complicated talking about these issues)<br />
<br />
    <br />
<br />
   When Chairman Mao Zedong came to power and the Communist Party emerged,<br />
   the basic problem was the fact that the country had not been unified under<br />
   the Cheng Qing dynasty, it had been collapsing and crumbling apart at the<br />
   edges because of the intrusion of foreign influences. Those foreign<br />
   influences would take advantage of the ethnic and  cultural differences in<br />
   different areas. So you had the Russians and the British playing around in<br />
   the Tibetan areas, you had the Russians in Xinjiang, you had the<br />
   Vietnamese CRAP, is that what I said?? It should have been the FRENCH. can<br />
   we cut and paste the word &quot;French&quot; from somewhere else and put it here?<br />
   I've offered another editing possibility below in bold: who had settled<br />
   Indochina and they were pushing up their influence into the southern<br />
   mountains, and of course you had a whole bunch of colonial powers all up<br />
   and down the coast, [insert: &quot;who had settled Indochina and were pushing<br />
   up their influence into the southern mountains, and&quot;] which had given<br />
   trouble to the Cheng Dynasty. So what Mao had to do was unify the country<br />
   and eliminate this source of leverage for foreign opponents. And his basis<br />
   for that was creating a system where the ethnicities for the first time<br />
   would be brought into the fold and told that they are now equally Chinese<br />
   with the Han Chinese themselves. This was under the Peoplea**s Republic of<br />
   China, and the idea was that Communism was now the overriding ideology;<br />
   ethnic differences would be subjugated and pretty much annihilated, and<br />
   the new structure would be based entirely on the redistribution of wealth,<br />
   redistribution of property, and equalization of living conditions. The<br />
   minority groups initially had a lot to benefit from this. Mao was very<br />
   popular for his land reform, which benefited them in their anti-feudal<br />
   stance, which helped lift up the very poor and downtrodden in the ethnic<br />
   groups. So Mao began this process, of course it required him to conquer<br />
   and take back areas that the Cheng Dynasty had lost, including inner<br />
   Mongolia, Xinjiang and Tibet. [Qing dynasty ... just in case we publish a<br />
   transcript along with the audio...]<br />
<br />
   So and similarly he had to repress rebellions in those areas. But<br />
   ultimately the ethnic groups, with the Tibetans being a major exception,<br />
   tended to view Mao in a positive light because he had given them a bigger<br />
   stake in the system. [i think this section flows very well and, in the<br />
   event that I did say &quot;Vietnamese&quot; instead of &quot;French,&quot; my proposed<br />
   insertion above will solve the problem without eliminating the Indochina<br />
   point, which is an important point.]<br />
<br />
    <br />
<br />
    <br />
<br />
   Question for context a** what was the Cheng Dynasty, and what period of<br />
   time?<br />
<br />
    <br />
<br />
   13:20-14:17<br />
<br />
   The Cheng Dynasty was the dynasty immediately preceding the 1911<br />
   revolution which brought in a national, a representative government a*|<br />
<br />
    <br />
<br />
   Redo<br />
<br />
   13:33-14:17<br />
<br />
   The Cheng Dynasty was the last major dynasty in Chinaa**s history. It was<br />
   an imperial dynasty with an emperor at the head, and it was run by the<br />
   Manchurians, which of course is interesting in and of itself because they<br />
   were an ethnic minority group that had risen to power  in the middle 17th<br />
   century, and they basically continued to rule at the upper echelons all<br />
   the way into the 20th century. In 1911 there was a revolution and set up a<br />
   republic, but that really initiated a period of civil war, and it wasna**t<br />
   until 1949 that the Peoplea**s Republic emerged victorious with the<br />
   Communist Party in charge, and they had to then go about reconstructing<br />
   the empire that had been lost by the Cheng Dynasty under foreign pressure.<br />
<br />
    <br />
<br />
   Issue of Chinaa**s internal cohesion and stability in recent times?<br />
<br />
   (economic conditions?)<br />
<br />
    <br />
<br />
   14:44-<br />
<br />
   So after Chairman Mao fell from a*|<br />
<br />
    <br />
<br />
   14:50-17:55<br />
<br />
   So after Chairman Mao passed away and Deng Xiaoping rose to power, he<br />
   opened up the Chinese economy and initiated this period that wea**ve seen<br />
   over the last three decades of rapid economic growth. That involves a*|<br />
   private enterprise and allowing people to get rich, this is very much true<br />
   -- Deng said  famously and explicitly that some people would be allowed to<br />
   get rich before others. so companies began to exploit and undertake<br />
   activities in the far-flung regions of China that previously they had not<br />
   been able to do so at the same pace, because they didna**t have access to<br />
   credit and they didna**t have as much freedom to operate economically. Now<br />
   you had a huge influx of activity in these areas, and Deng really used a<br />
   method of promoting an elite group among each ethnic minority group. And<br />
   that elite group was one that benefited form the new system, that would<br />
   get rich by or receive political post based on its relations with the Han<br />
   majority. So this sort of collaboration between the ethnic elite and the<br />
   incoming Han people created a system where the ethnic elite was<br />
   responsible for making sure that things were stable within their area.<br />
   Meanwhile the Han could come in and take economic advantage of the area.<br />
   But of course this also led to the problem of ethnic groups being, many of<br />
   them being the poorest and most left behind from Chinaa**s economic boom.<br />
<br />
    <br />
<br />
   Thata**s why when we get into the late 1990s and the Xiang Jemin Jiang<br />
   Zemin administration and the Hu Jintao administration, both of those<br />
   administrations emphasized this Go West policy of bringing the far<br />
   western, southwestern and northwestern regions up to speed with the rest<br />
   of the Chinese economy and develop these areas in a way that was a little<br />
   more sustainable than in the past. <br />
<br />
    <br />
<br />
   Now both the Xiang and Hu administrations have met with limited success in<br />
   this drive, but what they have been able to do is generate more revenues<br />
   that can be channeled back into these areas, and theya**ve also seen huge<br />
   expansions of infrastructure which have increased connectivity and<br />
   mobility between these regions and the others, as well as communications.<br />
<br />
    <br />
<br />
   So this is an ongoing process, and ita**s one that has generated quite a<br />
   bit of controversy because of the phenomenon of Hanization, which is the<br />
   process where the Han people will come into the area, exploit it, and<br />
   create frictions with the native ethnic locals, who see them as<br />
   introducers intruders [hopefully i didn't say &quot;introducers&quot;!] and dona**t<br />
   see themselves as benefiting as much. this section about the Jiang and Hu<br />
   admins flows fairly well it seems<br />
<br />
    <br />
<br />
   --<br />
<br />
   As the 2012 leadership transition approaches a** how will it affect China<br />
   a** and how will the cultural diversity show up if at all?<br />
<br />
    <br />
<br />
   18:22-<br />
<br />
   One thing that wea**ve seen is that no matter how much the Communist Party<br />
   attempts to kind of grind over ethnic differences, theya**re constantly<br />
   reasserting themselves in new ways. While the initial period of the<br />
   peoplea*|<br />
<br />
    <br />
<br />
    <br />
<br />
   (connection difficulties)<br />
<br />
    <br />
<br />
    <br />
<br />
   19:30-22:31<br />
<br />
   With the 2012 leadership, one thinga**s for sure. The leaders that are<br />
   coming in, like the leaders before them, will have experience governing on<br />
   the provincial level, so some of them will have a sense of what it takes<br />
   to be able to lead and in particular be able to manage or suppress if<br />
   necessary any ethnic troubles. Hu Jintao of course was very famous for<br />
   putting down Tibetan troubles, and that helped him rise to power. A nd his<br />
   successor, who is a*| -- well, anyway.<br />
<br />
    <br />
<br />
   This is going to be an important tool for them because what we have seen<br />
   recently in China is a deterioration of ethnic relations. Wea**ve seen the<br />
   2008 Tibetan uprising, which were major uprisings in Lhasa; we saw the<br />
   2009 Urumqi riots in Xinjiang, which reverberated and led to a total<br />
   change of policy in how Beijing tries to handle Xinjiang,<br />
<br />
    <br />
<br />
   And then in 2011 we saw the Inner Mongolian riots when problems with Han<br />
   coal miners erupted with ethnic Mongolia herders. Simultaneously wea**ve<br />
   seen rising border troubles with Myanmar and also the potential for<br />
   problems to emerge on the border with Laos or Vietnam. <br />
<br />
   20:55-22:31<br />
<br />
   So what we see is that within the areas where ethnic groups are most<br />
   prominent, therea**s been some deterioration. Thata**s something that will<br />
   distract from Chinaa**s ability to focus on major economic goals, its<br />
   dealings with foreign states. It could even give openings for foreign<br />
   states to take advantage of china, either through the Tibetan issue, the<br />
   Uighur issue or other ways, and it complicates things that are unexpected,<br />
   such as --<br />
<br />
    <br />
<br />
   And it can complicate areas that are unexpected too, for instance,<br />
   Chinaa**s dealing with North Korea a** even though China is a major patron<br />
   of North Korea, it does not have complete control of North Korea and is<br />
   constantly afraid that if it pushes too hard on North Korea, the regime<br />
   would collapse and that Koreans could spill over into China, where<br />
   therea**s already 2 million ethnic Koreans living. That itself would<br />
   create a problem for Beijing. i think this point is very much worth<br />
   keeping in terms of (1) ethnic topic (2) challenges for 2012 leadership<br />
<br />
    <br />
<br />
   So managing ethnic policy is going to be a major challenge, and ita**s<br />
   going to be all the harder because as the 2012 leadership group comes to<br />
   power, theya**re going to face this a*| ? that wea**ve been seeing<br />
<br />
    <br />
<br />
   would connect  &quot;they're going to face this ...&quot; Within the Han majority<br />
   population as well, between the rich and the poor and the migrants and<br />
   locals. So theya**ll be struggling with that, theya**ll be struggling with<br />
   likely lower growth rates, which means theya**ll have fewer resources to<br />
   pacify ethnic problems, and theya**re going to be facing the potential for<br />
   foreign players to take advantage of ethnic issues.<br />
<br />
    <br />
<br />
    <br />
<br />
   Final question: has communism succeeded in at least suppressing natural<br />
   tensions between ethnic groups? What are the lessons youa**d draw from<br />
   this history?<br />
<br />
    <br />
<br />
   23:03-24:52<br />
<br />
   Well therea**s a great piece of old propaganda with Chairman Mao<br />
   surrounded by an exemplar of each of the different 55 ethnic groups, um<br />
   a*| let em start that again.<br />
<br />
    <br />
<br />

   Therea**s a great piece of propaganda, with Chairman Mao surrounded by one<br />
   representative of each of the other 55 ethnic groups, each wearing<br />
   traditional garb. The picture is very idyllic, it shows that all of these<br />
   groups are happy and theya**re proud of Chairman Mao and happy to be part<br />
   of the Peoplea**s Republic. That ideal certainly has not translated into<br />
   reality in the modern context. What wea**ve seen is that even though the<br />
   Peoplea**s republic did a much better job than prior Chinese governments<br />
   of creating a sense of unity, that sense of unity is now giving way to the<br />
   traditional geographic, economic and cultural divisions and strains. I<br />
   REALLY hope we can keep this example of the Maoist propaganda. <br />
<br />
   Those are sharpening because of the rapid pace of growth that eastern<br />
   china has experienced and the new capabilities that ita**s brought to the<br />
   ethnic regions, which then allowed them to reassert themselves, whether<br />
   that be through communications, their own economic relations with<br />
   neighbors, or their ties with an international group of organizations and <br />
   people who show interest.<br />
<br />
    <br />
<br />
   So for China, while the communist party has --<br />
<br />
    <br />
<br />
   So while the communist party has not struggled with the really intense<br />
   inter-ethnic rivalry that is seen throughout history, it is also<br />
   impossible to suggest that ita**s overcoming those differences, and in<br />
   fact what wea**ll see as we go forward is rising ethnic problems.<br />
