		<h3>Tor</h3>
		<p><a href="https://www.torproject.org">Tor</a> is an encrypted anonymising network that makes it harder to intercept internet communications, or see where communications are coming from or going to.</p>
		<p>In order to use the WikiLeaks public submission system as detailed above you can download the Tor Browser Bundle, which is a Firefox-like browser available for Windows, Mac OS X and GNU/Linux and pre-configured to connect using the anonymising system Tor.</p>
		<h4>Tails</h4>
		<p>If you are at high risk and you have the capacity to do so, you can also access the submission system through a secure operating system called <a href="https://tails.boum.org">Tails</a>. Tails is an operating system launched from a USB stick or a DVD that aim to leaves no traces when the computer is shut down after use and automatically routes your internet traffic through Tor. Tails will require you to have either a USB stick or a DVD at least 4GB big and a laptop or desktop computer.</p>

		<h3>Tips</h3>
		<p>Our submission system works hard to preserve your anonymity, but we recommend you also take some of your own precautions. Please review these basic guidelines. </p>
		<div>
			<h4>1. Contact us if you have specific problems</h4>
			<p>If you have a very large submission, or a submission with a complex format, or are a high-risk source, please <a href="#submit_help_contact">contact us</a>. In our experience it is always possible to find a custom solution for even the most seemingly difficult situations.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h4>2. What computer to use</h4>
			<p>If the computer you are uploading from could subsequently be audited in an investigation, consider using a computer that is not easily tied to you. Technical users can also use <a href="https://tails.boum.org">Tails</a> to help ensure you do not leave any records of your submission on the computer.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h4>3. Do not talk about your submission to others</h4>
			<p>If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in source protection – it is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This includes other media organisations.</p>
		</div>

	</div>

		<h3>After</h3>

		<div>
			<h4>1. Do not talk about your submission to others</h4>
			<p>If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in source protection – it is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This includes other media organisations.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h4>2. Act normal</h4>
			<p>If you are a high-risk source, avoid saying anything or doing anything after submitting which might promote suspicion. In particular, you should try to stick to your normal routine and behaviour.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h4>3. Remove traces of your submission</h4>
			<p>If you are a high-risk source and the computer you prepared your submission on, or uploaded it from, could subsequently be audited in an investigation, we recommend that you format and dispose of the computer hard drive and any other storage media you used.</p>
			<p>In particular, hard drives retain data after formatting which may be visible to a digital forensics team and flash media (USB sticks, memory cards and SSD drives) retain data even after a secure erasure. If you used flash media to store sensitive data, it is important to destroy the media.</p>
			<p>If you do this and are a high-risk source you should make sure there are no traces of the clean-up, since such traces themselves may draw suspicion.</p>
			<div>
				<h4>4. If you face legal action</h4>
				<p>If a legal action is brought against you as a result of your submission, there are organisations that may help you. The Courage Foundation is an international organisation dedicated to the protection of journalistic sources. You can find more details at <a href="https://www.couragefound.org">https://www.couragefound.org</a>.</p>

		<p>WikiLeaks publishes documents of political or historical importance that are censored or otherwise suppressed. We specialise in strategic global publishing and large archives.</p>
		<p>The following is the address of our secure site where you can anonymously upload your documents to WikiLeaks editors. You can only access this submissions system through Tor. (See our <a href="#submit_help_tor">Tor tab</a> for more information.) We also advise you to read our <a href="#submit_help_tips">tips for sources</a> before submitting.</p>

			<!--<div>
				Copy this address into your Tor browser. Advanced users, if they wish, can also add a further layer of encryption to their submission using <a href="#submit_wlkey">our public PGP key</a>.
			</div>-->
		</div>

		<p>If you cannot use Tor, or your submission is very large, or you have specific requirements, WikiLeaks provides several alternative methods. <a href="#submit_help_contact">Contact us</a> to discuss how to proceed.</p>

BUTTERFIELD SAYS NEW ATMOSPHERE ON HUMAN RIGHTS MAY
ALREADY BE HAVING SOME EFFECT, AS GROUP OF 25 DISSIDENTS
WHO WAITED OUTSIDE COURTHOUSE DURING WEI'S TRIAL DID
NOT SHOW UP 10/17, EVEN THOUGH THEY HAD EARLIER TAKEN

ORDINARY CHINESE COULD ALSO SUFFER BECAUSE OF STIFF
PENALTIES ATTACHED TO WEI'S FRIENDSHIPS WITH DIPLOS/

THAT NEARLY ALL 400 CHINESE SPECTATORS AT TRIAL REBUFFED

CAMPAIGN AGAINST DEMOCRATIC MOVEMENT. BELIEVES MANY IN

LITTLE LIKELIHOOD OF REVERSAL.

EUROPE, THOUGH HE HAD SAID BEFORE DEPARTURE THAT SUCH
DISSIDENT TRIALS PLANNED; BELIEVES CASE ALSO WILL ERODE
CREDIBILITY OF CHINA'S CLAIM IT IS MOVING TOWARD MORE
OPEN/DEMOCRATIC SYSTEM UNDER RULE OF LAW. PREDICTS PROSECUTION OF FU YUEHA/REN WANDING CASES WILL INEVITABLY

BEFORE APPEARANCE OF WEI'S WALL POSTER, SAYS BUTTERFIELD
(NYT BEIJING 10/17), THERE WAS SCANT EVIDENCE OF ORGANIZED
DISSIDENT MOVEMENT IN CHINA. BUT SINCE THEN IT HAS BECOME FAIRLY COMMON FOR YOUNG CHINESE IN CITIES TO ECHO HIS
SENTIMENTS ABOUT DEMOCRACY--BUT HOW WIDELY THESE VIEWS
SHARED IN PREDOMINANTLY RURAL POPULATION OF MORE THAN 900
MIL REMAINS MATTER FOR CONJECTURE. BUTTERFIELD NOTES
AUTHORITIES HAVE SEEMED SOMEWHAT AMBIVALENT ABOUT DEMAND
FOR FREER EXPRESSION--WEI WAS ARRESTED IN MARCH, BUT MANY
OF HIS ASSOCIATES HAVE CONTINUED AIR THEIR VIEWS OPENLY.
CONTENDS TIMING OF WEI'S TRIAL/SEVERITY OF HIS SENTENCE
CONFOUNDED DIPLOS/WEI'S FRIENDS. NOTES TRIAL CAME ONLY
DAY AFTER HUA'S ARRIVAL IN FRANCE, WHERE CHINA'A RECORD ON
HUMAN RIGHTS IS MUCH MORE IMPORTANT ISSUE THAN IN US,
AND TUES SENTENCING OF WEI COULD EMBARRASS HUA.
BUTTERFIELD POINTS OUT TRIAL ALSO COMES AT TIME WHEN
BEIJING HAD SEEMED TOLERATING FREER EXPRESSIONS OF
OPINION/HAD ALLOWED VARIETY OF DEMONSTRATIONS BY DISSIDENTS.
BUTTERFIELD REPORTS NONE OF WEI'S FAMILY/FRIENDS/FON
NEWSMEN WAS ABLE ENTER COURT BUILDING FOR TRIAL, ALTHOUGH

BUTTERFIELD (NYT BEIJING) NOTES FU YUEHUA TRIAL UNDERWAY.
SAYS SEEMED SHE HELD IN JAIL 2 AND HALF MONTHS WITHOUT
BEING FORMALLY ARRESTED, IN VIOLATION OF ARREST LAW
PUBLISHED IN FEB. SEES FU/WEI TRIALS DESIGNED SERVE AS
WARNING THAT MOVES TOWARD GREATER DEMOCRACY WILL NOT BE
PERMITTED GO BEYOND PRESCRIBED LIMIT. SAYS DENG'S INDICATING TO 7 VISITING US GOVS THAT DISSIDENTS DO NOT
REPRESENT &quot;GENUINE FEELING OF OUR PEOPLE&quot; APPEARS SHIFT
BY ONE THOUGHT OF AS CHAMPION OF MOVEMENT FOR LIBERALIZATION.
BUTTERFIELD SAYS NEW ATMOSPHERE ON HUMAN RIGHTS MAY
ALREADY BE HAVING SOME EFFECT, AS GROUP OF 25 DISSIDENTS
WHO WAITED OUTSIDE COURTHOUSE DURING WEI'S TRIAL DID
NOT SHOW UP 10/17, EVEN THOUGH THEY HAD EARLIER TAKEN
INTEREST IN FU'S CASE.

ORDINARY CHINESE COULD ALSO SUFFER BECAUSE OF STIFF
PENALTIES ATTACHED TO WEI'S FRIENDSHIPS WITH DIPLOS/
JOURNALISTS. SUGGEST ONE SIGN OF CHANGED ATMOSPHERE WAS
THAT NEARLY ALL 400 CHINESE SPECTATORS AT TRIAL REBUFFED
REPORTERS' EFFORTS QUESTION THEM ABOUT PROCEEDINGS/IN
SOME CASES PUSHED BICYCLES OVER JOURNALISTS' FEET.
COMMENTING ON WEI JINGSHENG'S SENTENCE, BSUN'S PARKS
(BEIJING 10/17) NOTES XINHUA REPORT OF TRIAL STRESSED
COUNTER-REVOLUTIONARY CHARGES MORE THAN HIS ALLEGED
DISCLOSURE OF MIL SECRETS--AND THIS IS CERTAINLY WHAT
AUTHORITIES WILL EMPHASIZE IN THEIR FOLLOW-UP PROPAGANDA
CAMPAIGN AGAINST DEMOCRATIC MOVEMENT. BELIEVES MANY IN
BEIJING HAD BEEN LED BY RECENT RELAXATION IN COUNTRY TO
BELIEVE WEI WOULD PROBABLY BE FREED/GIVEN MINIMUM SENTENCE. NOTES WEI HAS 10 DAYS TO APPEAL, THOUGH PROBABLY
LITTLE LIKELIHOOD OF REVERSAL.
PARKS SAYS CASE IS CERTAIN TO EM0ARRASS HUA GUOFENG IN
EUROPE, THOUGH HE HAD SAID BEFORE DEPARTURE THAT SUCH
DISSIDENT TRIALS PLANNED; BELIEVES CASE ALSO WILL ERODE
CREDIBILITY OF CHINA'S CLAIM IT IS MOVING TOWARD MORE
OPEN/DEMOCRATIC SYSTEM UNDER RULE OF LAW. PREDICTS PROSECUTION OF FU YUEHA/REN WANDING CASES WILL INEVITABLY
MEAN TIGHTER CONTROLS ON POL ACTIVITY JUST AS
DEMOCRACY MOVEMENT WAS RECOVERING ITS PREVIOUS VITALITY.

MIL SECRETS WILL FURTHER LIMIT CONTACTS BETWEEN CHINA/

BEFORE APPEARANCE OF WEI'S WALL POSTER, SAYS BUTTERFIELD
(NYT BEIJING 10/17), THERE WAS SCANT EVIDENCE OF ORGANIZED
DISSIDENT MOVEMENT IN CHINA. BUT SINCE THEN IT HAS BECOME FAIRLY COMMON FOR YOUNG CHINESE IN CITIES TO ECHO HIS
SENTIMENTS ABOUT DEMOCRACY--BUT HOW WIDELY THESE VIEWS
SHARED IN PREDOMINANTLY RURAL POPULATION OF MORE THAN 900
MIL REMAINS MATTER FOR CONJECTURE. BUTTERFIELD NOTES
AUTHORITIES HAVE SEEMED SOMEWHAT AMBIVALENT ABOUT DEMAND
FOR FREER EXPRESSION--WEI WAS ARRESTED IN MARCH, BUT MANY
OF HIS ASSOCIATES HAVE CONTINUED AIR THEIR VIEWS OPENLY.
CONTENDS TIMING OF WEI'S TRIAL/SEVERITY OF HIS SENTENCE
CONFOUNDED DIPLOS/WEI'S FRIENDS. NOTES TRIAL CAME ONLY
DAY AFTER HUA'S ARRIVAL IN FRANCE, WHERE CHINA'A RECORD ON
HUMAN RIGHTS IS MUCH MORE IMPORTANT ISSUE THAN IN US,
AND TUES SENTENCING OF WEI COULD EMBARRASS HUA.
BUTTERFIELD POINTS OUT TRIAL ALSO COMES AT TIME WHEN
BEIJING HAD SEEMED TOLERATING FREER EXPRESSIONS OF
OPINION/HAD ALLOWED VARIETY OF DEMONSTRATIONS BY DISSIDENTS.
BUTTERFIELD REPORTS NONE OF WEI'S FAMILY/FRIENDS/FON
NEWSMEN WAS ABLE ENTER COURT BUILDING FOR TRIAL, ALTHOUGH
NOTICE ON COURT WALL 10/15 HAD SAID SESSION WOULD BE
OPEN TO PUBLIC. OBSERVES TRIAL BORE SIGNS OF BEING
SHOWPIECE--WAS HELD IN CONFORTABLE/SPACIOUS THEATHER-LIKE

SHE RECEIVED TICKET FROM TAX OFFICE WHERE SHE WORKED,
HAD BEEN TOLD ATTEND TRIAL.

NEVER SO MANY SO EXPLICIT SO SOON ABOUT HOW FEW US LEADERS
WELL THOUGHT OF; EUROPEAN/JAPANESE BLUNT IN SAYING THEIR

THIS REGARD COULD CAUSE RUPTURE; BOTH PEKING/MOSCOW SENSE
ANTI-SOVIET PRESSURES BUILDING UP SO RAPIDLY IN US, THERE
NOW POTENTIAL FOR US PRO-CHINA TILT. GELB SAYS QUESTION
WHETHER OR NOT TO PROVIDE MIL HARDWARE/INTELL TO PEKING
&quot;VERY LIVE ISSUE&quot; WITHIN ADMIN. BUT THINKS THIS MIGHT BE
TOO MUCH TOO SOON FOR CHINA/ADMIN COULD WIND UP REPELLING
