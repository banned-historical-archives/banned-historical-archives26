		<h3>Tor</h3>
		<p><a href="https://www.torproject.org">Tor</a> is an encrypted anonymising network that makes it harder to intercept internet communications, or see where communications are coming from or going to.</p>
		<p>In order to use the WikiLeaks public submission system as detailed above you can download the Tor Browser Bundle, which is a Firefox-like browser available for Windows, Mac OS X and GNU/Linux and pre-configured to connect using the anonymising system Tor.</p>
		<h4>Tails</h4>
		<p>If you are at high risk and you have the capacity to do so, you can also access the submission system through a secure operating system called <a href="https://tails.boum.org">Tails</a>. Tails is an operating system launched from a USB stick or a DVD that aim to leaves no traces when the computer is shut down after use and automatically routes your internet traffic through Tor. Tails will require you to have either a USB stick or a DVD at least 4GB big and a laptop or desktop computer.</p>

		<h3>Tips</h3>
		<p>Our submission system works hard to preserve your anonymity, but we recommend you also take some of your own precautions. Please review these basic guidelines. </p>
		<div>
			<h4>1. Contact us if you have specific problems</h4>
			<p>If you have a very large submission, or a submission with a complex format, or are a high-risk source, please <a href="#submit_help_contact">contact us</a>. In our experience it is always possible to find a custom solution for even the most seemingly difficult situations.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h4>2. What computer to use</h4>
			<p>If the computer you are uploading from could subsequently be audited in an investigation, consider using a computer that is not easily tied to you. Technical users can also use <a href="https://tails.boum.org">Tails</a> to help ensure you do not leave any records of your submission on the computer.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h4>3. Do not talk about your submission to others</h4>
			<p>If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in source protection – it is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This includes other media organisations.</p>
		</div>

	</div>

		<h3>After</h3>

		<div>
			<h4>1. Do not talk about your submission to others</h4>
			<p>If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in source protection – it is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This includes other media organisations.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h4>2. Act normal</h4>
			<p>If you are a high-risk source, avoid saying anything or doing anything after submitting which might promote suspicion. In particular, you should try to stick to your normal routine and behaviour.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h4>3. Remove traces of your submission</h4>
			<p>If you are a high-risk source and the computer you prepared your submission on, or uploaded it from, could subsequently be audited in an investigation, we recommend that you format and dispose of the computer hard drive and any other storage media you used.</p>
			<p>In particular, hard drives retain data after formatting which may be visible to a digital forensics team and flash media (USB sticks, memory cards and SSD drives) retain data even after a secure erasure. If you used flash media to store sensitive data, it is important to destroy the media.</p>
			<p>If you do this and are a high-risk source you should make sure there are no traces of the clean-up, since such traces themselves may draw suspicion.</p>
			<div>
				<h4>4. If you face legal action</h4>
				<p>If a legal action is brought against you as a result of your submission, there are organisations that may help you. The Courage Foundation is an international organisation dedicated to the protection of journalistic sources. You can find more details at <a href="https://www.couragefound.org">https://www.couragefound.org</a>.</p>

		<p>WikiLeaks publishes documents of political or historical importance that are censored or otherwise suppressed. We specialise in strategic global publishing and large archives.</p>
		<p>The following is the address of our secure site where you can anonymously upload your documents to WikiLeaks editors. You can only access this submissions system through Tor. (See our <a href="#submit_help_tor">Tor tab</a> for more information.) We also advise you to read our <a href="#submit_help_tips">tips for sources</a> before submitting.</p>

			<!--<div>
				Copy this address into your Tor browser. Advanced users, if they wish, can also add a further layer of encryption to their submission using <a href="#submit_wlkey">our public PGP key</a>.
			</div>-->
		</div>

		<p>If you cannot use Tor, or your submission is very large, or you have specific requirements, WikiLeaks provides several alternative methods. <a href="#submit_help_contact">Contact us</a> to discuss how to proceed.</p>

1.  SHIPLER (NYT) FROM SAIGON SEES STRATEGY SHIFTS FORCED
ON GVN BY US AID CUTS.  TO SAVE FUEL AND AMMO, SOME
ISOLATED OUTPOSTS HAVE BEEN ABANDONED; &quot;HARRASSMENT
AND INTERDICTION&quot; ARTILLERY HAS VIRTUALLY ENDED; AND
SOME LARGE-UNIT OPERATIONS REPLACED BY SMALL, LONG-
UNCLASSIFIED

PAGE 02  STATE  193000

RANGE PATROLS.  ARMY OFFICERS, FOREIGN MIL MEN AND
GVN CIVILIANS DIFFER ON SIGNIFICANCE OF CHANGES.
SOME THINK THAT WITHDRAWAL FROM OUTPOSTS WILL CEDE LAND
TO COMMUNISTS AND PERHAPS FACILITATE FUTURE EFFORT TO
DRAW MAP DELINEATING AREAS OF CONTROL AS PRESCRIBED BY
C-F BUT RESISTED BY BOTH SIDES; OTHERS ARGUE THAT
OUTPOSTS ARE ONLY SYMBOLICALLY IMPORTANT AND SPREAD
FORCES TOO THINLY.  MIL MEN HAVE LONG DEBATED VALUE
OF H AND I FIRE AND SOME REGARD IT AS WASTE OF
AMMO AND THINK IT HURTS ;MOSTLY CIVILIANS, WHILE OTHERS
BELIEVE UNPREDICTABLE SHELLING HARASSES ENEMY AND
DAMAGES HIS MORALE.  SHIPLER FINDS WIDESPREAD AGREEMENT
THAT INCREASED LONG-RANGE PATROLS TARGETTED IN ENEMY
TERRITORY WILL WORK TO BENEFIT OF ARVN, NORMALLY
RESTRICTED TO DEFENSIVE POSTURE.

OUTPOST ABANDONMENT, MOST CONTROVERSIAL STRATEGY
CHANGE, EMERGED SIX-TO-NINE MONTHS AGO AS OCCASIONAL
&quot;EXCEPTIONS&quot; TO THIEU'S DIRECTIVE NOT TO GIVE AN INCH
TO THE COMMUNISTS.  EXCEPTIONS HAVE BECOME RULE AS
COMMUNISTS STEP UP ATTACKS AND CONGRESS CUTS AID.
INFORMED SOURCES SAY ABOUT 500 OF THE 3000 GVN OUTPOSTS
IN DELTA WILL BE &quot;CONSOLIDATED&quot; TO CONSERVE AMMO AND
FUEL.  ELSEWHERE, ABANDONMENT IS RELATED TO ENEMY
ATTACKS.  WESTERN DIPLOMAT SAYS THAT IN QUANG NAM AND
QUANG NGAI, COMMUNISTS ARE TAKING BACK WHAT THEY
CONSIDER TO BE THEIRS.  IN TAY NINH, WESTERN MIL
OFFICER SEES NVA ATTACKS RELATED TO OPENING NEW
LOGISTICAL CORRIDOR.  SHIPLER COMMENTS THAT USEFULNESS
OF SMALL OUTPOSTS HAS DECLINED AS RESULT OF DEVELOPMENT
OF MODERN LOGISTICS NETWORK BY NVA FOLLOWING END OF US
BOMBING; QUOTES FORMER USDAO GEN. MURRAY THAT HANOI
MUST HAVE A &quot;LOGISTICS GENIUS.&quot;  FOREIGN MIL OFFICER
NOTES THAT GVN ONCE USED TEN TIMES AS MUCH AMMO AS
COMMUNISTS; NOW RATIO HAS SHRUNK TO TWO-TO-ONE AND
COMMUNISTS &quot;GET COST EFFECTIVENESS OUT OF EVERY ROUND.&quot;
SHIPLER STATES THAT FEW BELIEVE STRATEGY CHANGES WILL
BREAK MIL STALEMATE SUDDENLY; QUOTES SVN OFFICER THAT
NEITHER SIDE HAS ENOUGH TROOPS TO OCCUPY THE WHOLE
COUNTRY.

2.  FIELD REPORTS SAY GVN TROOPS FIND ENTIRE VILLAGE
18 MILES SW OF DA NANG ABANDONED, WITH 2000 INHABITANTS
ABDUCTED BY COMMUNISTS (CHITRIB).

3.  SUN'S ISAACS IN SVN'S DELTA WRITES OF CONTINUOUS, LOW-
LEVEL, HIGH-CASUALTY WAR THAT HAS GONE ON THERE SINCE
C-F.  VC INFILTRATE VILLAGES, AND SURVIVAL BECOMES
OVERRIDING CONCERN OF INHABITANTS IN CONTESTED AREAS.
SOME FARMERS PAY VC TAXES, AND YOUTHS WHO BECOME ELIGIBLE
FOR THE GVN DRAFT SOMETIMES CROSS INTO VC TERRITORY
WHERE, AS FAR AS ANYONE KNOWS, THEY ARE NOT INDUCTED
BUT ARE ALLOWED TO FARM.  SOME DRAFT EVADERS TAKE
FAMILIES WITH THEM.  ISAACS SEES DELTA WAR AS HAVING
DECEPTIVE SURFACE SINCE IT IS FOUGHT AT CLOSE RANGE IN
MANY SMALL CLASHES AND LEAVES FEWER SCARS THAN MORE
CONVENTIONAL FIGHTING.  VILLAGES ARE USUALLY PROSPEROUS
WITH REGION'S RICH AGRICULTURAL ECONOMY; AND GVN TROOPS
ARE DISPERSED TO DEFEND POPULATION.  HALF OF GVN MILLION -
MAN FORCE IS IN DELTA, SCATTERED IN VILLAGES, AND CONSTANT
&quot;PIN-PRICK BATTLES&quot; ACCOUNT FOR OVER HALF OF GVN CASUALTIE
ISAACS OBSERVES THAT WAR IS FOUGHT FOR POPULATION MORE
THAN FOR LAND, AND IMPOSSIBLE TO TELL WHO IS WINNING
SINCE THERE IS NO WAY OF DECIDING WHO CONTROLS &quot;CONTESTED&quot;
VILLAGES.  GVN HAS HAD TO GIVE UP SOME TERRITORY IN
DELTA, WITH 200-300 OUTPOSTS &quot;CONSOLIDATED&quot; TO SAVE

FUEL AND AMMO, BUT DELTA DEPUTY COMMANDER SAYS ONLY
UNPOPULATED LAND GIVEN UP.  CASUALTIES RISE BECAUSE OF
RESTRICTIONS ON AMMO AND SUPPLIES IMPOSED BY PROSPECTIVE
US AID CUTS.

4.  PP PRESS REPORTS THAT MIL TRIBUNAL SENTENCES
TWO STUDENTS TO DEATH AND TEN TO LONG PRISON TERMS
FOR COMPLICITY IN DEATHS OF EDUCATION MINISTER AND
HIS AIDE DURING STUDENT DEMONSTRATIONS IN JUNE (UPI,
NYT).

5.  CHITRIB CARRIES KNIGHT NEWS ARTICLE ON MIAS &quot;WHOSE
FATES STILL BLOW IN THE WINDS&quot; OF SEA.  SAYS 994
UNACCOUNTED FOR, AND ABOUT ANOTHER 300 PRESUMED DEAD
BY DOD &quot;WITHOUT DECISIVE EVIDENCE&quot; EXCEPT TIME SINCE

LAST SEEN.  US INVESTIGATORS WERE RECENTLY LED TO
TWO BODIES BY SOUTH VIET CIVILIANS.  ASSTDEFSEC SHIELDS
SUPERVISES INVESTIGATION IN FACE OF NON-COOPERATION
BY NVN AND PAIN OF MIA FAMILIES.  NATIONAL LEAGUE
OF FAMILIES OPPOSES &quot;PRESUMPTIVE FINDINGS&quot; OF DEATH.
THERE HAVE BEEN CLAIMS THAT LEAGUE'S STAND IS BASED
ON DESIRE TO CONTINUE RECEIVING BENEFITS ONLY IF
SERVICEMEN ARE PRESUMED ALIVE.  SIMILARLY, THERE
HAVE BEEN SUGGESTIONS THAT DOD PRESUMPTIVE FINDINGS
OF DEATH WERE PARTLY AIMED AT REDUCING BENEFITS TO
DEPENDENTS.

6.  FROM PEKING, JOHN BURNS (WP) COVERS CODEL FULBRIGHT
ARRIVAL, MET AT AIRPORT WITHOUT CEREMONY BY BRUCE
AND CPIFA V-P CHOU.  HUMPHREY ADDED OWN TOUCH OF
INFORMALITY, DEPARTING FROM STILL PROTOCOL TO TAKE
SNAPSHOTS.  FULBRIGHT DECLINED SPEAK TO PRESS,
SAYING HE WANTED FIRST TO GET INTO VISIT.  BURNS
COMMENTS THAT THIS BEING FIRST IMPORTANT US DEL SINCE
TRANSFER OF PRESIDENTIAL POWER MAKES VISIT MORE THAN
ROUTINE EXERCISE.  CHINESE &quot;DOUBTLESS&quot; WILL PROBE TO
DETERMINE WHAT CHANGES MIGHT BE IN US ATTITUDE TOWARDS
SUCH QUESTIONS AS TAIWAN, AND WILL WANT TO LEARN
ABOUT ADMIN. STANCE ON OTHER FOREIGN POLICY MATTERS
SUCH AS DETENTE WITH USSR.

IT IS PROBABLE, BUT NOT CERTAIN, THAT CODEL WILL MEET
CHOU EN-LAI BEFORE DEPARTING FOR PROVINCES, BUT MOST

DISCUSSIONS LIKELY TO BE CONDUCTED BY CHIAO KUAN-HUA
AND TENG HSIAO-PING.

POSITION AS POSSIBLE AGENT OF RECONCILIATION WAS
MARKEDLY WEAKENED LAST MONTH WHEN IN SPEECH TO
LEGISLATURE HE HEAPED PRAISE ON AND CALLED FOR CLOSER

CHINA.

9.  IN FIRST DAY OF ASIAN GAMES, PRC, RETURNING FOR FIRST

ROKG DELIVERED FORMAL NOTE TO DEMAND INTENSIFIED
INVESTIGATIONS BY JAPANESE POLICE AND STRONG MEASURES
TO CONTROL &quot;SUBVERSIVE&quot; (ANTI-PARK) ACTIVITIES AMONG
KOREAN RESIDENTS IN JAPAN.

JAPANESE LEADERS RELUCTANT TO BECOME INVOLVED IN
POLITICS OF ASSASSINATION CASE, PARTICULARLY IF THIS
WILL BRING ON DOMESTIC CONFRONTATION WITH WELL-ORGANIZED
NK-ORIENTED CHOSOREN, WITH WHICH MUN IS ALLEGED TO
HAVE BEEN IN CONTACT, OR ANY OTHER GROUP AMONG THE
BITTER AND DIVIDED KOREAN MINORITY.  IF GOJ ACCEDES TO
ROKG DEMAND AND CURBS CHOSOREN OR ANTI-PARK ACTIVITIES,
SERIOUS INTERNAL PROBLEMS WOULD SURELY RESULT.  BUT
IF JAPAN REFUSES TO COOPERATE WITH PARK OR COOPERATES

ONLY IN MINIMAL WAYS, TROUBLE BETWEEN THEM IS LIKELY

NUMBER IMPOSSIBLE TO DETERMINE.

31.  FROM PHUHUONG, MCCOMBS (GLOBE) REPORTS THAT WAR

WAR SCRAP THAT THEY BUY FROM THE GOVT, MOSTLY TO
JAPAN, KOREA AND SINGAPORE.  BUT THERE IS ALSO A VAST
BLACK-MARKET IN WAR SCRAP, AND CONTROL IS ENORMOUS

EXPERTS AS DISAGREEING AS TO WHEN HANOI MIGHT LAUNCH
LARGE-SCALE INVASION, BUT AGREEING THAT IF AND WHEN
OFFENSIVE COMES, #GVN WILL BE UNABLE TO REPEL IT OR
EVEN SURVIVE.  EXPERTS SAY SVN'S MILITARY SITUATION
IS GRIM BECAUSE OF PAST AID CUTS AND RESULTING EFFECT
ON WEAPONS SUPPLIES.  ARVN DEATH RATE APPROACHING THAT
OF 1972 NVN OFFENSIVE AFTER DROP IN JAN-OCT 1973 RATE.
SVN'S CAPACITY TO RESPOND TO CURRENT MAJOR NVN
PROBES SEVERELY HAMPERED BY AMMO SHORTAGES AND HIGH
COST OF WAR MATERIAL, INCLUDING GASOLINE.

CITES OFFICIAL WITNESS TO SEVERAL SKIRMISHES BEING
APPALLED BY RELUCTANCE OF UNIT AND DIVISION COMMANDERS
TO EXPEND AMMO, WITH RESULTING DECLINE IN SOLDIER
MORALE; &quot;THE DECISION OFTEN IS TO USE BLOOD INSTEAD
OF BULLETS AND BOMBS.&quot;

CITES OFFICIALS THAT SINCE C-F, HANOI HAS INCREASED
ITS FORCES IN SVN WHICH EQUIPPED WITH IMPRESSIVE
ARRAY OF SOVIET-MADE WEAPONS, INCLUDING HAND-CARRIED
STRELA MISSILES AND 85 MM. MORTARS; THEY USE AMMO
FREELY.  ROUGH GUESS IS THAT NVN IS RECEIVING THREE
TIMES AS MUCH IN WEAPONS FROM USSR AND PRC AS IT DID
IN 1973; NVN ALSO PROVIDED WITH 1.2 BILLION DOLLARS
IN ECON AID.  US OFFICIALS UNCERTAIN WHY HANOI NOW
ON THE OFFENSIVE.  THEY BELIEVE THAT ITS STRATEGY IS
TO KEEP UP YEAR-ROUND PRESSURE - NOT AS STRONG AS IN
1972, BECAUSE OF POLITICAL RISKS INVOLVED, BUT STRONG
ENOUGH TO CAUSE SEVERE WEAR AND TEAR ON SVN TROOPS
AND EQUIPMENT.  SOME OFFICIALS CLAIM THAT HANOI
STEPPED UP PROBES BECAUSE OF ITS ASSESSMENT THAT CONGRESS
WILL NOT HELP SAIGON WITH MORE MIL AID.

1.  SHIPLER (NYT) FROM SAIGON SEES STRATEGY SHIFTS FORCED
ON GVN BY US AID CUTS.  TO SAVE FUEL AND AMMO, SOME
ISOLATED OUTPOSTS HAVE BEEN ABANDONED; &quot;HARRASSMENT
AND INTERDICTION&quot; ARTILLERY HAS VIRTUALLY ENDED; AND
SOME LARGE-UNIT OPERATIONS REPLACED BY SMALL, LONG-
UNCLASSIFIED

PAGE 02  STATE  193000

RANGE PATROLS.  ARMY OFFICERS, FOREIGN MIL MEN AND
GVN CIVILIANS DIFFER ON SIGNIFICANCE OF CHANGES.
SOME THINK THAT WITHDRAWAL FROM OUTPOSTS WILL CEDE LAND
TO COMMUNISTS AND PERHAPS FACILITATE FUTURE EFFORT TO
DRAW MAP DELINEATING AREAS OF CONTROL AS PRESCRIBED BY
C-F BUT RESISTED BY BOTH SIDES; OTHERS ARGUE THAT
OUTPOSTS ARE ONLY SYMBOLICALLY IMPORTANT AND SPREAD
FORCES TOO THINLY.  MIL MEN HAVE LONG DEBATED VALUE
OF H AND I FIRE AND SOME REGARD IT AS WASTE OF
AMMO AND THINK IT HURTS ;MOSTLY CIVILIANS, WHILE OTHERS
BELIEVE UNPREDICTABLE SHELLING HARASSES ENEMY AND
DAMAGES HIS MORALE.  SHIPLER FINDS WIDESPREAD AGREEMENT
THAT INCREASED LONG-RANGE PATROLS TARGETTED IN ENEMY
TERRITORY WILL WORK TO BENEFIT OF ARVN, NORMALLY
RESTRICTED TO DEFENSIVE POSTURE.

OUTPOST ABANDONMENT, MOST CONTROVERSIAL STRATEGY
CHANGE, EMERGED SIX-TO-NINE MONTHS AGO AS OCCASIONAL
&quot;EXCEPTIONS&quot; TO THIEU'S DIRECTIVE NOT TO GIVE AN INCH
TO THE COMMUNISTS.  EXCEPTIONS HAVE BECOME RULE AS
COMMUNISTS STEP UP ATTACKS AND CONGRESS CUTS AID.
INFORMED SOURCES SAY ABOUT 500 OF THE 3000 GVN OUTPOSTS
IN DELTA WILL BE &quot;CONSOLIDATED&quot; TO CONSERVE AMMO AND
FUEL.  ELSEWHERE, ABANDONMENT IS RELATED TO ENEMY
ATTACKS.  WESTERN DIPLOMAT SAYS THAT IN QUANG NAM AND
QUANG NGAI, COMMUNISTS ARE TAKING BACK WHAT THEY
CONSIDER TO BE THEIRS.  IN TAY NINH, WESTERN MIL
OFFICER SEES NVA ATTACKS RELATED TO OPENING NEW
LOGISTICAL CORRIDOR.  SHIPLER COMMENTS THAT USEFULNESS
OF SMALL OUTPOSTS HAS DECLINED AS RESULT OF DEVELOPMENT
OF MODERN LOGISTICS NETWORK BY NVA FOLLOWING END OF US
BOMBING; QUOTES FORMER USDAO GEN. MURRAY THAT HANOI
MUST HAVE A &quot;LOGISTICS GENIUS.&quot;  FOREIGN MIL OFFICER
NOTES THAT GVN ONCE USED TEN TIMES AS MUCH AMMO AS
COMMUNISTS; NOW RATIO HAS SHRUNK TO TWO-TO-ONE AND
COMMUNISTS &quot;GET COST EFFECTIVENESS OUT OF EVERY ROUND.&quot;
SHIPLER STATES THAT FEW BELIEVE STRATEGY CHANGES WILL
BREAK MIL STALEMATE SUDDENLY; QUOTES SVN OFFICER THAT
NEITHER SIDE HAS ENOUGH TROOPS TO OCCUPY THE WHOLE
COUNTRY.

SOME FARMERS PAY VC TAXES, AND YOUTHS WHO BECOME ELIGIBLE
FOR THE GVN DRAFT SOMETIMES CROSS INTO VC TERRITORY
WHERE, AS FAR AS ANYONE KNOWS, THEY ARE NOT INDUCTED
BUT ARE ALLOWED TO FARM.  SOME DRAFT EVADERS TAKE
FAMILIES WITH THEM.  ISAACS SEES DELTA WAR AS HAVING
DECEPTIVE SURFACE SINCE IT IS FOUGHT AT CLOSE RANGE IN
MANY SMALL CLASHES AND LEAVES FEWER SCARS THAN MORE
CONVENTIONAL FIGHTING.  VILLAGES ARE USUALLY PROSPEROUS
WITH REGION'S RICH AGRICULTURAL ECONOMY; AND GVN TROOPS
ARE DISPERSED TO DEFEND POPULATION.  HALF OF GVN MILLION -
MAN FORCE IS IN DELTA, SCATTERED IN VILLAGES, AND CONSTANT
&quot;PIN-PRICK BATTLES&quot; ACCOUNT FOR OVER HALF OF GVN CASUALTIE
ISAACS OBSERVES THAT WAR IS FOUGHT FOR POPULATION MORE
THAN FOR LAND, AND IMPOSSIBLE TO TELL WHO IS WINNING
SINCE THERE IS NO WAY OF DECIDING WHO CONTROLS &quot;CONTESTED&quot;
VILLAGES.  GVN HAS HAD TO GIVE UP SOME TERRITORY IN
DELTA, WITH 200-300 OUTPOSTS &quot;CONSOLIDATED&quot; TO SAVE

FUEL AND AMMO, BUT DELTA DEPUTY COMMANDER SAYS ONLY
UNPOPULATED LAND GIVEN UP.  CASUALTIES RISE BECAUSE OF
RESTRICTIONS ON AMMO AND SUPPLIES IMPOSED BY PROSPECTIVE
US AID CUTS.

COMMENT AND ANALYSIS

27.  WP'S OBERDORFER IN OSAKA DISCUSSES CASE OF ASSASSIN
MUN SE KWANG.  VIEWS MUN'S LIFE IN JAPAN AS REFLECTING
THOSE OF MANY OF HIS COMPATRIOTS LIVING IN POCKETS
OF POVERTY AS NEARLY FORGOTTEN, ALIENATED MINORITY -
MOST HAVE NO HOPE OF BECOMING JAPANESE CITIZENS.
MUN ALSO PRODUCT OF FACTIONAL POLITICS IN KOREAN
COMMUNITY - SPLIT INTO PRO- AND ANTI-COMMUNISTS; SAYS
THAT AS SERIOUS INTERNAL OPPOSITION WITHIN SK
CHALLENGED RHEE AND PARK, FISSURES DEVELOPED AMONG
ANTI-COMMUNIST KOREANS.

OBERDORFER REVIEWS MUN'S MOVES TO OBTAIN WEAPON FOR
ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT AND DEPART JAPAN FOR KOREA
UNDER JAPANESE PASSPORT.  REPORTS THAT ROKG IS EAGER
UNCLASSIFIED

PAGE 09  STATE  193000

TO GET CONVINCING EVIDENCE OF MUN INVOLVEMENT IN
COMMUNIST PLOT IN ATTEMPT TO SHORE UP ITS DIPLOMATIC
FORTUNES IN UN AND ELSEWHERE, SINCE SEOUL'S INTERNATIONAL
REPUTATION HAS BEEN SERIOUSLY DAMAGED BY RECENT WAVE
OF REPRESSION.  PARK SUMMONED JAPANESE AMBASSADOR, AND
ROKG DELIVERED FORMAL NOTE TO DEMAND INTENSIFIED
INVESTIGATIONS BY JAPANESE POLICE AND STRONG MEASURES
TO CONTROL &quot;SUBVERSIVE&quot; (ANTI-PARK) ACTIVITIES AMONG
KOREAN RESIDENTS IN JAPAN.

JAPANESE LEADERS RELUCTANT TO BECOME INVOLVED IN
POLITICS OF ASSASSINATION CASE, PARTICULARLY IF THIS
WILL BRING ON DOMESTIC CONFRONTATION WITH WELL-ORGANIZED
NK-ORIENTED CHOSOREN, WITH WHICH MUN IS ALLEGED TO
HAVE BEEN IN CONTACT, OR ANY OTHER GROUP AMONG THE
BITTER AND DIVIDED KOREAN MINORITY.  IF GOJ ACCEDES TO
ROKG DEMAND AND CURBS CHOSOREN OR ANTI-PARK ACTIVITIES,
SERIOUS INTERNAL PROBLEMS WOULD SURELY RESULT.  BUT
IF JAPAN REFUSES TO COOPERATE WITH PARK OR COOPERATES

ONLY IN MINIMAL WAYS, TROUBLE BETWEEN THEM IS LIKELY
TO INCREASE SHARPLY.

28.  CSM SEES SOME HOPE THAT REPRESSION IN SK WILL LESSEN
NOW THAT PARK TERMINATED TWO DECREES WHICH BANNED
SLIGHTEST OPPOSITION TO HIS RULE.  NOTES THAT LAST
WEEK, THE HEAD OF MAJOR OPPOSITION PARTY CALLED FOR
RESTORATION OF &quot;A DEMOCRATIC SYSTEM,&quot; AND EXPRESSES
HOPE THAT SUCH PLEAS ARE NOT ONLY PERMITTED BUT ARE
SOON IMPLEMENTED.

29.  IN LETTER TO WP EDITOR, SUGWON KANG, HARTWICK
COLLEGE PROF, CITES BUCKLEY INTERVIEW WITH PARK
(PUBLISHED IN MAY 24 NATIONAL REVIEW) AND OBERDORFER
REPORT (AUG 18 WP) ABOUT AMERICAN PREACHER, WILLIAM
BRIGHT, OF CAMPUS CRUSADE FOR CHRIST INTERNATIONAL
ON EVANGELISTIC TOUR OF KOREA, AS OFFERING &quot;COMIC
RELIEF&quot; IN OTHERWISE DEPRESSING SK POLITICAL
SITUATION.  NOTES THAT IN BUCKLEY INTERVIEW, &quot;PARK
COULD CALMLY REFLECT...THAT HE IS AN ADMIRER OF THE
AMERICAN FOUNDING FATHERS, VOICING HIS OPINION THAT
UNCLASSIFIED

PAGE 10  STATE  193000

'DEMOCRACY IS THE SOLE PATH TO PEACE AND HAPPINESS'
AND THAT 'WE MUST PRESERVE IT AT ALL COSTS.'&quot;  KANG
QUOTES BRIGHT AS BELIEVING THAT PARK WAS JUSTIFIED
IN THROWING CHRISTIAN DISSIDENTS IN JAIL ON GROUNDS
THAT THEIR ANTI-GOVT ACTIVITIES WOULD CAUSE NK REGIME
TO &quot;POUNCE ON THE REPUBLIC.&quot;  SAYS IF BRIGHT IS TRYING
TO AMUSE ANYONE, HE HAS GONE TO THE RIGHT PLACE FOR
HE IS SURE TO FIND AN APPRECIATIVE AUDIENCE IN PARK.

INDOCHINA

30.  WP'S MCCOMBS IN DANANG REPORTS MANY REFUGEES EAGER
TO RETURN TO OLD HOMES EVEN THOUGH IT MAY MEAN
LIVING UNDER COMMUNIST CONTROL BUT SOME ARE FORCIBLY
PREVENTED FROM DOING SO BY POLICE MEASURES AND REPRISALS
BY GOVT SOLDIERS.  DESIRE TO RETURN HOME ON PART OF
QUANGNGAI REFUGEES ATTRIBUTED TO END OF US AND GVN
ASSISTANCE.  REFUGEES SUPPORT THEMSELVES BY BUYING
TEA FROM MOUNTAIN TRIBESMEN AND SELLING IN CITY
MARKETS; CURRENT FIGHTING HAS MADE THIS IMPOSSIBLE.
NOTES THERE ARE ALSO MANY WHO WOULD RATHER REMAIN
ON GOVT SIDE THAN COME UNDER COMMUNIST CONTROL, BUT
NUMBER IMPOSSIBLE TO DETERMINE.

31.  FROM PHUHUONG, MCCOMBS (GLOBE) REPORTS THAT WAR
SCRAP EARNED 2.1 MILLION DOLLARS IN FOREX FOR GVN
DURING FIRST FIVE MONTHS OF 1974.  THERE ARE NOW
150 LARGE BUSINESSES IN SAIGON LEGALLY EXPORTING

WAR SCRAP THAT THEY BUY FROM THE GOVT, MOSTLY TO
JAPAN, KOREA AND SINGAPORE.  BUT THERE IS ALSO A VAST
BLACK-MARKET IN WAR SCRAP, AND CONTROL IS ENORMOUS
PROBLEM FOR GVN.  LAST MONTH, FOR EXAMPLE, PM'S
OFFICE REPORTED SMUGGLING RING'S ATTEMPT TO EXPORT
15,000 TONS OF COPPER WITH FORGED PERMIT.  ALSO,
RECENTLY, REP. ASPIN CHARGED THAT VIETS WERE TEARING
DOWN NEW AIRPLANES GIVEN THEM BY US AND SELLING
THEM ON BLACK MARKET FOR SCRAP.  HOWEVER, INVESTIGATIONS
BY AMEMB SAIGON AND BY NEWSMEN SHOWED THAT ASPIN CHARGE
WAS ERRONEOUS.  MCCOMBS CITES NEW RULES FOR WAR SCRAP
TRANSACTIONS PUT OUT BY PM'S OFFICE.

32.  GLOBE'S JHABVALA (SEPT 2) REPORTS SHARPLY STEPPED-UP
N VIET ATTACKS ON SVN AND DECREASING WILLINGNESS OF
CONGRESS TO AID SVN CAUSING SERIOUS CONCERN AMONG
SEA EXPERTS IN DOS AND DOD.  CITES US INTELLIGENCE
EXPERTS AS DISAGREEING AS TO WHEN HANOI MIGHT LAUNCH
LARGE-SCALE INVASION, BUT AGREEING THAT IF AND WHEN
OFFENSIVE COMES, #GVN WILL BE UNABLE TO REPEL IT OR
EVEN SURVIVE.  EXPERTS SAY SVN'S MILITARY SITUATION
IS GRIM BECAUSE OF PAST AID CUTS AND RESULTING EFFECT
ON WEAPONS SUPPLIES.  ARVN DEATH RATE APPROACHING THAT
OF 1972 NVN OFFENSIVE AFTER DROP IN JAN-OCT 1973 RATE.
SVN'S CAPACITY TO RESPOND TO CURRENT MAJOR NVN
PROBES SEVERELY HAMPERED BY AMMO SHORTAGES AND HIGH
COST OF WAR MATERIAL, INCLUDING GASOLINE.

CITES OFFICIAL WITNESS TO SEVERAL SKIRMISHES BEING
APPALLED BY RELUCTANCE OF UNIT AND DIVISION COMMANDERS
TO EXPEND AMMO, WITH RESULTING DECLINE IN SOLDIER
MORALE; &quot;THE DECISION OFTEN IS TO USE BLOOD INSTEAD
OF BULLETS AND BOMBS.&quot;

CITES OFFICIALS THAT SINCE C-F, HANOI HAS INCREASED
ITS FORCES IN SVN WHICH EQUIPPED WITH IMPRESSIVE
ARRAY OF SOVIET-MADE WEAPONS, INCLUDING HAND-CARRIED
STRELA MISSILES AND 85 MM. MORTARS; THEY USE AMMO
FREELY.  ROUGH GUESS IS THAT NVN IS RECEIVING THREE
TIMES AS MUCH IN WEAPONS FROM USSR AND PRC AS IT DID
IN 1973; NVN ALSO PROVIDED WITH 1.2 BILLION DOLLARS
IN ECON AID.  US OFFICIALS UNCERTAIN WHY HANOI NOW
ON THE OFFENSIVE.  THEY BELIEVE THAT ITS STRATEGY IS
TO KEEP UP YEAR-ROUND PRESSURE - NOT AS STRONG AS IN
1972, BECAUSE OF POLITICAL RISKS INVOLVED, BUT STRONG
ENOUGH TO CAUSE SEVERE WEAR AND TEAR ON SVN TROOPS
AND EQUIPMENT.  SOME OFFICIALS CLAIM THAT HANOI
STEPPED UP PROBES BECAUSE OF ITS ASSESSMENT THAT CONGRESS
WILL NOT HELP SAIGON WITH MORE MIL AID.

#NOTE - AT THIS POINT, EDITORS DELETED &quot;PROBABLY
NEXT SPRING.&quot;

DIEGO GARCIA

33.  CHITRIB EDITORIAL POINTS OUT THAT SOVIETS USE AT
LEAST THREE INDIAN OCEAN PORTS FOR VARIOUS PURPOSES,
BUT TASS &quot;CHASTISED&quot; PRES. FORD FOR CALLING THEM
BASES.  USSR USES &quot;FACILITIES&quot; IN IRAQ, S. YEMEN
AND SOMALIA; DENIES THAT THEY ARE NAVAL BASES.  CHITRIB
SEES PARALLEL TO THE 160,000 TROOPS THAT NVN INSISTS
AREN'T IN SVN, OR REVOLUTIONS AGAINST &quot;IMPERIALISM&quot;
THAT RED CHINA INSISTS AREN'T REALLY WARS.  CHITRIB
SUGGESTS THAT PRES. PLAY BY SAME RULES AND SAY THAT
ALL WE WANT ON DIEGO GARCIA IS &quot;HOSPITALITY HAVEN&quot;
OR &quot;COEXISTENCE MONITORING FACILITY.&quot;

34.  WARREN UNNA IN WP SEES SOMETHING GONE WRONG IN ADMIN'
PLAN FOR DIEGO GARCIA.  SAYS COLBY'S TESTIMONY
DRAMATIZED UNSUITABILITY AND INADEQUACY OF BASES
IN INDIAN OCEAN AVAILABLE TO USSR, IN CONTRAST TO
ADMIN TESTIMONY THAT MENTIONED &quot;FLEET ANCHORAGES&quot;
AND OTHER EXTENSIVE FACILITIES.  SINGAPORE WAS
MENTIONED AS PLACE WHERE SOVIETS HAVE BUNKERING
RIGHTS, BUT COLBY SAID SINGAPORE &quot;SELLS TO WHOEVER
HAPPENS TO GO BY.&quot;  UNNA QUOTES COLBY AGREEMENT WITH
SYMINGTON THAT SOVIET PRESENCE IN INDIAN OCEAN WILL
GROW &quot;REGARDLESS OF WHAT WE DO&quot;, AND WILL GROW FASTER
IF WE START DEVELOPING DIEGO GARCIA.

NYT'S GLADWIN HILL QUOTES DELEGATES' OPTIMISTIC
APPRAISAL OF ACHIEVEMENTS.  POINTS OUT THAT CHINA LED
&quot;ANTI-MALTHUSIAN&quot; BLOC THAT CHALLENGED NOTION THAT
BIG GLOBAL POPULATION IS UNDESIRABLE, AND SAID THAT
FULLER EXPLOITATION OS RESOURCES WOULD COMFORTABLY
