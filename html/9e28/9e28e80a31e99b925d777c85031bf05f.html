		<h3>Tor</h3>
		<p><a href="https://www.torproject.org">Tor</a> is an encrypted anonymising network that makes it harder to intercept internet communications, or see where communications are coming from or going to.</p>
		<p>In order to use the WikiLeaks public submission system as detailed above you can download the Tor Browser Bundle, which is a Firefox-like browser available for Windows, Mac OS X and GNU/Linux and pre-configured to connect using the anonymising system Tor.</p>
		<h4>Tails</h4>
		<p>If you are at high risk and you have the capacity to do so, you can also access the submission system through a secure operating system called <a href="https://tails.boum.org">Tails</a>. Tails is an operating system launched from a USB stick or a DVD that aim to leaves no traces when the computer is shut down after use and automatically routes your internet traffic through Tor. Tails will require you to have either a USB stick or a DVD at least 4GB big and a laptop or desktop computer.</p>

		<h3>Tips</h3>
		<p>Our submission system works hard to preserve your anonymity, but we recommend you also take some of your own precautions. Please review these basic guidelines. </p>
		<div>
			<h4>1. Contact us if you have specific problems</h4>
			<p>If you have a very large submission, or a submission with a complex format, or are a high-risk source, please <a href="#submit_help_contact">contact us</a>. In our experience it is always possible to find a custom solution for even the most seemingly difficult situations.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h4>2. What computer to use</h4>
			<p>If the computer you are uploading from could subsequently be audited in an investigation, consider using a computer that is not easily tied to you. Technical users can also use <a href="https://tails.boum.org">Tails</a> to help ensure you do not leave any records of your submission on the computer.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h4>3. Do not talk about your submission to others</h4>
			<p>If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in source protection – it is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This includes other media organisations.</p>
		</div>

	</div>

		<h3>After</h3>

		<div>
			<h4>1. Do not talk about your submission to others</h4>
			<p>If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in source protection – it is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This includes other media organisations.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h4>2. Act normal</h4>
			<p>If you are a high-risk source, avoid saying anything or doing anything after submitting which might promote suspicion. In particular, you should try to stick to your normal routine and behaviour.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h4>3. Remove traces of your submission</h4>
			<p>If you are a high-risk source and the computer you prepared your submission on, or uploaded it from, could subsequently be audited in an investigation, we recommend that you format and dispose of the computer hard drive and any other storage media you used.</p>
			<p>In particular, hard drives retain data after formatting which may be visible to a digital forensics team and flash media (USB sticks, memory cards and SSD drives) retain data even after a secure erasure. If you used flash media to store sensitive data, it is important to destroy the media.</p>
			<p>If you do this and are a high-risk source you should make sure there are no traces of the clean-up, since such traces themselves may draw suspicion.</p>
			<div>
				<h4>4. If you face legal action</h4>
				<p>If a legal action is brought against you as a result of your submission, there are organisations that may help you. The Courage Foundation is an international organisation dedicated to the protection of journalistic sources. You can find more details at <a href="https://www.couragefound.org">https://www.couragefound.org</a>.</p>

		<p>WikiLeaks publishes documents of political or historical importance that are censored or otherwise suppressed. We specialise in strategic global publishing and large archives.</p>
		<p>The following is the address of our secure site where you can anonymously upload your documents to WikiLeaks editors. You can only access this submissions system through Tor. (See our <a href="#submit_help_tor">Tor tab</a> for more information.) We also advise you to read our <a href="#submit_help_tips">tips for sources</a> before submitting.</p>

			<!--<div>
				Copy this address into your Tor browser. Advanced users, if they wish, can also add a further layer of encryption to their submission using <a href="#submit_wlkey">our public PGP key</a>.
			</div>-->
		</div>

		<p>If you cannot use Tor, or your submission is very large, or you have specific requirements, WikiLeaks provides several alternative methods. <a href="#submit_help_contact">Contact us</a> to discuss how to proceed.</p>

2. SUMMARY: AMBS YOUNG AND LEONARD FEB 28 MADE APPROACH
TO SOVIETS ON SECURITY COUNCIL ACTION ON SOUTHEAST ASIA
PURSUANT TO REFTEL. AMB TROYANOVSKY WAS UNYIELDING IN
REITERATING THE POSITION THAT THE SOVIETS FIND UNACCEPTABLE
AND WOULD VETO ANY SC RESOLUTION THAT DEALS IN ANY WAY
WITH MORE THAN THE CHINESE-VIETNAMESE DISPUTE. HE ARGUED
THAT A RESOLUTION DEALING WITH KAMPUCHEA, EVEN IN GENERAL
TERMS, ALONG WITH CHINA-VIETNAM, WOULD PROVIDE JUSTIFICATION FOR THE CHINESE ACTION AGAINST VIETNAM AND WOULD
TEND TO PERPETUATE CHINA'S REMAINING IN VIETNAM. HE
CLARIFIED HIS STATEMENT OF PREVIOUS EVENING IN SC CONCERNING POSSIBLE ACTION BY THE SYG FOLLOWING A CHINESE WITHDRAWAL, EXPLAINING THAT SUCH ACTIVITY COULD RELATE ONLY
TO CHINA-VIETNAM, NOT TO KAMPUCHEA. TROYANOVSKY ALSO
REJECTED THE IDEA OF A RESOLUTION THAT SIMPLY TRIED TO
ACTIVATE THE SYG'S GOOD OFFICES, SINCE CHINA IS STILL IN
CONFIDENTIAL

VIETNAM, AND ASSERTED THAT NO COUNCIL RESOLUTION WAS
NECESSARY. PRESSED FOR SOME IDEA OF WHAT THE USSR MIGHT
NOT VETO, HE FINALLY SUGGESTED THE POSSIBILITY OF A
&quot;FORMAL TYPE OF RESOLUTION&quot; BY WHICH THE SC, HAVING CONSIDERED THE MATTER AND EXPRESSING GRAVE CONCERN, WOULD
DECIDE TO REMAIN SEIZED OF THE MATTER. (THERE WAS NO
DISCUSSION OF HOW &quot;THE MATTER&quot; WOULD BE DESCRIBED).

AMB YOUNG SUGGESTED IT WOULD BE BETTER TO DECIDE TO MEET
AGAIN IN TWO WEEKS, RATHER THAN SIMPLY TO REMAIN SEIZED
OF THE QUESTION. TROYANOVSKY DID NOT KNOW WHETHER HE
COULD SUPPORT SUCH A RES BUT, AD REFERENDUM,THOUGHT HE
MIGHT BE AUTHORIZED TO ABSTAIN. DESPITE REPEATED EFFORTS
TO PERSUADE TROYANOVSKY THAT THE SOVIET ATTITUDE WAS
FRUSTRATING A GENERAL DESIRE OF COUNCIL MEMBERS TO TAKE
ACTION WHICH MOST WOULD SEE AS AIMED AT CHINA FOR ITS
ATTACK ON VIETNAM AND THAT IT WAS CLEAR THAT, DESPITE
THEIR STRONG VIEWS ON KAMPUCHEA, SC MEMBERS DID NOT CONSIDER THE CHINESE ACTION JUSTIFIED BY WHAT HAPPENED IN
KAMPUCHEA, TROYANOVSKY SHOWED NO FLEXIBILITY OR WILLINGNESS TO SEEK A MUTUALLY ACCEPTABLE WAY OUT OF THE EXISTING IMPASSE. HE WARNED THAT IF THE US SHOULD VOTE FOR
A RESOLUTION (SUCH AS THE ASEAN TEXT) WITH THE CHINESE,
&quot;YOU WOULD FIND YOURSELVES IN DIFFICULTIES.&quot; END SUMMARY.
3. AMBS YOUNG AND LEONARD AND POLCOUNS MET AT 11:00 AM
FEB 28 WITH SOVIET AMB TROYANOVSKY AND MINISTER LOZINSKY
TO CARRY OUT REFTEL INSTRUCTIONS. EXPLAINING THAT HE
HAD REQUESTED THE MEETING UNDER INSTRUCTIONS, AMB YOUNG
OUTLINED US VIEWS ALONG LINES REFTEL AND DREW ATTENTION
TO POINTS HE HAD MADE IN HIS STATEMENT IN THE SECURITY
COUNCIL THE NIGHT BEFORE (USUN 826). POINTING OUT THAT
WE WERE INTERESTED IN FINDING A WAY TO ENCOURAGE CHINA
TO LEAVE VIETNAM, YOUNG NOTED THE LIKELIHOOD OF A SUBCONFIDENTIAL

STANTIAL DISLOCATION IN THE AREA AND HIGH CASUALTIES IF
AS SEEMED INEVITABLE A MAJOR CLASH SHOULD OCCUR BETWEEN
CHINA AND VIETNAM. HE REITERATED THAT WE DO NOT MAKE
ANY LINKAGE BETWEEN WITHDRAWAL OF CHINA FROM VIETNAM AND
OF VIETNAM FROM CAMBODIA, THAT ONE ACTION IS NOT CONDITIONAL UPON THE OTHER. HOWEVER, WE HAD TO BE CONSISTENT
IN OUR POSITION ON KAMPUCHEA. YOUNG POINTED OUT THAT
THE US DID NOT LIKE THE POL POT REGIME ANYMORE THAN THE
SOVIETS AND WOULD HAVE BEEN HAPPY TO SEE IT REPLACED
THROUGH SOME MEANS OTHER THAN MILITARY ACTION. HE
THOUGHT US AND USSR INTERESTS WERE &quot;NOT THAT FAR APART
IN THE REGION&quot;, YET WE SEEMED TO BE ON OPPOSITE SIDES.
HE HAD THE IMPRESSION FROM SOME OF THE SOVIET STATEMENTS
IN THE SC AND IN CONVERSATIONS WITH US THAT WE COULD
PERHAPS AGREE ON SOME WAY FOR THE SC TO ACT IN THIS
SITUATION - PERHAPS TO ACTIVATE THE SYG'S GOOD OFFICES.
IF THE SC DOES NOT ACT, YOUNG POINTED OUT, IT WOULD GIVE
CHINA COMFORT AND ADDITIONAL TIME FOR ITS ACTIONS IN
VIETNAM. A BODY OF INTERNATIONAL OPINION FOR CHINESE
WITHDRAWAL HAS BEEN BUILDING UP, HE NOTED; THIS WAS REFLECTED IN ALMOST ALL SC STATEMENTS.

4. SUPPLEMENTING AMB YOUNG'S PRESENTATION, AMB LEONARD
EMPHASIZED THE IMPORTANCE AT THIS POINT OF PUTTING AN
END TO THE HOSTILITIES AND INSTITUTING A DIPLOMATIC PROCESS THROUGH WHICH THE PARTIES COULD RESOLVE THEIR DIFFERENCES. IN THIS CONNECTION HE NOTED TROYANOVSKY'S STATEMENT IN THE SC THE NIGHT BEFORE INDICATING THAT ONLY
AFTER THE END OF HOSTILITIES IN VIETNAM AND CHINESE
WITHDRAWAL COULD THE PARTIES TAKE UP THE SYG'S OFFER OF
GOOD OFFICES.
5. TROYANOVSKY RESPONDED THAT ANY LINKAGE IN A SC RESOLUCONFIDENTIAL

TION WAS UNACCEPTABLE AS IT WOULD SEEM TO BE A JUSTIFICATION FOR THE CHINESE ACTION. &quot;NO WONDER DENG XIAOPING
WELCOMED&quot; SUCH A RESOLUTION, HE SAID, AS IT WOULD TEND
TO PERPETUATE CHINA'S STAYING IN VIETNAM. CHINA, HE
ARGUED, WOULD SAY THAT VIETNAM WAS NOT WITHDRAWING, SO
WHY SHOULD WE. APPARENTLY REFERRING TO THE ASEAN AND
THE ABORTIVE BISHARA DRAFT RESOLUTIONS, TROYANOVSKY
SAID THE SC HAS LINKED THE TWO SITUATIONS, SO THE USSR
WOULD HAVE TO VOTE NO. HE NOTED THAT CHINA WOULD APPARENTLY VOTE FOR THE ASEAN TEXT AND WARNED THAT &quot;YOU WOULD
FIND YOURSELVES IN DIFFICULTIES IF YOU VOTED FOR A RESOLUTION WITH THE CHINESE.&quot; THE US WOULD BE HELPING CHINA,
HE ASSERTED, ADDING &quot;I SEE NO WAY OUT.&quot;
6. LEONARD SUGGESTED THAT WE HAD A SIMILAR OBJECTIVE,
WHICH HE WOULD HAVE THOUGHT VIETNAM ALSO SHARED. WHEN
TROYANOVSKY INTERJECTED THAT &quot;YOU MUST THEN BREAK THE
LINK&quot;, LEONARD ASKED HOW THIS COULD BE DONE, SINCE THE
CHINESE ACTION CLEARLY GREW OUT OF VIETNAM'S ACTION, ON
WHICH MANY COUNTRIES HAD EXPRESSED THEIR VIEWS IN THE SC.

THIS HISTORY COULD NOT BE ERASED. TROYANOVSKY REPLIED

7. LEONARD ASKED WHETHER ANYTHING COULD BE DONE AFTER A
CHINESE WITHDRAWAL. COULD THERE BE A CALL FOR A CEASEFIRE AND ACTIVATION OF THE SYG'S GOOD OFFICES, OR EVEN
JUST THE LATTER. TROYANOVSKY SAID NO TO BOTH. THERE
WAS AN EXCHANGE ABOUT THE SOVIET STATEMENTS INDICATING
THAT NO TALKS WERE POSSIBLE UNTIL CHINA ENDS ITS &quot;AGGRESSION&quot;, WITH LEONARD ASKING IF THIS COULD AT LEAST BE PUT
IN POSITIVE, RATHER THAN NEGATIVE TERMS. WITHOUT RESPONDING DIRECTLY TO THIS QUESTION, TROYANOVSKY SAID ANY
TALKS THAT FOLLOWED A CHINESE WITHDRAWAL COULD TAKE PLACE
ONLY IN REGARD TO VIETNAM'S DISPUTE WITH THE CHINESE, NOT
TO KAMPUCHEA. LEONARD NOTED THAT IF NEGOTIATIONS WERE
TO BE LIMITED ONLY TO THE SINO-VIETNAM BORDER PROBLEM,
IT WOULD NOT HELP MUCH, TO WHICH TROYANOVSKY REPLIED
THAT THAT WAS THE VIETNAMESE POSITION. LEONARD SUGGESTED
THAT PERHAPS VIETNAM WOULD NOT HAVE TO STATE EXPLICITLY
THAT IT WAS PREPARED TO TALK ABOUT KAMPUCHEA, BUT THE
SOVIET UNION COULD TELL US PRIVATELY THAT THE POSSIBILITY
EXISTED FOR VIETNAM TO ENGAGE IN SUCH TALKS. TROYANOVSKY
DID NOT SEE HOW VIETNAM COULD TALK ABOUT KAMPUCHEA.
8. YOUNG EXPRESSED THE VIEW THAT THE CHINESE COULD NOT
AFFORD A KAMPUCHEA TOTALLY UNDER VIETNAMESE CONTROL AND
VIETNAM COULD NOT AFFORD A KAMPUCHEA UNDER CHINESE DOMINATION. HE HOPED THERE WOULD BE A POSSIBILITY OF WORKING
TOWARD SOMETHING ACCEPTABLE TO BOTH. IN THIS CONNECTION
THERE WAS A BRIEF DISCUSSION OF CHINA'S ATTITUDE TOWARD
SIHANOUK AND RECENT INDICATIONS THAT CHINA MAY BE TRYING
TO DISTANCE ITSELF FROM POL POT. TROYANOVSKY'S ONLY
REACTION WAS THAT CHINA CONTINUES TO HELP &quot;THE REMNANTS&quot;
OF THE POL POT REGIME.

AMB YOUNG EXPRESSED CONCERN OVER THE POSSIBLE DAMAGE TO
US/SOVIET RELATIONS IN THE PRESENT SITUATION. HE NOTED
THAT CHINA HAD GONE INTO VIETNAM TO SAVE FACE AND WOULD

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
NOT GET OUT LOSING FACE. THE RESULT COULD BE THE SLAUGHTER OF THOUSANDS. TROYANOVSKY NOTED THE LIMITED ROOM FOR
MANEUVER IN THE SC AND ASKED WNY ANY SC DECISION WAS
NEEDED. HE ASSERTED THAT THERE HAD BEEN &quot;NUMEROUS
INSTANCES&quot; OF FIGHTING IN WHICH THE SC HAD COME TO A
STAGE WHEN IT HAD DECIDED NOT TO TAKE ANY ACTION. WHEN
LEONARD ARGUED AGAINST THIS POSITION, TROYANOVSKY SAID,
&quot;WE CANNOT LET THE CHINESE OFF THE HOOK. WE MUST HAVE
A RESOLUTION DEPLORING CHINA'S ACTION AND ASKING FOR
WITHDRAWAL.&quot;
10. LEONARD ASKED IF THE SOVIETS HAD EXPLORED WITH THE NONALIGNED SC MEMBERS THE POSSIBILITY OF A MODERATE RESOLUTION DEALING ONLY WITH THE CHINESE ATTACK. TROYANOVSKY
SAID HE HAD NOT AND THOUGHT ANY EFFORT TO AMEND THE
TEXTS CIRCULATING INFORMALLY (I.E. ASEAN AND BISHARA)
WOULD INVOLVE SUCH EXTENSIVE REVISION AS TO CHANGE THE
CHARACTER OF THE RESOLUTION. TROYANOVSKY ASKED WHETHER
WE PREFERRED THE ASEAN TEXT OR THAT DEVELOPED BY SC PRESIDENT BISHARA. LEONARD POINTED OUT THAT THE LATTER TEXT
HAD BEEN DEVELOPED IN AN EFFORT TO MEET SOME OF THE SOVIET
CRITICISMS OF THE ASEAN DRAFT. TROYANOVSKY NOTED THAT
CHINA WOULD APPARENTLY VOTE FOR THE ASEAN TEXT, WHICH THE
USSR WOULD VETO, AND THAT THERE WOULD BE TWO VETOS OF
THE BISHARA TEXT. HE DID NOT KNOW WHICH WOULD BE
BETTER &quot;FOR US&quot;.
11. SEEMING TO BE THINKING OUT LOUD, TROYANOVSKY WONDERED

MAIN SEIZED OF &quot;THE MATTER&quot;. YOUNG SAID HE WOULD PREFER,
IN PLACE OF THE LAST PROVISION, A DECISION TO MEET AGAIN
IN TWO WEEKS. HE THOUGHT THERE WAS SOME PRESSURE MOUNTING FROM THE SC MEETINGS AND SCHEDULING ANOTHER ONE TWO
WEEKS HENCE WOULD HELP KEEP THE PRESSURE UP. TROYANOVSKY
SAID HE DID NOT KNOW WHETHER THE USSR COULD SUPPORT SUCH
A RESOLUTION, BUT PERHAPS IT COULD ABSTAIN, ALTHOUGH THIS
STATEMENT WAS OF COURSE AD REFERENDUM. (COMMENT: IT WAS
NOT CLEAR WHETHER THIS STATEMENT REFERRED TO THE RESOLUTION HE HAD OUTLINED OR TO THE VERSION MENTIONED BY AMB
YOUNG, OR TO BOTH. IT SHOULD ALSO BE NOTED THAT THERE
WAS NO DISCUSSION OF HOW &quot;THE MATTER&quot; WOULD BE DESCRIBED
IN SUCH A RESOLUTION, A QUESTION THAT WOULD INVOLVE THE
SAME PROBLEM THAT HAS COMPLICATED ALL OF THE OTHER DRAFTING EFFORTS.)
12. LEONARD POINTED OUT THAT IN PURSUING THIS QUESTION
WE ALSO HAVE THE INTERESTS OF THE INSTITUTION IN MIND.
IF THE SC COULD COME TO NO DECISION IN THE FACE OF A
MAJOR MILITARY OPERATION BY A PERMANENT SC
MEMBER SUCH AS CHINA HAS MOUNTED, THIS WOULD BE RATHER
AN INDICTMENT OF THE INSTITUTION. EVEN A VETOED RESOLUTION THAT HAD THE SUPPORT OF MOST SC MEMBERS WOULD HAVE

AN EFFECT, LEONARD THOUGHT, BUT HE EMPHASIZED OUR DESIRE
TO FIND A BASIS FOR A DIALOGUE WITH THE SOVIETS ON
SOUTHEAST ASIA. TROYANOVSKY SAID THE USSR WAS NOT A
SOUTHEAST ASIA POWER, WHILE VIETNAM IS. IT WAS UP TO
THE VIETNAMESE TO DECIDE &quot;IN MANY INSTANCES&quot;. LEONARD
NOTED, HOWEVER, THAT THE SOVIET UNION WAS A VERY GOOD
FRIEND AND TREATY ALLY OF VIETNAM. TROYANOVSKY REPEATED
HIS POINT THAT THERE COULD BE NO ACTION THAT EVEN INDIRECTLY PERMITTED CHINA TO JUSTIFY ITS ACTION, AND LOZINSKY
ASKED IF THERE WAS NOT SOME WAY WE COULD &quot;OVERCOME THE
CONTRADICTION&quot; IN OUR POSITION THAT LINKS THE TWO QUESTIONS.
YOUNG NOTED THAT THE VIETNAMESE ACTION WAS A MASSIVE INVASION AND COULD NOT BE IGNORED. LOZINSKY POINTED OUT
THAT THE SC HAD ALREADY CONSIDERED THE KAMPUCHEAN SITUATION IN JANUARY UNDER A SPECIFIC AGENDA ITEM. NOW IT
SHOULD DO THE SAME RE CHINA-VIETNAM, AND NOT LINK THE
TWO TOGETHER.
13. DURING A FINAL EXCHANGE TROYANOVSKY REPEATED THE
COMMENT HE HAD MADE TO LEONARD ON FEB 26 CONCERNING THE
US &quot;DOUBLE STANDARD&quot; IN ITS HANDLING OF THE CURRENT
BLUMENTHAL VISIT TO CHINA AS OPPOSED TO THE POSTPONEMENT
OF BLUMENTHAL'S TRIP TO MOSCOW BECAUSE OF THE SHCHARANSKY

E.O. 12065: RDS-3 2/27/91 (LEONARD, JAMES F.) OR-M
TAGS: PORG, MOPS, UNSC, CB, CH, VM, UR, US
SUBJECT: (U) YOUNG/LEONARD CONVERSATION WITH TROYANOVSKY
ON SOUTHEAST ASIA FEB 28.
REF: STATE 47577
1. (C-ENTIRE TEXT).
2. SUMMARY: AMBS YOUNG AND LEONARD FEB 28 MADE APPROACH
TO SOVIETS ON SECURITY COUNCIL ACTION ON SOUTHEAST ASIA
PURSUANT TO REFTEL. AMB TROYANOVSKY WAS UNYIELDING IN
REITERATING THE POSITION THAT THE SOVIETS FIND UNACCEPTABLE
AND WOULD VETO ANY SC RESOLUTION THAT DEALS IN ANY WAY
WITH MORE THAN THE CHINESE-VIETNAMESE DISPUTE. HE ARGUED
THAT A RESOLUTION DEALING WITH KAMPUCHEA, EVEN IN GENERAL
TERMS, ALONG WITH CHINA-VIETNAM, WOULD PROVIDE JUSTIFICATION FOR THE CHINESE ACTION AGAINST VIETNAM AND WOULD
TEND TO PERPETUATE CHINA'S REMAINING IN VIETNAM. HE
CLARIFIED HIS STATEMENT OF PREVIOUS EVENING IN SC CONCERNING POSSIBLE ACTION BY THE SYG FOLLOWING A CHINESE WITHDRAWAL, EXPLAINING THAT SUCH ACTIVITY COULD RELATE ONLY
TO CHINA-VIETNAM, NOT TO KAMPUCHEA. TROYANOVSKY ALSO
REJECTED THE IDEA OF A RESOLUTION THAT SIMPLY TRIED TO
ACTIVATE THE SYG'S GOOD OFFICES, SINCE CHINA IS STILL IN

USUN N 00859 01 OF 03 010358Z

VIETNAM, AND ASSERTED THAT NO COUNCIL RESOLUTION WAS
NECESSARY. PRESSED FOR SOME IDEA OF WHAT THE USSR MIGHT
NOT VETO, HE FINALLY SUGGESTED THE POSSIBILITY OF A
&quot;FORMAL TYPE OF RESOLUTION&quot; BY WHICH THE SC, HAVING CONSIDERED THE MATTER AND EXPRESSING GRAVE CONCERN, WOULD
DECIDE TO REMAIN SEIZED OF THE MATTER. (THERE WAS NO
DISCUSSION OF HOW &quot;THE MATTER&quot; WOULD BE DESCRIBED).

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
AMB YOUNG SUGGESTED IT WOULD BE BETTER TO DECIDE TO MEET
AGAIN IN TWO WEEKS, RATHER THAN SIMPLY TO REMAIN SEIZED
OF THE QUESTION. TROYANOVSKY DID NOT KNOW WHETHER HE
COULD SUPPORT SUCH A RES BUT, AD REFERENDUM,THOUGHT HE
MIGHT BE AUTHORIZED TO ABSTAIN. DESPITE REPEATED EFFORTS
TO PERSUADE TROYANOVSKY THAT THE SOVIET ATTITUDE WAS
FRUSTRATING A GENERAL DESIRE OF COUNCIL MEMBERS TO TAKE
ACTION WHICH MOST WOULD SEE AS AIMED AT CHINA FOR ITS
ATTACK ON VIETNAM AND THAT IT WAS CLEAR THAT, DESPITE
THEIR STRONG VIEWS ON KAMPUCHEA, SC MEMBERS DID NOT CONSIDER THE CHINESE ACTION JUSTIFIED BY WHAT HAPPENED IN
KAMPUCHEA, TROYANOVSKY SHOWED NO FLEXIBILITY OR WILLINGNESS TO SEEK A MUTUALLY ACCEPTABLE WAY OUT OF THE EXISTING IMPASSE. HE WARNED THAT IF THE US SHOULD VOTE FOR
A RESOLUTION (SUCH AS THE ASEAN TEXT) WITH THE CHINESE,
&quot;YOU WOULD FIND YOURSELVES IN DIFFICULTIES.&quot; END SUMMARY.
3. AMBS YOUNG AND LEONARD AND POLCOUNS MET AT 11:00 AM
FEB 28 WITH SOVIET AMB TROYANOVSKY AND MINISTER LOZINSKY
TO CARRY OUT REFTEL INSTRUCTIONS. EXPLAINING THAT HE
HAD REQUESTED THE MEETING UNDER INSTRUCTIONS, AMB YOUNG
OUTLINED US VIEWS ALONG LINES REFTEL AND DREW ATTENTION
TO POINTS HE HAD MADE IN HIS STATEMENT IN THE SECURITY
COUNCIL THE NIGHT BEFORE (USUN 826). POINTING OUT THAT
WE WERE INTERESTED IN FINDING A WAY TO ENCOURAGE CHINA
TO LEAVE VIETNAM, YOUNG NOTED THE LIKELIHOOD OF A SUBCONFIDENTIAL

STANTIAL DISLOCATION IN THE AREA AND HIGH CASUALTIES IF
AS SEEMED INEVITABLE A MAJOR CLASH SHOULD OCCUR BETWEEN
CHINA AND VIETNAM. HE REITERATED THAT WE DO NOT MAKE
ANY LINKAGE BETWEEN WITHDRAWAL OF CHINA FROM VIETNAM AND
OF VIETNAM FROM CAMBODIA, THAT ONE ACTION IS NOT CONDITIONAL UPON THE OTHER. HOWEVER, WE HAD TO BE CONSISTENT
IN OUR POSITION ON KAMPUCHEA. YOUNG POINTED OUT THAT
THE US DID NOT LIKE THE POL POT REGIME ANYMORE THAN THE
SOVIETS AND WOULD HAVE BEEN HAPPY TO SEE IT REPLACED
THROUGH SOME MEANS OTHER THAN MILITARY ACTION. HE
THOUGHT US AND USSR INTERESTS WERE &quot;NOT THAT FAR APART
IN THE REGION&quot;, YET WE SEEMED TO BE ON OPPOSITE SIDES.
HE HAD THE IMPRESSION FROM SOME OF THE SOVIET STATEMENTS
IN THE SC AND IN CONVERSATIONS WITH US THAT WE COULD
PERHAPS AGREE ON SOME WAY FOR THE SC TO ACT IN THIS
SITUATION - PERHAPS TO ACTIVATE THE SYG'S GOOD OFFICES.
IF THE SC DOES NOT ACT, YOUNG POINTED OUT, IT WOULD GIVE
CHINA COMFORT AND ADDITIONAL TIME FOR ITS ACTIONS IN
VIETNAM. A BODY OF INTERNATIONAL OPINION FOR CHINESE
WITHDRAWAL HAS BEEN BUILDING UP, HE NOTED; THIS WAS REFLECTED IN ALMOST ALL SC STATEMENTS.

4. SUPPLEMENTING AMB YOUNG'S PRESENTATION, AMB LEONARD
EMPHASIZED THE IMPORTANCE AT THIS POINT OF PUTTING AN
END TO THE HOSTILITIES AND INSTITUTING A DIPLOMATIC PROCESS THROUGH WHICH THE PARTIES COULD RESOLVE THEIR DIFFERENCES. IN THIS CONNECTION HE NOTED TROYANOVSKY'S STATEMENT IN THE SC THE NIGHT BEFORE INDICATING THAT ONLY
AFTER THE END OF HOSTILITIES IN VIETNAM AND CHINESE
WITHDRAWAL COULD THE PARTIES TAKE UP THE SYG'S OFFER OF
GOOD OFFICES.

TION WAS UNACCEPTABLE AS IT WOULD SEEM TO BE A JUSTIFICATION FOR THE CHINESE ACTION. &quot;NO WONDER DENG XIAOPING
WELCOMED&quot; SUCH A RESOLUTION, HE SAID, AS IT WOULD TEND
TO PERPETUATE CHINA'S STAYING IN VIETNAM. CHINA, HE
ARGUED, WOULD SAY THAT VIETNAM WAS NOT WITHDRAWING, SO
WHY SHOULD WE. APPARENTLY REFERRING TO THE ASEAN AND
THE ABORTIVE BISHARA DRAFT RESOLUTIONS, TROYANOVSKY
SAID THE SC HAS LINKED THE TWO SITUATIONS, SO THE USSR
WOULD HAVE TO VOTE NO. HE NOTED THAT CHINA WOULD APPARENTLY VOTE FOR THE ASEAN TEXT AND WARNED THAT &quot;YOU WOULD
FIND YOURSELVES IN DIFFICULTIES IF YOU VOTED FOR A RESOLUTION WITH THE CHINESE.&quot; THE US WOULD BE HELPING CHINA,
HE ASSERTED, ADDING &quot;I SEE NO WAY OUT.&quot;
6. LEONARD SUGGESTED THAT WE HAD A SIMILAR OBJECTIVE,
WHICH HE WOULD HAVE THOUGHT VIETNAM ALSO SHARED. WHEN
TROYANOVSKY INTERJECTED THAT &quot;YOU MUST THEN BREAK THE
LINK&quot;, LEONARD ASKED HOW THIS COULD BE DONE, SINCE THE
CHINESE ACTION CLEARLY GREW OUT OF VIETNAM'S ACTION, ON
WHICH MANY COUNTRIES HAD EXPRESSED THEIR VIEWS IN THE SC.

THIS HISTORY COULD NOT BE ERASED. TROYANOVSKY REPLIED

A JUSTIFICATION FOR THE CHINESE ACTION, AND ANYTHING
