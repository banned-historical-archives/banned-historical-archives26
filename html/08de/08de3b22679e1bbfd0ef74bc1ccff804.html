		<h3>Tor</h3>
		<p><a href="https://www.torproject.org">Tor</a> is an encrypted anonymising network that makes it harder to intercept internet communications, or see where communications are coming from or going to.</p>
		<p>In order to use the WikiLeaks public submission system as detailed above you can download the Tor Browser Bundle, which is a Firefox-like browser available for Windows, Mac OS X and GNU/Linux and pre-configured to connect using the anonymising system Tor.</p>
		<h4>Tails</h4>
		<p>If you are at high risk and you have the capacity to do so, you can also access the submission system through a secure operating system called <a href="https://tails.boum.org">Tails</a>. Tails is an operating system launched from a USB stick or a DVD that aim to leaves no traces when the computer is shut down after use and automatically routes your internet traffic through Tor. Tails will require you to have either a USB stick or a DVD at least 4GB big and a laptop or desktop computer.</p>

		<h3>Tips</h3>
		<p>Our submission system works hard to preserve your anonymity, but we recommend you also take some of your own precautions. Please review these basic guidelines. </p>
		<div>
			<h4>1. Contact us if you have specific problems</h4>
			<p>If you have a very large submission, or a submission with a complex format, or are a high-risk source, please <a href="#submit_help_contact">contact us</a>. In our experience it is always possible to find a custom solution for even the most seemingly difficult situations.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h4>2. What computer to use</h4>
			<p>If the computer you are uploading from could subsequently be audited in an investigation, consider using a computer that is not easily tied to you. Technical users can also use <a href="https://tails.boum.org">Tails</a> to help ensure you do not leave any records of your submission on the computer.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h4>3. Do not talk about your submission to others</h4>
			<p>If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in source protection – it is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This includes other media organisations.</p>
		</div>

	</div>

		<h3>After</h3>

		<div>
			<h4>1. Do not talk about your submission to others</h4>
			<p>If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in source protection – it is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This includes other media organisations.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h4>2. Act normal</h4>
			<p>If you are a high-risk source, avoid saying anything or doing anything after submitting which might promote suspicion. In particular, you should try to stick to your normal routine and behaviour.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h4>3. Remove traces of your submission</h4>
			<p>If you are a high-risk source and the computer you prepared your submission on, or uploaded it from, could subsequently be audited in an investigation, we recommend that you format and dispose of the computer hard drive and any other storage media you used.</p>
			<p>In particular, hard drives retain data after formatting which may be visible to a digital forensics team and flash media (USB sticks, memory cards and SSD drives) retain data even after a secure erasure. If you used flash media to store sensitive data, it is important to destroy the media.</p>
			<p>If you do this and are a high-risk source you should make sure there are no traces of the clean-up, since such traces themselves may draw suspicion.</p>
			<div>
				<h4>4. If you face legal action</h4>
				<p>If a legal action is brought against you as a result of your submission, there are organisations that may help you. The Courage Foundation is an international organisation dedicated to the protection of journalistic sources. You can find more details at <a href="https://www.couragefound.org">https://www.couragefound.org</a>.</p>

		<p>WikiLeaks publishes documents of political or historical importance that are censored or otherwise suppressed. We specialise in strategic global publishing and large archives.</p>
		<p>The following is the address of our secure site where you can anonymously upload your documents to WikiLeaks editors. You can only access this submissions system through Tor. (See our <a href="#submit_help_tor">Tor tab</a> for more information.) We also advise you to read our <a href="#submit_help_tips">tips for sources</a> before submitting.</p>

			<!--<div>
				Copy this address into your Tor browser. Advanced users, if they wish, can also add a further layer of encryption to their submission using <a href="#submit_wlkey">our public PGP key</a>.
			</div>-->
		</div>

		<p>If you cannot use Tor, or your submission is very large, or you have specific requirements, WikiLeaks provides several alternative methods. <a href="#submit_help_contact">Contact us</a> to discuss how to proceed.</p>

DINNER HELD BY HARVARD BUSINESS SCHOOL CLUB OF NY, REPLYING
TO QUESTIONS, SAID HE DOES NOT EXPECT CURRENT PRC FACTIONAL
UNREST WILL EFFECT ANY CHANGE OF DIRECTION IN PEKING'S
RELATIONS WITH US, OR SOVIET.  ADDED THAT PRC HAD NO
INTENTION INTERFERRING IN INTERNAL US POLITICS BY INVITING
NIXON; SAID CHINESE JUST DON'T THINK THAT WAY, AND NOTED
NIXON TRIP COINCIDED WITH FOURTH ANNIVERSARY SHANGHAI

WEEK AGO THAT PRC HAS NE' MISSILE THAT COULD STRIKE TARGETS
&quot;CLOSE TO MOSCOW,&quot; BUT MOST CHINESE MTL EQUIPMENT OUTDATED,
SOME 10-20 YEARS BEHIND TIMES.  ABRAMOWITZ DECLARED PRC
SELF-RELIANCE POLICY HAS PEEN &quot;POWERFUL POLITICAL AND
ECONOMIC TOOL,&quot; BUT WILL BE INSUFFICIENT TO MODERNIZE HER
ARMED FORCES, SO PEKING MUST TURN APROAD FOR MORE
SOPHISTICATED WEAPONS OF TODAY.  ADDED THAT PEKING HAS NOT

REQUESTED US MIL AID, THOUGH HAS SOUGHT CERTAIN US
HIGH-TECHNOLOGY EQUIPMENT; ALSO SATD THERE IS EVIDENCE
OF UPTURN IN CHINESE MIL SPENDING IN PAST YEAR AFTER

ARE DEPLOYED TO DEFEND N, NE PART OF COUNTRY, AND ON
THEIR SIDE SOVIETS HAVE DEPLOYED FORCES EXCEEDING WHAT
WOULD BE NEEDED TO STOP CHINESE ATTACK.  SAID THIS
NECESSITY FOR PRC DEFENSE, LIMITING CHINESE AND SOVIET
OPTIONS, HAS BEEN MAJOR FACTOR IN MUTING PEKING'S
HOSTILITY TO US MIL PRESENCE IN ASIA.

CORDDRY OBSERVES WHILE NO SUGGESTION IN ABRAMOWITZ
TESTIMONY, OR IN OFFICIAL QUARTERS MONDAY, THAT US
ACTIVELY CONSIDERING MIL SALES TO PPC, NEVERTHELESS,
CONDITION PRC FORCES, AS DESCRIBED IN TESTIMONY,
INDICATES AMPLE REASONS WHY PEKING MIGHT WANT BY US

COMMENT AND ANALYSIS

9.   KOREA

CSM'S SOUTHERLAND, IN HK, VIEWS RECENT SK CRACKDOWN
AS SIGN PRES PARK RESIGNED 'GOING IT ALONE.&quot;  CITES
W DIPLOMATS WHO SAY PARK BELIEVES US SUPPORT 'WILL
DECLINE DRAMATICALLY&quot; WITHIN NEXT FEW YEARS, NO MATTER
WHAT HE DOES, BUT AFTER RECENT VN DEFEAT US DOES NOT
DARE WITHDRAW TROOPS IMMEDIATELY.  NOTES PARK SAID
SKEPTICAL OF US 'STAYING POWER,' FEARS TOLERANCE 'EVEN
MILDEST DISSENT&quot; WOULD BE SEEN BY OPPONENTS AS SIGN
WEAKNESS.  STATES W EXPERTS, LIKE COLUMBIA'S BRZEZINSKI,
CONVINCED US CAN DO LITTLE DISSUADE PARK FROM TAKING
HARD-LINE AGAINST NON-COMMUNIST OPPONENTS.  SAYS DOS
FEELS WITHDRAWAL OF TROOPS 'AT THIS TIME' WOULD HAVE
'DESTABILIZING; EFFECT IN KOREA.  ADDS WOULD HAVE
BEEN UPROAR IN NEIGHBORING JAPAN IF KIM DAE JUNG ARRESTED
TWO YEARS AGO, AND JAPANESE PRESSURE FOR HIS RELEASE.

10.  CHINA

AP (CSM) REPORTS MANSFIELD SAID ;ONDAY HE AGREES WITH
SCHLESINGER'S VIEW THAT US SHOULD NOT REJECT, 'OUT
OF HAND,&quot; MIL AID TO PRC.  DECLARED CONGRESS NEVER
TOLD ANY CONSIDERATION BEING GIVEN THIS, AND SAID HE
DOUBTS CHINESE     WERE ADVISED.  SEN CONTENDED US
SHOULD DEAL EQUALLY WITH PRC, SOVIET, AND SAID HE
SUPPORTS GRANTING PEKING MFN SATUS IN TRADE RELATIONS.

KRAFT (WP, SUN) FEELS PRC SUCCESSION CRISIS MEANS PRC
ROLE ON WORLD STAGE WILL NOW BE EVEN LESS IMPORTANT,
SO US MUST RETHINK WAY IN WHICH IT WILL PLAY THREE-
CORNERED GAME WITH PEKING, MOSCOW.  CHINESE CAN NO
LONGER BE EXPECTED EITHER WEIGH IN SO HEAVILY IN
DIRECT PRESSURE ON SOVIET, OR PLAY LARGE PART BALANCING
SOVIET INFLUENCE IN REST OF WORLD.  MAINTAINS
CLEAR FOR WEEKS THAT PEKING PULLING IN HORNS IN
CAMBODIA, ANGOLA, TANZANIA, CUBA, WHERE USED TO

CONTEST SOVIET PRESSURE.

ACCORDING KRAFT, IF SOVIET TO BE CONTAINED, US AND
ALLIES MUST UNDERTAKE MORE ACTIVE POLICY;
WASHINGTON, PARTICULARLY, OUGHT TO BE DEVELOPING MUCH
BETTER RELS WITH UNDERDEVELOPED COUNTRIES OF ASIA,
AFRICA, LA, WHERE SOVIET SEEMS NOW CONCENTRATING
EFFORTS.  EQUALLY IMPORTANT IS ROLE OF US ALLIES --
JAPANESE, BRITS, ETC -- WHO SHOULD TURN COLD, FISHY
EYE TOWARD SOVIET PROPOSALS FOR HELP IN ADVANCED

NYT'S BUTTERFIELD (4/11), IN HK, SEES 'CAUTIOUSLY-
WORDED, BUT SOMEWHAT AMBIGUOUS&quot; SUNDAY PEOPLE'S DAILY
EDITORIAL APPEARING TO SUGGEST CAMPAIGN WILL NOT BE
IMMEDIATELY EXPANDED TO OTHER &quot;RIGHTISTS,' FOLLOWING
TENG'S FALL.  SAYS HK ANALYSTS BELIEVE EMPHASIS ON
LIMITING CRITICISM TO TENG REFLECTS SEVERE SHOCK AND
CONCERN FELT BY PEKING LEADERS OVER DAY-LONG RIOTING
APRIL 5.  AS INDICATION PRC LEADERS NOW TRYING GIVE
IMPRESSION OF UNITY, ANALYSTS NOTE THAT AMONG PROVINCIAL
OFFICIALS TAKING PART IN PRO-HUA RALLIES WERE SEVERAL
OF TENG'S CLOSE ASSOCIATES.

IN 4/10 COLUMN, BUTTERFIELD CITED INDICATIONS THAT
HUA/TENG SWITCH MIGHT NOT PROVE LASTING SOLUTION
TO MODERATE/RADICAL CONFLICT.  NOTING REPORTS OF
SHANGHAI POSTERS URGING DEATH FOR TENG, SAYS APPEARS
RADICALS THERE NOT SATISFIED THAT TENG ALLOWED RETAIN
CCP MEMBERSHIP; AT SAME TIME, NOTES REPORTS THAT
NANKING RR WORKERS HAD CHALKED SLOGANS ON TRAIN TO
PEKING DENOUNCING SHANGHAI NEWSPAPER FOR CRITICIZING
CHOU.  SAYS SOME HK ANALYSTS BELIEVE TENG'S FALL

IS THOUGHT TO GIVE HIM NATURAL TIES TO MODERATES;
AND FOLLOWING LAST WEEK'S DECISIONS, MODERATES HAVE BEEN

PLAYING MORE ACTIVE PUBLIC ROLE THAN AT ANY TIME SINCE
ANTI-RIGHTIST CAMPAIGN BEGAN.

TO WSTAR'S BRADSHER (4/9), QUESTION NOW IS WHETHER
MAO MIGHT TURN AGAINST HUA, AS AGAINST PREVIOUS PREMIERS.
SAYS HUA'S PROMOTION COULD BE TEMPORARY TACTICAL MOVE:
BECAUSE OF MAO'S 'OFT-EXHIBITED DISLIKE&quot; FOR DEPUTIES;
BECAUSE MAO MIGHT PREFER RADICAL LEFTIST AS PREMIER,
BUT FOR TIME BEING IS UNABLE FORCE ONE     OVER
MODERATE RESISTANCE.

WP'S GREENWAY, IN HK (4/10), SAYS USE OF APRIL 5 EVENTS
TO DISCREDIT TENG, JUSTIFY HIS REMOVAL, MAY BE NECESSARY,
AS THERE MAY BE CONSIDERABLE PRO-TENG SENTIMENT IN
PROVINCES.  BUT WHAT INTRIGUES HK ANALYSTS IS HOW MUCH
CHINESE ARE REVEALING ABOUT ANTI-MAOIST SENTIMENTS
EXPRESSED IN TIENANMEN DEMONSTRATION.  THAT TENG ALLOWED
RETAIN CCP MEMBERSHIP MAY MEAN RADICAL CASE AGAINST
HIM WAS NOT STRONG ENOUGH TO PUT HIM QUITE IN SAME CLASS
WITH LIU, LIN.  POINTS OUT HUA BECOMES FIRST CLEAR/
UNDISPUTED HEIR TO MAO SINCE LIN--AND NOT EVEN CHOU
WAS GIVEN TITLE OF FIRST VICE CHAIRMAN.  BUT CONCLUDES
THAT IF HUA REPRESENTS LEFT/RIGHT COMPROMISE, IS
QUESTIONABLE WHETHER HE WILL BE ABLE WIELD SAME POWER/
AUTHORITY AS DID CHOU, OR EVEN TENG.

NYT'S LELYVELD (4/12) CITES BUSH'S REACTIONS TO HUA/
TENG CHANGE, THAT UNLIKELY AFFECT  SINO-US RELATIONS.
BUT NOTES WHAT BUSH DID NOT SAY: THAT AFTER MORE THAN
YEAR AT USLO, NEITHER HE NOR ANY OF HIS MISSION HAD
EVER EXCHANGED WORD  WITH HUA; AND  AFTER NINE
PEKING VISITS, HAK ALSO HAS NOT MET NEW MAN.  FINDS IT
'FAIRLY SODDEN WITH IRONY' THAT ADMIN ASSURANCES ABOUT
FUTURE OF FRAGILE SINO-US RELATIONSHIP COMES FROM
NIXON TALKS WITH HUA.  MAINTAINS WHATEVER ASSURANCES
NIXON CONVEYED, LAST WEEK'S PRC EVENTS COULD NOT FAIL
INDUCE MOROSE REFLECTIONS AMONG CHINA SPECIALISTS WHO
BELIEVE US SQUANDERED OPPORTUNITY SECURE MOST

SIGNIFICANT ADVANCE IN FORPOLICY RELS IN RECENT YEARS:
OPENING TO PRC THAT NIXON/ HAK PIONEERED IN 1972.  SAYS
US VIEWS AS NIGHTMARE POSSIBILITY THAT POST-MAO PRC
COULD CEMENT RELS WITH SOVIET, BUT PRESUMABLY 1977
WILL BE WELL-ADVANCED BEFORE US MANAGES FOCUS AGAIN ON
PRC RELS IN ANY DECISIVE WAY.  IN WEEK THAT AHPEARED
TO HAVE SEEN ANTI-MAO PROTESTS IN VERY HEART OF PEKING,
FUTURE CAN HARDLY BE CALLED SURE THING.

HARVARD U'S POLLACK (NYT 4/12) CITES PEKING'S 'NUCLEAR
RESTRAINT': HAS NOT USED ATOMIC BLACKMAIL AGAINST NON-
NUKE STATES; HAS NOT TRANSFERRED NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY
OR FISSIONABLE MATERIAL TO OTHER COUNTRIES, HAS
CONSISTENTLY SOUGHT LIMIT CONTINGENCIES UNDER WHICH
MIGHT USE SUCH WEAPONS.  SEES THESE FINDINGS RAISING
SERIOUS DOUBTS ABOUT ANY  INCIPIENT TRIANGULARITY
IN STRATEGIC RELS AMONG US, PRC, SOVIET.

WP'S KARNOW (4/11) REVIEWS LUCIAN PYE'S PSYCHOLOGICAL
EXAMINATION  OF MAO, &quot;MAO TSE-TUNG:  THE MAN IN THE

CITES PYE VIEW THAT MAO ABANDONED ASSOCIATES BECAUSE,
AT EARLY AGE, HE FELT ABANDONED      BY HIS OWN MOTHER,
WHEN SHE DIED LEAVING HIM UNPROTECTED IN DOMESTIC
DISPUTES WITH HIS FATHER, WHO WAS HARSH DISCIPLINARIAN.
PYE MAINTAINS THAT AS RESULT, MAO PROTECTED EMOTIONS
AFTERWARD WITH CLOAK OF IMPERSONALITY.  KARNOW FEELS
PYE MAKES FASCINATING CASE FOR HIS THEORY.

UCLA PROF BAUM (LAT 4/11) SAYS ALTHOUGH TENG HIGHEST-
RANKING CASUALTY OF CURRENT ANTI-RIGHTIST CAMPAIGN,
NOW APPEARS ULTIMATE TARGET MAY ACTUALLY BE CHOU'S
GHOST.  FINDS EVEN MORE SURPRISING THAN TENG'S ABRUPT
DISMISSAL WAS MANNER IN WHICH IT OCCURRED: POLITBURO
CLEARLY VIOLATED STATE CONSTITUTION BY ACTING WITHOUT
CONVENING NPC OR CENTRAL CMTE; EVEN MORE STARTLING
WAS OFFICIAL ANNOUNCEMENT THAT DECISION OUSTING TENG
WAS TAKEN BY POLITBURO UNANIMOUS AGREEMENT -- CLAIM,
WHICH IF TRUE, SUGGESTS TENG, HIMSELF, MAY HAVE CONCURRED
IN OWN DISMISSAL.  BUT TENG'S DEPARTURE BY NO MEANS
UNMITIGATED DISASTER FOR MODERATES, SINCE FAR FROM
UNCLASSIFIED

PAGE 09  STATE  088917

CLEAR THAT HUA IS RADICAL, AND LI HSIEN-NIEN HAS REAPPEARED
PUBLICLY.  YET HIGHLY UNLIKELY SUCCESSION CRISIS
FINALLY, DEFINITELY RESOLVED.

CDN'S BEECH, IN HK (4/9) SAYS OUTLOOK FOR PRC IS
CONTINUING TURMOIL, WITH MORE HEADS TO ROLL BEFORE
POLITICAL BLOODLETTING COMES TO END.  HUA'S BECOMING
PREMIER IS 'FATE WORSE THAN DEATH,' IF CASUALTY RATE
AMONG  OTHER MOA HEIRS IS CRITERION.  OBSERVES
LEFTISTS FIND READY SYMPATHIZER IN MAO, YET THERE IS
LIMIT TO HOW FAR CAN PUSH HIM, SINCE CHAIRMAN DOESN'T
WANT DISRUPT COUNTRY'S ECON PROGRESS, KNOWS FRATRICIDAL
POWER STRUGGLE COULD BE FATAL, WITH SOVIET THREAT
HANGING OVER PEKING'S HEAD.  BUT TO GET POWER THEY
WANT, LEFTISTS CANNOT STOP WITH TENG OUSTER, SO
PROBABILITY IS THEIR CAMPAIGN WILL BE BROADENED, NOT
NARROWED.

CDN (4/9) SEES CONFUSING PRC PICTURE OFFERING US
LITTLE GUIDANCE IN DELICATE, TRIANGULAR RELATIONSHIP
WITH CHINESE, SOVIET.  NOTES SINO-US 'NORMALIZATION'
EFFORTS HAVE GAINED LITTLE SO FAR, AND EXPERIENCE
OF OTHER WESTERN NATIONS THAT HAVE RECOGNIZED PEKING
HAS BEEN NO BETTER.  ABOUT ALL US CAN DO IS WATCH,
WAIT, IN HOPE PRC WILL BE SPARED ANOTHER REVOLUTION,
AND THAT STABLE GOVT WILL EMERGE WITH WHICH WE CAN
DEAL ON SENSIBLE GROUNDS.

CHI S-T (4/7) SUGGESTS IF US TO DEAL EFFECTIVELY WITH
PRC CHANGES HINTED AT BY APR 5 RIOTS, MUST BE FAMALIAR
AS CAN BE WITH CHINESE LEADERS,  ACTUAL AND POTENTIAL.
MAINTAINS THIS MEANS REHABILITATION OF SINO-US DIPLOMATIC
RELS MUST REMAIN IMPORTANT, EVEN DOMINANT, ELEMENT IN
US ASIA POLICY.

DINNER HELD BY HARVARD BUSINESS SCHOOL CLUB OF NY, REPLYING
TO QUESTIONS, SAID HE DOES NOT EXPECT CURRENT PRC FACTIONAL
UNREST WILL EFFECT ANY CHANGE OF DIRECTION IN PEKING'S
RELATIONS WITH US, OR SOVIET.  ADDED THAT PRC HAD NO
INTENTION INTERFERRING IN INTERNAL US POLITICS BY INVITING
NIXON; SAID CHINESE JUST DON'T THINK THAT WAY, AND NOTED

WEEK AGO THAT PRC HAS NE' MISSILE THAT COULD STRIKE TARGETS

SOME 10-20 YEARS BEHIND TIMES.  ABRAMOWITZ DECLARED PRC
SELF-RELIANCE POLICY HAS PEEN &quot;POWERFUL POLITICAL AND
ECONOMIC TOOL,&quot; BUT WILL BE INSUFFICIENT TO MODERNIZE HER
ARMED FORCES, SO PEKING MUST TURN APROAD FOR MORE
SOPHISTICATED WEAPONS OF TODAY.  ADDED THAT PEKING HAS NOT

REQUESTED US MIL AID, THOUGH HAS SOUGHT CERTAIN US
HIGH-TECHNOLOGY EQUIPMENT; ALSO SATD THERE IS EVIDENCE
OF UPTURN IN CHINESE MIL SPENDING IN PAST YEAR AFTER

ACCORDING ABRAMOWITZ, TWO-THIRDS PLA, HALF AIR FORCE,
ARE DEPLOYED TO DEFEND N, NE PART OF COUNTRY, AND ON
THEIR SIDE SOVIETS HAVE DEPLOYED FORCES EXCEEDING WHAT
WOULD BE NEEDED TO STOP CHINESE ATTACK.  SAID THIS
NECESSITY FOR PRC DEFENSE, LIMITING CHINESE AND SOVIET
OPTIONS, HAS BEEN MAJOR FACTOR IN MUTING PEKING'S
HOSTILITY TO US MIL PRESENCE IN ASIA.

CORDDRY OBSERVES WHILE NO SUGGESTION IN ABRAMOWITZ

ANTI-RIGHTIST CAMPAIGN BEGAN.

TO WSTAR'S BRADSHER (4/9), QUESTION NOW IS WHETHER
MAO MIGHT TURN AGAINST HUA, AS AGAINST PREVIOUS PREMIERS.
SAYS HUA'S PROMOTION COULD BE TEMPORARY TACTICAL MOVE:
BECAUSE OF MAO'S 'OFT-EXHIBITED DISLIKE&quot; FOR DEPUTIES;
BECAUSE MAO MIGHT PREFER RADICAL LEFTIST AS PREMIER,
BUT FOR TIME BEING IS UNABLE FORCE ONE     OVER
MODERATE RESISTANCE.

WP'S GREENWAY, IN HK (4/10), SAYS USE OF APRIL 5 EVENTS
TO DISCREDIT TENG, JUSTIFY HIS REMOVAL, MAY BE NECESSARY,
AS THERE MAY BE CONSIDERABLE PRO-TENG SENTIMENT IN
PROVINCES.  BUT WHAT INTRIGUES HK ANALYSTS IS HOW MUCH
CHINESE ARE REVEALING ABOUT ANTI-MAOIST SENTIMENTS
EXPRESSED IN TIENANMEN DEMONSTRATION.  THAT TENG ALLOWED
RETAIN CCP MEMBERSHIP MAY MEAN RADICAL CASE AGAINST
HIM WAS NOT STRONG ENOUGH TO PUT HIM QUITE IN SAME CLASS
WITH LIU, LIN.  POINTS OUT HUA BECOMES FIRST CLEAR/
UNDISPUTED HEIR TO MAO SINCE LIN--AND NOT EVEN CHOU
WAS GIVEN TITLE OF FIRST VICE CHAIRMAN.  BUT CONCLUDES
THAT IF HUA REPRESENTS LEFT/RIGHT COMPROMISE, IS
QUESTIONABLE WHETHER HE WILL BE ABLE WIELD SAME POWER/
AUTHORITY AS DID CHOU, OR EVEN TENG.

NYT'S LELYVELD (4/12) CITES BUSH'S REACTIONS TO HUA/
TENG CHANGE, THAT UNLIKELY AFFECT  SINO-US RELATIONS.
BUT NOTES WHAT BUSH DID NOT SAY: THAT AFTER MORE THAN
YEAR AT USLO, NEITHER HE NOR ANY OF HIS MISSION HAD
EVER EXCHANGED WORD  WITH HUA; AND  AFTER NINE
PEKING VISITS, HAK ALSO HAS NOT MET NEW MAN.  FINDS IT
'FAIRLY SODDEN WITH IRONY' THAT ADMIN ASSURANCES ABOUT
FUTURE OF FRAGILE SINO-US RELATIONSHIP COMES FROM
NIXON TALKS WITH HUA.  MAINTAINS WHATEVER ASSURANCES
NIXON CONVEYED, LAST WEEK'S PRC EVENTS COULD NOT FAIL
INDUCE MOROSE REFLECTIONS AMONG CHINA SPECIALISTS WHO
BELIEVE US SQUANDERED OPPORTUNITY SECURE MOST
UNCLASSIFIED

PAGE 08  STATE  088917

SIGNIFICANT ADVANCE IN FORPOLICY RELS IN RECENT YEARS:
OPENING TO PRC THAT NIXON/ HAK PIONEERED IN 1972.  SAYS
US VIEWS AS NIGHTMARE POSSIBILITY THAT POST-MAO PRC
COULD CEMENT RELS WITH SOVIET, BUT PRESUMABLY 1977
WILL BE WELL-ADVANCED BEFORE US MANAGES FOCUS AGAIN ON
PRC RELS IN ANY DECISIVE WAY.  IN WEEK THAT AHPEARED
TO HAVE SEEN ANTI-MAO PROTESTS IN VERY HEART OF PEKING,
FUTURE CAN HARDLY BE CALLED SURE THING.

HARVARD U'S POLLACK (NYT 4/12) CITES PEKING'S 'NUCLEAR
RESTRAINT': HAS NOT USED ATOMIC BLACKMAIL AGAINST NON-
NUKE STATES; HAS NOT TRANSFERRED NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY
OR FISSIONABLE MATERIAL TO OTHER COUNTRIES, HAS
CONSISTENTLY SOUGHT LIMIT CONTINGENCIES UNDER WHICH
MIGHT USE SUCH WEAPONS.  SEES THESE FINDINGS RAISING
SERIOUS DOUBTS ABOUT ANY  INCIPIENT TRIANGULARITY
IN STRATEGIC RELS AMONG US, PRC, SOVIET.

WP'S KARNOW (4/11) REVIEWS LUCIAN PYE'S PSYCHOLOGICAL
EXAMINATION  OF MAO, &quot;MAO TSE-TUNG:  THE MAN IN THE
LEADER.&quot;  SAYS BOOK IS, IN MANY WAYS, TOUR DE FORCE.
CITES PYE VIEW THAT MAO ABANDONED ASSOCIATES BECAUSE,
AT EARLY AGE, HE FELT ABANDONED      BY HIS OWN MOTHER,
WHEN SHE DIED LEAVING HIM UNPROTECTED IN DOMESTIC
DISPUTES WITH HIS FATHER, WHO WAS HARSH DISCIPLINARIAN.
PYE MAINTAINS THAT AS RESULT, MAO PROTECTED EMOTIONS
AFTERWARD WITH CLOAK OF IMPERSONALITY.  KARNOW FEELS
PYE MAKES FASCINATING CASE FOR HIS THEORY.

UCLA PROF BAUM (LAT 4/11) SAYS ALTHOUGH TENG HIGHEST-
RANKING CASUALTY OF CURRENT ANTI-RIGHTIST CAMPAIGN,
NOW APPEARS ULTIMATE TARGET MAY ACTUALLY BE CHOU'S
GHOST.  FINDS EVEN MORE SURPRISING THAN TENG'S ABRUPT
DISMISSAL WAS MANNER IN WHICH IT OCCURRED: POLITBURO
CLEARLY VIOLATED STATE CONSTITUTION BY ACTING WITHOUT
CONVENING NPC OR CENTRAL CMTE; EVEN MORE STARTLING
WAS OFFICIAL ANNOUNCEMENT THAT DECISION OUSTING TENG
WAS TAKEN BY POLITBURO UNANIMOUS AGREEMENT -- CLAIM,
WHICH IF TRUE, SUGGESTS TENG, HIMSELF, MAY HAVE CONCURRED
IN OWN DISMISSAL.  BUT TENG'S DEPARTURE BY NO MEANS
UNMITIGATED DISASTER FOR MODERATES, SINCE FAR FROM
UNCLASSIFIED

PAGE 09  STATE  088917

CLEAR THAT HUA IS RADICAL, AND LI HSIEN-NIEN HAS REAPPEARED
PUBLICLY.  YET HIGHLY UNLIKELY SUCCESSION CRISIS
FINALLY, DEFINITELY RESOLVED.

CDN'S BEECH, IN HK (4/9) SAYS OUTLOOK FOR PRC IS
CONTINUING TURMOIL, WITH MORE HEADS TO ROLL BEFORE
POLITICAL BLOODLETTING COMES TO END.  HUA'S BECOMING
PREMIER IS 'FATE WORSE THAN DEATH,' IF CASUALTY RATE
AMONG  OTHER MOA HEIRS IS CRITERION.  OBSERVES
LEFTISTS FIND READY SYMPATHIZER IN MAO, YET THERE IS
LIMIT TO HOW FAR CAN PUSH HIM, SINCE CHAIRMAN DOESN'T
WANT DISRUPT COUNTRY'S ECON PROGRESS, KNOWS FRATRICIDAL
POWER STRUGGLE COULD BE FATAL, WITH SOVIET THREAT
HANGING OVER PEKING'S HEAD.  BUT TO GET POWER THEY
WANT, LEFTISTS CANNOT STOP WITH TENG OUSTER, SO
PROBABILITY IS THEIR CAMPAIGN WILL BE BROADENED, NOT
NARROWED.

CDN (4/9) SEES CONFUSING PRC PICTURE OFFERING US
LITTLE GUIDANCE IN DELICATE, TRIANGULAR RELATIONSHIP
WITH CHINESE, SOVIET.  NOTES SINO-US 'NORMALIZATION'
EFFORTS HAVE GAINED LITTLE SO FAR, AND EXPERIENCE
OF OTHER WESTERN NATIONS THAT HAVE RECOGNIZED PEKING
HAS BEEN NO BETTER.  ABOUT ALL US CAN DO IS WATCH,
WAIT, IN HOPE PRC WILL BE SPARED ANOTHER REVOLUTION,
AND THAT STABLE GOVT WILL EMERGE WITH WHICH WE CAN
DEAL ON SENSIBLE GROUNDS.

CHI S-T (4/7) SUGGESTS IF US TO DEAL EFFECTIVELY WITH
PRC CHANGES HINTED AT BY APR 5 RIOTS, MUST BE FAMALIAR
AS CAN BE WITH CHINESE LEADERS,  ACTUAL AND POTENTIAL.
MAINTAINS THIS MEANS REHABILITATION OF SINO-US DIPLOMATIC
RELS MUST REMAIN IMPORTANT, EVEN DOMINANT, ELEMENT IN
US ASIA POLICY.

SUN'S SEIDEN,  IN TOKYO, SAYS IN MAJOR EXHIBIT
ARCHAEOLOGICAL ARTIFACTS NEVER  BEFORE SEEN OUTSIDE
PRC, PEKING IS TREATING TOKYO TO RARE DISPLAY OF
GLORY THAT WAS &quot;MIDDLE KINGDOM' EARLY AS 1,600 YEAFS

GAP BETWEEN ELITE, MASSES; REVIEWS THAI HISTORY OF
