		<h3>Tor</h3>
		<p><a href="https://www.torproject.org">Tor</a> is an encrypted anonymising network that makes it harder to intercept internet communications, or see where communications are coming from or going to.</p>
		<p>In order to use the WikiLeaks public submission system as detailed above you can download the Tor Browser Bundle, which is a Firefox-like browser available for Windows, Mac OS X and GNU/Linux and pre-configured to connect using the anonymising system Tor.</p>
		<h4>Tails</h4>
		<p>If you are at high risk and you have the capacity to do so, you can also access the submission system through a secure operating system called <a href="https://tails.boum.org">Tails</a>. Tails is an operating system launched from a USB stick or a DVD that aim to leaves no traces when the computer is shut down after use and automatically routes your internet traffic through Tor. Tails will require you to have either a USB stick or a DVD at least 4GB big and a laptop or desktop computer.</p>

		<h3>Tips</h3>
		<p>Our submission system works hard to preserve your anonymity, but we recommend you also take some of your own precautions. Please review these basic guidelines. </p>
		<div>
			<h4>1. Contact us if you have specific problems</h4>
			<p>If you have a very large submission, or a submission with a complex format, or are a high-risk source, please <a href="#submit_help_contact">contact us</a>. In our experience it is always possible to find a custom solution for even the most seemingly difficult situations.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h4>2. What computer to use</h4>
			<p>If the computer you are uploading from could subsequently be audited in an investigation, consider using a computer that is not easily tied to you. Technical users can also use <a href="https://tails.boum.org">Tails</a> to help ensure you do not leave any records of your submission on the computer.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h4>3. Do not talk about your submission to others</h4>
			<p>If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in source protection – it is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This includes other media organisations.</p>
		</div>

	</div>
</div>

<div id="submit_help_after" class="submit_elem">

			</div>
		</div>

		<h3>After</h3>

		<div>
			<h4>1. Do not talk about your submission to others</h4>
			<p>If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in source protection – it is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This includes other media organisations.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h4>2. Act normal</h4>
			<p>If you are a high-risk source, avoid saying anything or doing anything after submitting which might promote suspicion. In particular, you should try to stick to your normal routine and behaviour.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h4>3. Remove traces of your submission</h4>
			<p>If you are a high-risk source and the computer you prepared your submission on, or uploaded it from, could subsequently be audited in an investigation, we recommend that you format and dispose of the computer hard drive and any other storage media you used.</p>
			<p>In particular, hard drives retain data after formatting which may be visible to a digital forensics team and flash media (USB sticks, memory cards and SSD drives) retain data even after a secure erasure. If you used flash media to store sensitive data, it is important to destroy the media.</p>
			<p>If you do this and are a high-risk source you should make sure there are no traces of the clean-up, since such traces themselves may draw suspicion.</p>
			<div>
				<h4>4. If you face legal action</h4>
				<p>If a legal action is brought against you as a result of your submission, there are organisations that may help you. The Courage Foundation is an international organisation dedicated to the protection of journalistic sources. You can find more details at <a href="https://www.couragefound.org">https://www.couragefound.org</a>.</p>

		<p>WikiLeaks publishes documents of political or historical importance that are censored or otherwise suppressed. We specialise in strategic global publishing and large archives.</p>
		<p>The following is the address of our secure site where you can anonymously upload your documents to WikiLeaks editors. You can only access this submissions system through Tor. (See our <a href="#submit_help_tor">Tor tab</a> for more information.) We also advise you to read our <a href="#submit_help_tips">tips for sources</a> before submitting.</p>

<h1 style="display: none">The Global Intelligence Files</h1>
   <p>On Monday February 27th, 2012, WikiLeaks began publishing <i>The Global Intelligence Files</i>, over five million e-mails from the Texas headquartered  "global intelligence" company Stratfor. The e-mails date between July  2004 and late December 2011. They reveal the inner workings of a company  that fronts as an intelligence publisher, but provides confidential  intelligence services to large corporations, such as Bhopal's Dow  Chemical Co., Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, Raytheon and government  agencies, including the US Department of Homeland Security, the US  Marines and the US Defence Intelligence Agency. The emails show  Stratfor's web of informers, pay-off structure, payment laundering techniques and psychological methods.</p>

                                                             By George Friedman <br />
  Sometimes when I read a newspaper article, it strikes me as a &quot;He said, she   <br />
  said&quot; game. If I'm going to make an informed decision, I need analysis - not  <br />
  opinions from two sides, each with their own motive. You can find quotes      <br />
  from &quot;experts&quot; anywhere, but they usually don't offer much insight, except    <br />
  into the agenda of the person quoted. For deeper insight, I turn to my        <br />
  friend George Friedman at STRATFOR. STRATFOR publishes intelligence, not      <br />
  news. No journalists, no politicians - just analysts.                         <br />
                                                                                <br />
  I'm sending you a peek at the type of intelligence they provide for           <br />
  decision-makers like you and me. Enjoy the read, notice the difference and    <br />

   A Defensive Buildup in the Gulf                                              <br />
   By George Friedman                                                           <br />
                                                                                <br />
   This weekend's newspapers were filled with stories about how the United      <br />
   States is providing ballistic missile defense (BMD) to four countries on     <br />
   the Arabian Peninsula. The New York Times carried a front-page story on      <br />
   the United States providing anti-missile defenses to Kuwait, the United      <br />
   Arab Emirates, Qatar and Oman, as well as stationing BMD-capable,            <br />
   Aegis-equipped warships in the Persian Gulf. Meanwhile, the front page of    <br />
   The Washington Post carried a story saying that &quot;the Obama administration    <br />
   is quietly working with Saudi Arabia and other Persian Gulf allies to        <br />
   speed up arms sales and rapidly upgrade defenses for oil terminals and       <br />
   other key infrastructure in a bid to thwart future attacks by Iran,          <br />
   according to former and current U.S. and Middle Eastern government           <br />
   officials.&quot;                                                                  <br />
                                                                                <br />
   Obviously, the work is no longer &quot;quiet.&quot; In fact, Washington has been       <br />
   publicly engaged in upgrading defensive systems in the area for some time.   <br />
   Central Command head Gen. David Petraeus recently said the four countries    <br />
   named by the Times were receiving BMD-capable Patriot Advanced               <br />
   Capability-3 (PAC-3) batteries, and at the end of October the United         <br />
   States carried out its largest-ever military exercises with Israel, known    <br />
   as Juniper Cobra.                                                            <br />
                                                                                <br />
   More interesting than the stories themselves was the Obama                   <br />
   administration's decision to launch a major public relations campaign this   <br />
   weekend regarding these moves. And the most intriguing question out of all   <br />
   this is why the administration decided to call everyone's attention to       <br />
   these defensive measures while not mentioning any offensive options.         <br />
                                                                                <br />
     The Iranian Nuclear Question                                               <br />
                                                                                <br />
   U.S. President Barack Obama spent little time on foreign policy in his       <br />
   Jan. 27 State of the Union message, though he did make a short, sharp        <br />
   reference to Iran. He promised a strong response to Tehran if it continued   <br />
   its present course; though this could have been pro forma, it seemed quite   <br />
   pointed. Early in his administration, Obama had said he would give the       <br />
   Iranians until the end of 2009 to change their policy on nuclear weapons     <br />
   development. But the end of 2009 came, and the Iranians continued their      <br />
   policy.                                                                      <br />
                                                                                <br />
   All along, Obama has focused on diplomacy on the Iran question. To be more   <br />
   precise, he has focused on bringing together a coalition prepared to         <br />
   impose &quot;crippling sanctions&quot; on the Iranians. The most crippling sanction    <br />
   would be stopping Iran's gasoline imports, as Tehran imports about 35        <br />
   percent of its gasoline. Such sanctions are now unlikely, as China has       <br />
   made clear that it is not prepared to participate a** and that was before    <br />
   the most recent round of U.S. weapon sales to Taiwan. Similarly, while the   <br />
   Russians have indicated that their participation in sanctions is not         <br />
   completely out of the question, they also have made clear that time for      <br />
   sanctions is not near. We suspect that the Russian time frame for            <br />
   sanctions will keep getting pushed back.                                     <br />
                                                                                <br />
   Therefore, the diplomatic option appears to have dissolved. The Israelis     <br />
   have said they regard February as the decisive month for sanctions, which    <br />
   they have indicated is based on an agreement with the United States. While   <br />
   previous deadlines of various sorts regarding Iran have come and gone,       <br />
   there is really no room after February. If no progress is made on            <br />
   sanctions and no action follows, then the decision has been made by          <br />
   default that a nuclear-armed Iran is acceptable.                             <br />
                                                                                <br />
   The Americans and the Israelis have somewhat different views of this based   <br />
   on different geopolitical realities. The Americans have seen a number of     <br />
   apparently extreme and dangerous countries develop nuclear weapons. The      <br />
   most important example was Maoist China. Mao Zedong had argued that a        <br />
   nuclear war was not particularly dangerous to China, as it could lose        <br />
   several hundred million people and still win the war. But once China         <br />
   developed nuclear weapons, the wild talk subsided and China behaved quite    <br />
   cautiously. From this experience, the United States developed a two-stage    <br />
   strategy.                                                                    <br />
                                                                                <br />
   First, the United States believed that while the spread of nuclear weapons   <br />
   is a danger, countries tend to be circumspect after acquiring nuclear        <br />
   weapons. Therefore, overreaction by United States to the acquisition of      <br />
   nuclear weapons by other countries is unnecessary and unwise.                <br />
                                                                                <br />
   Second, since the United States is a big country with widely dispersed       <br />
   population and a massive nuclear arsenal, a reckless country that launched   <br />
   some weapons at the United States would do minimal harm to the United        <br />
   States while the other country would face annihilation. And the United       <br />
   States has emphasized BMD to further mitigate a** if not eliminate a** the   <br />
   threat of such a limited strike to the United States.                        <br />
                                                                                <br />
   Israel's geography forces it to see things differently. Iranian President    <br />
   Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has said Israel should be wiped off the face of the      <br />
   Earth while simultaneously working to attain nuclear weapons. While the      <br />
   Americans take comfort in the view that the acquisition of nuclear weapons   <br />
   has a sobering effect on a new nuclear power, the Israelis don't think the   <br />
   Chinese case necessarily can be generalized. Moreover, the United States     <br />
   is outside the range of the Iranians' current ballistic missile arsenal      <br />
   while Israel is not. And a nuclear strike would have a particularly          <br />
   devastating effect on Israel. Unlike the United States, Israel is small      <br />
   country with a highly concentrated population. A strike with just one or     <br />
   two weapons could destroy Israel.                                            <br />
                                                                                <br />
   Therefore, Israel has a very different threshold for risk as far as Iran     <br />
   is concerned. For Israel, a nuclear strike from Iran is improbable, but      <br />
   would be catastrophic if it happened. For the United States, the risk of     <br />
   an Iranian strike is far more remote, and would be painful but not           <br />
   catastrophic if it happened. The two countries thus approach the situation   <br />
   very differently.                                                            <br />
                                                                                <br />
   How close the Iranians are to having a deliverable nuclear weapon is, of     <br />
   course, a significant consideration in all this. Iran has not yet achieved   <br />
   a testable nuclear device. Logic tells us they are quite far from a          <br />
   deliverable nuclear weapon. But the ability to trust logic varies as the     <br />
   risk grows. The United States (and this is true for both the Bush and        <br />
   Obama administrations) has been much more willing to play for time than      <br />
   Israel can afford to be. For Israel, all intelligence must be read in the    <br />
   context of worst-case scenarios.                                             <br />
                                                                                <br />
     Diverging Interests and Grand Strategy                                     <br />
                                                                                <br />
   It is also important to remember that Israel is much less dependent on the   <br />
   United States than it was in 1973. Though U.S. aid to Israel continues, it   <br />
   is now a much smaller percentage of Israeli gross domestic product.          <br />
   Moreover, the threat of sudden conventional attack by Israel's immediate     <br />
   neighbors has disappeared. Egypt is at peace with Israel, and in any case,   <br />
   its military is too weak to mount an attack. Jordan is effectively an        <br />
   Israeli ally. Only Syria is hostile, but it presents no conventional         <br />
   military threat. Israel previously has relied on guarantees that the         <br />
   United States would rush aid to Israel in the event of war. But it has       <br />
   been a generation since this has been a major consideration for Israel. In   <br />
   the minds of many, the Israeli-U.S. relationship is stuck in the past.       <br />
   Israel is not critical to American interests the way it was during the       <br />
   Cold War. And Israel does not need the United States the way it did during   <br />
   the Cold War. While there is intelligence cooperation in the struggle        <br />
   against jihadists, even here American and Israeli interests diverge.         <br />
                                                                                <br />
   And this means that the United States no longer has Israeli national         <br />
   security as an overriding consideration a** and that the United States       <br />
   cannot compel Israel to pursue policies Israel regards as dangerous.         <br />
                                                                                <br />
   Given all of this, the Obama administration's decision to launch a public    <br />
   relations campaign on defensive measures just before February makes          <br />
   perfect sense. If Iran develops a nuclear capability, a defensive            <br />
   capability might shift Iran's calculus of the risks and rewards of the       <br />
   military option.                                                             <br />
                                                                                <br />
   Assume, for example, that the Iranians decided to launch a nuclear missile   <br />
   at Israel or Iran's Arab neighbors with which its relations are not the      <br />
   best. Iran would have only a handful of missiles, and perhaps just one.      <br />
   Launching that one missile only to have it shot down would represent the     <br />
   worst-case scenario for Iran. Tehran would have lost a valuable military     <br />
   asset, it would not have achieved its goal and it would have invited a       <br />
   devastating counterstrike. Anything the United States can do to increase     <br />
   the likelihood of an Iranian failure therefore decreases the likelihood      <br />
   that Iran would strike until they have more delivery systems and more        <br />
   fissile material for manufacturing more weapons.                             <br />
                                                                                <br />
   The U.S. announcement of the defensive measures therefore has three          <br />
   audiences: Iran, Israel and the American public. Israel and Iran obviously   <br />
   know all about American efforts, meaning the key audience is the American    <br />
   public. The administration is trying to deflect American concerns about      <br />
   Iran generated both by reality and Israel by showing that effective steps    <br />
   are being taken.                                                             <br />
                                                                                <br />
   There are two key weapon systems being deployed, the PAC-3 and the           <br />
   Aegis/Standard Missile-3 (SM-3). The original Patriot, primarily an          <br />
   anti-aircraft system, had a poor record a** especially as a BMD system a**   <br />
   during the first Gulf War. But that was almost 20 years ago. The new         <br />
   system is regarded as much more effective as a terminal-phase BMD system,    <br />
   such as the medium-range ballistic missiles (MRBMs) developed by Iran, and   <br />
   performed much more impressively in this role during the opening of          <br />
   Operation Iraqi Freedom in March 2003. In addition, Juniper Cobra served     <br />
   to further integrate a series of American and Israeli BMD interceptors and   <br />
   sensors, building a more redundant and layered system. This operation also   <br />
   included the SM-3, which is deployed aboard specially modified               <br />
   Aegis-equipped guided missile cruisers and destroyers. The SM-3 is one of    <br />
   the most successful BMD technologies currently in the field and              <br />
   successfully brought down a wayward U.S. spy satellite in 2008.              <br />
                                                                                <br />
   Nevertheless, a series of Iranian Shahab-3s is a different threat than a     <br />
   few Iraqi Scuds, and the PAC-3 and SM-3 have yet to be proven in combat      <br />
   against such MRBMs a** something the Israelis are no doubt aware of. War     <br />
   planners must calculate the incalculable; that is what makes good generals   <br />
   pessimists.                                                                  <br />
                                                                                <br />
   The Obama administration does not want to mount an offensive action          <br />
   against Iran. Such an operation would not be a single strike like the 1981   <br />
   Osirak attack in Iraq. Iran has multiple nuclear sites buried deep and       <br />
   surrounded by air defenses. And assessing the effectiveness of airstrikes    <br />
   would be a nightmare. Many days of combat at a minimum probably would be     <br />
   required, and like the effectiveness of defensive weapons systems, the       <br />
   quality of intelligence about which locations to hit cannot be known until   <br />
   after the battle.                                                            <br />
                                                                                <br />
   A defensive posture therefore makes perfect sense for the United States.     <br />
   Washington can simply defend its allies, letting them absorb the risk and    <br />
   then the first strike before the United States counterstrikes rather than    <br />
   rely on its intelligence and offensive forces in a pre-emptive strike.       <br />
   This defensive posture on Iran fits American grand strategy, which is        <br />
   always to shift such risk to partners in exchange for technology and         <br />
   long-term guarantees.                                                        <br />
                                                                                <br />
   The Arabian states can live with this, albeit nervously, since they are      <br />
   not the likely targets. But Israel finds its assigned role in U.S. grand     <br />
   strategy far more difficult to stomach. In the unlikely event that Iran      <br />
   actually does develop a weapon and does strike, Israel is the likely         <br />
   target. If the defensive measures do not convince Iran to abandon its        <br />
   program and if the Patriots allow a missile to leak through, Israel has a    <br />
   national catastrophe. It faces an unlikely event with unacceptable           <br />
   consequences.                                                                <br />
                                                                                <br />
     Israel's Options                                                           <br />
                                                                                <br />
   It has options, although a long-range conventional airstrike against Iran    <br />
   is really not one of them. Carrying out a multiday or even multiweek air     <br />
   campaign with Israel's available force is too likely to be insufficient      <br />
   and too likely to fail. Israel's most effective option for taking out        <br />
   Iran's nuclear activities is itself nuclear. Israel could strike Iran from   <br />
   submarines if it genuinely intended to stop Iran's program.                  <br />
                                                                                <br />
   The problem with this is that much of the Iranian nuclear program is sited   <br />
   near large cities, including Tehran. Depending on the nuclear weapons used   <br />
   and their precision, any Israeli strikes could thus turn into                <br />
   city-killers. Israel is not able to live in a region where nuclear weapons   <br />
   are used in counterpopulation strikes (regardless of the actual intent       <br />
   behind launching). Mounting such a strike could unravel the careful          <br />
   balance of power Israel has created and threaten relationships it needs.     <br />
   And while Israel may not be as dependent on the United States as it once     <br />
   was, it does not want the United States completely distancing itself from    <br />
   Israel, as Washington doubtless would after an Israeli nuclear strike.       <br />
                                                                                <br />
   The Israelis want Iran's nuclear program destroyed, but they do not want     <br />
   to be the ones to try to do it. Only the United States has the force         <br />
   needed to carry out the strike conventionally. But like the Bush             <br />
   administration, the Obama administration is not confident in its ability     <br />
   to remove the Iranian program surgically. Washington is concerned that any   <br />
   air campaign would have an indeterminate outcome and would require           <br />
   extremely difficult ground operations to determine the strikes' success or   <br />
   failure. Perhaps even more complicated is the U.S. ability to manage the     <br />
   consequences, such as a potential attempt by Iran to close the Strait of     <br />
   Hormuz and Iranian meddling in already extremely delicate situations in      <br />
   Iraq and Afghanistan. As Iran does not threaten the United States, the       <br />
   United States therefore is in no hurry to initiate combat. And so the        <br />
   United States has launched a public relations campaign about defensive       <br />
   measures, hoping to affect Iranian calculations while remaining content to   <br />
   let the game play itself out.                                                <br />
                                                                                <br />
   Israel's option is to respond to the United States with its intent to go     <br />
   nuclear, something Washington does not want in a region where U.S. troops    <br />
   are fighting in countries on either side of Iran. Israel might calculate     <br />
   that its announcement would force the United States to pre-empt an Israeli   <br />
   nuclear strike with conventional strikes. But the American response to       <br />
   Israel cannot be predicted. It is therefore dangerous for a small regional   <br />
   power to try to corner a global power.                                       <br />
                                                                                <br />
   With the adoption of a defensive posture, we have now seen the U.S.          <br />
   response to the February deadline. This response closes off no U.S.          <br />
   options (the United States can always shift its strategy when intelligence   <br />
   indicates), it increases the Arabian Peninsula's dependence on the United    <br />
   States, and it possibly causes Iran to recalculate its position. Israel,     <br />
   meanwhile, finds itself in a box, because the United States calculates       <br />
   that Israel will not chance a conventional strike and fears a nuclear        <br />
   strike on Iran as much as the United States does.                            <br />
                                                                                <br />
   In the end, Obama has followed the Bush strategy on Iran a** make vague      <br />
   threats, try to build a coalition, hold Israel off with vague promises,      <br />
   protect the Arabian Peninsula, and wait a** to the letter. But along with    <br />
   this announcement, we would expect to begin to see a series of articles on   <br />
   the offensive deployment of U.S. forces, as good defensive posture           <br />
   requires a strong offensive option.                                          <br />
