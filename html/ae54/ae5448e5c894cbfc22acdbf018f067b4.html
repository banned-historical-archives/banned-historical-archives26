		<h3>Tor</h3>
		<p><a href="https://www.torproject.org">Tor</a> is an encrypted anonymising network that makes it harder to intercept internet communications, or see where communications are coming from or going to.</p>
		<p>In order to use the WikiLeaks public submission system as detailed above you can download the Tor Browser Bundle, which is a Firefox-like browser available for Windows, Mac OS X and GNU/Linux and pre-configured to connect using the anonymising system Tor.</p>
		<h4>Tails</h4>
		<p>If you are at high risk and you have the capacity to do so, you can also access the submission system through a secure operating system called <a href="https://tails.boum.org">Tails</a>. Tails is an operating system launched from a USB stick or a DVD that aim to leaves no traces when the computer is shut down after use and automatically routes your internet traffic through Tor. Tails will require you to have either a USB stick or a DVD at least 4GB big and a laptop or desktop computer.</p>

		<h3>Tips</h3>
		<p>Our submission system works hard to preserve your anonymity, but we recommend you also take some of your own precautions. Please review these basic guidelines. </p>
		<div>
			<h4>1. Contact us if you have specific problems</h4>
			<p>If you have a very large submission, or a submission with a complex format, or are a high-risk source, please <a href="#submit_help_contact">contact us</a>. In our experience it is always possible to find a custom solution for even the most seemingly difficult situations.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h4>2. What computer to use</h4>
			<p>If the computer you are uploading from could subsequently be audited in an investigation, consider using a computer that is not easily tied to you. Technical users can also use <a href="https://tails.boum.org">Tails</a> to help ensure you do not leave any records of your submission on the computer.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h4>3. Do not talk about your submission to others</h4>
			<p>If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in source protection – it is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This includes other media organisations.</p>
		</div>

	</div>
</div>

<div id="submit_help_after" class="submit_elem">

			</div>
		</div>

		<h3>After</h3>

		<div>
			<h4>1. Do not talk about your submission to others</h4>
			<p>If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in source protection – it is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This includes other media organisations.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h4>2. Act normal</h4>
			<p>If you are a high-risk source, avoid saying anything or doing anything after submitting which might promote suspicion. In particular, you should try to stick to your normal routine and behaviour.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h4>3. Remove traces of your submission</h4>
			<p>If you are a high-risk source and the computer you prepared your submission on, or uploaded it from, could subsequently be audited in an investigation, we recommend that you format and dispose of the computer hard drive and any other storage media you used.</p>
			<p>In particular, hard drives retain data after formatting which may be visible to a digital forensics team and flash media (USB sticks, memory cards and SSD drives) retain data even after a secure erasure. If you used flash media to store sensitive data, it is important to destroy the media.</p>
			<p>If you do this and are a high-risk source you should make sure there are no traces of the clean-up, since such traces themselves may draw suspicion.</p>
			<div>
				<h4>4. If you face legal action</h4>
				<p>If a legal action is brought against you as a result of your submission, there are organisations that may help you. The Courage Foundation is an international organisation dedicated to the protection of journalistic sources. You can find more details at <a href="https://www.couragefound.org">https://www.couragefound.org</a>.</p>

		<p>WikiLeaks publishes documents of political or historical importance that are censored or otherwise suppressed. We specialise in strategic global publishing and large archives.</p>
		<p>The following is the address of our secure site where you can anonymously upload your documents to WikiLeaks editors. You can only access this submissions system through Tor. (See our <a href="#submit_help_tor">Tor tab</a> for more information.) We also advise you to read our <a href="#submit_help_tips">tips for sources</a> before submitting.</p>

   Russia: new U.S. anti-missiles less risky<br />
   October 7, 2009<br />
<br />
   MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia sees a redrafted U.S.<br />
   anti-missile shield plan as less of a security<br />
   threat than the previously proposed project,<br />
   Russian agencies said Wednesday, which should<br />
   ease tensions between the two powers.<br />
<br />
   Russia strongly opposed the original U.S. plans<br />
   made under President Barack Obama's predecessor<br />
   George W. Bush because of concerns Iran was<br />
   trying to develop nuclear missiles. Moscow saw<br />
   the scheme as a threat to its own missile<br />
   defenses and to its overall security.<br />
<br />
   &quot;The new plan, proposed by Obama's<br />
   administration, creates good conditions for<br />
   dialogue,&quot; RIA news agency quoted Russian Foreign<br />
   Minister Sergei Lavrov as saying in the Ukrainian city of Kharkiv.<br />
<br />
   Russia's President Dmitry Medvedev gave a guarded<br />
   welcome to Obama's decision to alter the earlier<br />
   Bush administration plan when the U.S. president<br />
   made his announcement in September.<br />
<br />
   But he had said Moscow needed assurances it was<br />
   not still the target. Russia's NATO envoy had<br />
   also expressed concern and suspicion at Washington's new scheme.<br />
<br />
   &quot;Our early estimates show it does not create<br />
   risks which the third positioning region of the<br />
   U.S. anti-missile shield would create,&quot; Lavrov said Wednesday.<br />
<br />
   The Pentagon says it only wants to target small<br />
   and medium-range missiles from other countries,<br />
   but Moscow says it needs convincing the system<br />
   will not threaten the 3,000-plus Russian<br />
   strategic warheads still pointing at U.S. and NATO countries.<br />
<br />
   Russia would be concerned if the new sea-based<br />
   interceptors are based in Arctic waters, the<br />
   North Sea or the Baltic Sea as this would imply<br />
   that the trajectories of Russian ballistic missiles could be tracked.<br />

   Russia Needs To Add Asteroid Hazard Study To National Space Program -<br />
   Opinion<br />
<br />
   MOSCOW, October 6 (Itar-Tass) -- It is time for<br />
   Russia to supplement the national space program<br />
   with the study of the asteroid hazard and<br />
   possible ways to protect the Earth, said<br />
   participants in the State Duma hearings on planetary security.<br />
<br />
   The asteroid hazard, which had been sporadically<br />
   catching the public eye since the end of the 19th<br />
   century, caused profound concern of researchers<br />
   several years ago when Asteroid Apophis was discovered.<br />
<br />
   Asteroid Apophis may pass dangerously close from<br />
   the Earth in 2029, press secretary of the Russian<br />
   Academy of Sciences' Main Astronomical<br />
   Observatory Sergei Smirnov told Itar-Tass.<br />
<br />
   &quot;According to the preliminary estimates, it will<br />
   pass ten times closer than the distance between<br />
   the Earth and the Moon,&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
   &quot;Obviously, the 600-meter boulder will do nothing<br />
   good, especially as it is planned to position<br />
   telecom satellite platforms on the geo-stationary<br />
   orbit by that time. It is now impossible to calculate the prospective<br />
   orbit<br />
   of the asteroid right now,&quot; Smirnov said.<br />
<br />
   &quot;Apophis is expected to come close in 2012 as<br />
   well, and then its orbit of 2029 will be<br />
   calculated more precisely. We need to know the<br />
   asteroid's trajectory with the precision of tens<br />
   of meters in order to say for sure whether it may<br />
   hit the Earth or not,&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
   &quot;The International Astronomy Union has urged<br />
   mankind to make a comprehensive analysis of the<br />
   asteroid danger. The Applied Astronomy Institute<br />
   of the Russian Academy of Sciences, which<br />
   coordinates the research of small planets and the<br />
   asteroid danger, has produced a catalog of 300<br />
   potentially dangerous asteroids and comets,&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
   The catalog gives information about speeds of<br />
   celestial bodies and a potential impact of their<br />
   theoretical collision with the Earth, he said.<br />
   Each day the Earth comes closer to at least one<br />
   of nearly 100,000 small planets, which have been<br />
   discovered since 1801, and each year tens of<br />
   tonnes of meteorite substance lands on the Earth, Smirnov said.<br />
<br />
   As of April 16, 2008, the Apophis impact<br />
   probability for April 13, 2036, was calculated as<br />
   1 in 45,000. An additional impact date in 2037<br />
   was also identified; the impact probability for<br />
   that encounter was calculated as 1 in 12.3<br />
   million. Many scientists agree that Apophis<br />
   warrants closer scrutiny and, to that end, in<br />
   February 2008 the Planetary Society awarded<br />
   $50,000 in prize money to companies and students<br />
   who submitted designs for space probes that would<br />
   put a tracking device on or near the asteroid<br />
<br />
   After the Minor Planet Center confirmed the June<br />
   discovery of Apophis, the next close approach was<br />
   computed to be April 13, 2029, by the automatic<br />
   Sentry system of NASA's Near-Earth Object Program<br />
   Office. NEODyS, a similar automatic system at the<br />
   University of Pisa, Italy and the University of<br />
   Valladolid, Spain also calculated this same<br />
   approach date. On that date, it will become as<br />
   bright as magnitude 3.3 (visible to the naked eye<br />
   from rural and some darker suburban areas,<br />
   visible with binoculars from most locations).<br />
   This close approach will be visible from Europe, Africa, and western Asia.<br />
<br />
   On Friday, April 13, 2029, Apophis will pass<br />
   Earth within the orbits of geosynchronous<br />
   communication satellites. It will return for<br />
   another close Earth approach in 2036.<br />
<br />
   NASA initially estimated the energy that Apophis<br />
   would have released if it struck Earth as the<br />
   equivalent of 1,480 megatons of TNT. A later,<br />
   more refined NASA estimate was 880 megatons. The<br />
   impacts, which created the Barringer Crater or<br />
   caused the Tunguska event are estimated to be in<br />
   the 3-10 megaton range. The 1883 eruption of<br />
   Krakatoa was the equivalent of roughly 200 megatons.<br />
<br />
   The exact effects of any impact would vary based<br />
   on the asteroid's composition, and the location<br />
   and angle of impact. Any impact would be<br />
   extremely detrimental to an area of thousands of<br />
   square kilometers, but would be unlikely to have<br />
   long-lasting global effects, such as the initiation of an impact winter.<br />
<br />
   Head of the Planetary Protection Center Anatoly<br />
   Zaitsev admitted that collisions with asteroid<br />
   were very rare and happened once in several<br />
   hundreds of thousands or even millions of years.<br />
   Yet the Earth should stay alert, he said. &quot;In<br />
   fact, a catastrophe may happen any moment. Only<br />
   6,300 out of approximately two million asteroids<br />
   with the size exceeding 50 meters have been discovered,&quot; the researcher<br />
   said.<br />
<br />
   Russia has several options. It may hope for a<br />
   miracle and do nothing, or it may assign funds<br />
   for studying the problem and evaluating the<br />
   possibility of the collision, or it may create a<br />
   planetary protection system. The system,<br />
   codenamed Citadel, must at least detect dangerous<br />
   asteroids before they reach the solar system or,<br />
   ideally, change the asteroids' orbits and destroy<br />
   them with thermonuclear charges. The orbit change<br />
   is more preferable, as fragments of a large<br />
   asteroid would still pose a lethal danger to the Earth.<br />

   COMMENT: Russian government ready for dialogue<br />
   By Anon. Troika, Russia<br />
<br />
   Everything comes if a man will only wait.<br />
   Benjamin Disraeli<br />
<br />
   It looks as though political and economic<br />
   activity in Russia has enlivened across the board<br />
   after the August lull. Not only has the Russian<br />
   market been growing and showing the first signs<br />
   of economic recovery, but the countrya**s political<br />
   life seems much more vibrant than it had in the<br />
   previous several months. A slight hint of liberal<br />
   values can even be noted in the political arena a**<br />
   or at the very least, officialsa** rhetoric has<br />
   suddenly become more pragmatic and investor friendly.<br />
<br />
   Russia appears more willing to cooperate with the<br />
   West in efforts aimed at limiting Irana**s nuclear<br />
   program, most likely a concession won by the USa**<br />
   decision to suspend developing its anti missile<br />
   shield in Eastern Europe. More indications of the<br />
   improvements in Russia US relations were seen<br />
   during the G 20 meeting. Russiaa**s interactions<br />
   with NATO have also become somewhat warmer and<br />
   more cooperative. The Western press seems<br />
   increasingly balanced in evaluating the causes of<br />
   last yeara**s conflict between Russia and Georgia<br />
   after the European Commission released its report<br />
   on its origins, blaming Georgia for starting the<br />
   war and Russia for responding disproportionately.<br />
   A resulting disagreement within the Parliamentary<br />
   Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE) nearly<br />
   ended in Russia being stripped of its voting<br />
   rights in the organization, though this<br />
   initiative was ultimately rejected by the assembly when put to a vote.<br />
<br />
   Meanwhile, President Dmitri Medvedev in early<br />
   September published an article on the internet<br />
   with the very symbolic title a**Go Russia!a** in<br />
   which he gave an extended list of problems that<br />
   face the country. This piece is a clear<br />
   reminiscence of what then President Vladimir<br />
   Putin used to speak (and write) about in 2000 04,<br />
   i.e. when oil was cheap and the country<br />
   desperately needed to find new growth drivers.<br />
   His annual addresses to the Federation Council<br />
   and other speeches were full of calls to<br />
   strengthen institutions a** starting with the legal<br />
   system a** and fight corruption, among others. The<br />
   fact that Medvedev is still talking about the<br />
   same issues today says a lot. But if one re reads<br />
   what Russiaa**s liberal press was writing in the<br />
   mid 19th century, one might learn that even then,<br />
   the countrya**s reformers were discussion potential<br />
   solutions to these very same problems.<br />
<br />
   It is rather telling that only a small minority<br />
   of Russians were aware of Medvedeva**s publication;<br />
   the Levada Center insists that only 3% have read<br />
   it. This is probably only slightly higher than<br />
   the%age of those who read the liberal press 150 years ago.<br />
<br />
   That less than half of those who read the a**Go<br />
   Russia!a** article liked it is also quite<br />
   informative a** it illustrates that Russian society<br />
   as a whole remains as conservative and paternalistic as centuries ago.<br />
<br />
   So Western politicians and journalists, instead<br />
   of blaming the countrya**s leadership on an<br />
   authoritarian governance and lack of democracy in<br />
   the country, should perhaps look at the entire<br />
   nation, which feels quite comfortable with the political system it has.<br />
<br />
   The nation remains quite conservative and<br />
   paternalistic in many aspects, and more time and<br />
   greater openness in the country will be required<br />
   to change the habits and mentality of the entire society.<br />
<br />
   Here we are referring not only to a sort of<br />
   nihilism and a tendency to ignore pure legal<br />
   issues, but a widespread disrespect of all basic<br />
   rules, including, for instance, those related to<br />
   traffic regulation. It is not only the drivers<br />
   who serve top Russian officials (escorted by<br />
   security services) who ignore rules, but the<br />
   majority of Russians as well. This is why the<br />
   death toll on Russiaa**s roads and the number of<br />
   traffic accidents is still so big compared with many other countries.<br />
<br />
   Despite this paternalism, there is enough common<br />
   sense and people understand that social support<br />
   cannot come from nowhere. That said, it is<br />
   economic growth that is crucial for the country.<br />
<br />
   Indeed, opinion polls indicate that the situation<br />
   is gradually developing in a rather positive<br />
   direction overall (not on the roads alone, but in<br />
   a broader sense, including minor changes in<br />
   politics as well), and the trend will continue<br />
   amid economic growth, even though a minority of<br />
   Russians expect those changes to come a** a quite cynical point of view.<br />
<br />
   One key point to keep in mind is that Russians do<br />
   not believe that Russia is a backward country<br />
   with a primitive economy based on national resources.<br />
<br />
   Where the Russians are united is in their<br />
   attitude toward corruption. Fewer than 10 %<br />
   believe that corruption is not an issue.<br />
<br />
   We have continually reiterated that economic<br />
   growth, which is impossible without greater<br />
   openness in the country, will keep gradually<br />
   transforming society, and social and political<br />
   systems. This is what most Russians would like to<br />
   see and support, even though what democracy means<br />
   for Russians is not entirely clear. Polls<br />
   indicate that Russians would like to have a sort<br />
   of democracy that would be different from what is<br />
   traditionally seen as democracy in the West. What<br />
   this could mean is not clear, but we are not sure<br />
   that all Russians have a clear understanding<br />
   themselves of how democratic institutions operate<br />
   in the West. Polls indicate that there is no<br />
   clear vision of how democracy needs to evolve in<br />
   the country. In particular, what is clearly seen<br />
   is that Russians are not very much in favor of<br />
   political parties. Where people are united is in<br />
   their belief that the country needs growth, and<br />
   the wealthier Russia become, the more freedom and<br />
   democracy will develop. It is hard to disagree<br />
   with that. Most Russians would like to live in a<br />
   democratic country, even though the%age of<br />
   citizens who think so is much lower than in other countries.<br />
<br />
   As seen from the polls, confusion about where and<br />
   how fast Russia needs to go is strong. As<br />
   citizens disagree that their country is a<br />
   backward state with a primitive economy based on<br />
   natural resources, there is no need to rush<br />
   reforms. Life is good as it is, and the sort of<br />
   stability that the county currently enjoys is<br />
   more important than anything else a** a clear sign<br />
   that people would like to see a more natural<br />
   evolutionary development, rather than another<br />
   painful shock similar to that of the 1990s.<br />
   Politicians need to take this into account and<br />
   none of those who would like to stay in power<br />
   will talk about reforms as their primary agenda.<br />
<br />
   Where we may see a real change and what the<br />
   political leadership will try to clean up is<br />
   certain transformation of the legal system and<br />
   law enforcement structures, which is seemingly an<br />
   agenda of Medvedeva**s administration. Some action<br />
   has been taken, and that is what the Russians would like to see changing.<br />
<br />
   Despite the fact that Russians reject Western<br />
   democratic values, half of the population would<br />
   like to have closer cultural and economic integration with the West.<br />
<br />
   That said, we will most likely see a rather<br />
   gradual transformation of Russiaa**s social and<br />
   political system, politicians will keep<br />
   responding to the fact that the electorate does<br />
   not want shocks and reforms any more, but the<br />
   entire nation is interested in economic growth.<br />
   How to achieve this goal of growing fast without<br />
   transforming the institutions is a puzzle that<br />
   politicians have to solve, but we are not sure that there is a solution.<br />

   Medvedev Invites Ukrainian Magician To Perform; Keeps His Yoga Practice<br />
   Quiet<br />
<br />
   Sobesednik<br />
   September 29, 2009<br />
   Report by Liana Nalbandyan: &quot;Medvedev in Lotus Pose&quot;<br />
<br />
   The fact that our current head of state practices<br />
   yoga is known to only a narrow circle. The same<br />
   circle also knows about his love of card tricks.<br />
<br />
   Deft Hands and No Cheating<br />
<br />
   Poltavan Nikolay Bidenko now, even in places<br />
   where he performs, is announced as the<br />
   president's favorite magician. Three years ago<br />
   the illusionist with Ukrainian citizenship<br />
   managed to land in a celebration for the then<br />
   future head of state. Ever since, the magician<br />
   has been a regular guest at private presidential receptions.<br />
<br />
   &quot;They invite me along with other artists and we<br />
   perform for the president's guests at private<br />
   receptions or in a narrow family circle,&quot; Bidenko<br />
   recounted. &quot;Often we don't even know exactly<br />
   where they're taking us. It could even be the<br />
   residence in Sochi. At one of the performances I<br />
   was able to meet Vladimir Putin.&quot;<br />
<br />
   We might assume that the musician wins over his<br />
   VIP viewers with fancy numbers, but alas. Nothing<br />
   &quot;like that&quot; happens in Bidenko's performances.<br />
<br />
   &quot;I don't have tricks with fire or knives, and I<br />
   don't use any complicated equipment,&quot; Nikolay<br />
   says. &quot;All I need fits into one small bag. My<br />
   numbers are classics -- tricks with cards, coins,<br />
   disappearing objects, transforming dollar bills . . .&quot;<br />
<br />
   Tricks with foreign currency may relieve the<br />
   president from his problems with our national<br />
   one. By the way, the cost of the elite magician<br />
   is also quite anti-crisis -- $500 per half-hour.<br />
   Although performing for the president is, of course, priceless.<br />
<br />
   Dmitriy Medvedev's son Ilya liked Bidenko's<br />
   unpretentious tricks. The boy wanted to learn how<br />
   to manipulate bills. Under pressure from his<br />
   young viewer, the magician even revealed some of<br />
   his professional secrets. Now Ilya demonstrates<br />
   to &quot;Uncle Kolya&quot; (Bidenko) his successes and in<br />
   the family circle even takes an active part in the Poltavan's<br />
   performances.<br />
<br />
   The president himself can also do a few card<br />
   tricks. But which sleight-of-hand he does best of<br />
   all I was unable to find out.<br />
<br />
   &quot;I can't go into those kinds of details,&quot; the<br />
   magician said agitatedly. &quot;The special services<br />
   have forbidden me from talking on those topics at all.&quot;<br />
<br />
   Yoga Does Not Fit in with the Orthodox Theme<br />
<br />
   One other hobby of the president is yoga. He<br />
   practices it at least once a week.<br />
<br />
   As the president's first teacher people name a<br />
   certain German with the Eastern name Aloka Nama<br />
   Ba Khal (name as transliterated).<br />
<br />
   &quot;Aloka did in fact work with the president at one<br />
   time, but we don't know the details,&quot; Irina, the<br />
   German's manager, recounted. &quot;In general, all our<br />
   work is structured long-distance. During a single<br />
   class we can do only the 'divine straightening of the spine.'&quot;<br />
<br />
   The president's spine really is straight,<br />
   although this does not rule out the fact that the<br />
   Germans may simply be getting some PR for themselves using Medvedev's<br />
   name.<br />
<br />
   &quot;That's crazy. I've never heard of any German<br />
   yoga,&quot; one yoga instructor spoke out. &quot;I know<br />
   that two of my colleagues work with Medvedev.<br />
   These are experienced people who have been<br />
   practicing for many years. But they are Russians<br />
   and live in Moscow. They teach classic hatha<br />
   yoga, which is what the president practices. This<br />
   is the course for beginners. Afterward come more difficult practices.&quot;<br />
<br />
   They say that Medvedev's wife Svetlana got him<br />
   interested in Eastern practices. Sometimes the<br />
   spouses even practice together. But talking about<br />
   this Medvedev hobby is forbidden. The president's<br />
   press service told Sobesednik that they<br />
   categorically refused to talk about it.<br />
<br />
   &quot;We won't either. You realize, this is a<br />
   complicated subject,&quot; they explained at the<br />
   Russian Federation of Yogis, which, by the way,<br />
   was founded around the time of Medvedev's<br />
   inauguration. &quot;The Orthodox Church doesn't<br />
   approve of yoga, so for now we're sort of in the<br />
   underground. When we become firmly established on<br />
   the state level, then we will come out into the open.&quot;<br />
<br />
   Evidently, due to secrecy requirements, the<br />
   presidential hobby has not become as popular in<br />
   gubernatorial-official circles as tennis,<br />
   downhill skiing, and judo once were. But a trend has already been noted.<br />
<br />
   &quot;Officials have started coming to us more often,<br />
   and there have even been some highly placed<br />
   policemen,&quot; Petersburg yoga instructor Natalya<br />
   Grunina says. &quot;But there won't be enough of them<br />
   who stick with it. Yoga isn't just a fashion,<br />
   it's a way of life. In addition, there really is<br />
   a conflict here with Orthodoxy, and for people<br />
   with status the latter is still more important.&quot;<br />

   Putin marks birthday with writers, church praise<br />
   By Oleg Shchedrov<br />
   October 7, 2009<br />
<br />
   MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia's most powerful<br />
   politician Vladimir Putin marked his 57th<br />
   birthday on Wednesday in the company of literary<br />
   luminaries, lauded by the Orthodox Church for his<br />
   wisdom, viewed askance by critics sensing a nascent personality cult.<br />
<br />
   The &quot;Nezavisimaya Gazeta&quot; daily published an &quot;Ode<br />
   to Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin&quot; written in a<br />
   style typical of poems devoted to former Soviet dictator Josef Stalin.<br />
<br />
   &quot;The country is again at a crossroads wondering<br />
   whether it might perish or not,&quot; the ditty reads.<br />
   &quot;We congratulate you comrade Putin and ask God to give you another 120<br />
   years.&quot;<br />
<br />
   As prime minister and leader of the ruling party,<br />
   Putin enjoys lavish, uncritical publicity on<br />
   state television, something which critics say helps explain his high<br />
   ratings.<br />
<br />
   As allies and supporters like Belarus's<br />
   authoritarian leader Alexander Lukashenko rushed<br />
   to congratulate Putin on his birthday, some<br />
   writers said they were boycotting a meeting with<br />
   the premier on Wednesday in a Moscow literary museum.<br />
<br />
   &quot;I do not see myself in the role of<br />
   'congratulator' or the one who delivers flower<br />
   and gifts.&quot; said writer Dmitry Bykov.<br />
<br />
   Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the meeting<br />
   with writers was not linked to the premier's birthday.<br />
<br />
   &quot;The meeting will proceed in a format of a free<br />
   conversation touching upon issues like the role<br />
   of literature in life, and the publishing<br />
   business,&quot; Peskov said. &quot;A broad range of<br />
   philosophical and practical problems will also be discussed.&quot;<br />
<br />
   Leading Russian classic writers like Valentin<br />
   Rasputin and Andrei Bitov, as well as<br />
   best-selling novelists like Alexander Kabakov<br />
   will attend. Foreign news media were not invited.<br />
<br />
   Bykov told Russian News Service radio he was not<br />
   staying away for ideological reasons but because<br />
   &quot;when (a meeting) happens on the premier's<br />
   birthday there is a great chance that instead of<br />
   a reasonable conversation it will be a formal event.&quot;<br />
<br />
   Putin handed over the presidency in May 2008 to<br />
   handpicked successor Dmitry Medvedev. He took the<br />
   more junior post of prime minister but he is<br />
   widely believed to make all key decisions.<br />
<br />
   The former KGB spy has become a devout believer<br />
   since the collapse of communism and Russian<br />
   Orthodox Patriarch Kirill was among the first to<br />
   congratulate Putin on his birthday.<br />
<br />
   &quot;Wisdom based on rich political experience,<br />
   typical for you, is a guarantee of stability in<br />
   our state,&quot; Kirill wrote in a congratulatory<br />
   message carried by Russian news agencies.<br />
<br />
   THE RUSSIAN GENES<br />
<br />
   Writers in Soviet times could be equally<br />
   ascerbic, but hid their mockery in articles 'coded' to slip past censors.<br />
<br />
   One magazine famously carried a story about a<br />
   pompous and vainglorious writer long overdue for<br />
   retirement. The item, published ahead of<br />
   bemedalled leader Leonid Brezhnev's 75th birthday, appeared on page 75.<br />
<br />
   Putin stepped down from the top Kremlin job after<br />
   serving the maximum two consecutive terms allowed by the constitution.<br />
<br />
   But after taking a break from the presidency,<br />
   speculation is increasing that Putin may run<br />
   again in 2012, this time for a six-year term,<br />
   with the possibility of a second to follow it.<br />
<br />
   Putin himself fanned this speculation by saying<br />
   he would decide with Medvedev nearer the time<br />
   which of them would run. Medvedev later said he<br />
   could run in 2012, but was equally ready for<br />
   another job &quot;as long as it is useful for the nation.&quot;<br />
<br />
   Igor Yurgens, who heads a think-tank working for<br />
   Medvedev, told Reuters recently that &quot;the cult of<br />
   personality is in our genes,&quot; citing busts and<br />
   portraits that appeared after Putin's first term<br />
   -- though he said Putin himself had resisted it.<br />
<br />
   &quot;I believe this is the nature of Russian power,&quot;<br />
   Yurgens added. &quot;There is huge inertia living in<br />
   this secret Kremlin, looking out on those<br />
   1,500-year-old towers and churches. Something happens inside you, I<br />
   guess.&quot;<br />

   Television Self-Censorship Eyed<br />
<br />
   Gazeta.ru<br />
   September 28, 2009<br />
   Editorial comment &quot;Russia's Black Box&quot;<br />
<br />
   Censorship on national Russian television<br />
   inevitably breeds self-censorship. And<br />
   furthermore, television is not only censoring reality, but itself as well.<br />
<br />
   Russia's top television award, the TEFI, which<br />
   has already in recent years become less and less<br />
   valued even among the professional community (the<br />
   public, strictly speaking, has never paid any<br />
   attention to it), has given rise to yet another<br />
   scandal, and this one has gone beyond the<br />
   boundaries of its own television back yard. The<br />
   Television Academy awards ceremony, in the<br />
   &quot;Personalities&quot; category, was for the first time<br />
   entrusted to Saint Petersburg to conduct and<br />
   broadcast live to Channel Five, which, thanks to<br />
   Vladimir Putin, has secured the status of a<br />
   federal channel. After the broadcast, it<br />
   transpired that portions meaningful for its participants had been cut.<br />
<br />
   The primary scandal occurred around the speech of<br />
   Vladimir Pozner, who attended the TEFI for the<br />
   first time in the status of a rank and file<br />
   member of the Television Academy, and not as its<br />
   permanent president. The Academy bestowed on him<br />
   one of its most honorable awards -- &quot;For<br />
   Contributions to the Development of Television.&quot;<br />
   At the same time, Vladimir Pozner's words,<br />
   dedicated to the fathers of perestroika, were cut<br />
   out of the televised version: &quot;I was not allowed<br />
   on the screen during Soviet times. If there had<br />
   been no perestroika and glasnost, no Mikhail<br />
   Sergeyevich Gorbachev and Aleksandr Nikolayevich<br />
   Yakovlev, this would not have been. I name these<br />
   names entirely deliberately. I am happy that I<br />
   found myself in that time....&quot; Pozner himself<br />
   referred to the censorship of his words on the<br />
   air as &quot;stupidity and idiocy&quot;: &quot;It is even hard<br />
   for me to say at all at what level the decision<br />
   was made to cut out the names Gorbachev and<br />
   Yakovlev. But I think that it is hardly likely to<br />
   have been at a very high one,&quot; he said in an<br />
   interview with Kommersant. In response, the press<br />
   service of Channel Five announced that this had<br />
   not been censorship, but technical problems with<br />
   the live broadcast and timekeeping.<br />
<br />
   Russian television in the era of Putin's mop-up<br />
   operation of the airwaves really did get out of<br />
   the habit of live broadcasts, even from a<br />
   technical standpoint. It is simply that there is<br />
   no experience of this. At the same time, in our<br />
   television industry, even relatively petty<br />
   clerks, to say nothing of the top television<br />
   brass, are prepared, &quot;in autopilot mode,&quot; to cut<br />
   mentions in any positive context of perestroika<br />
   and glasnost, of Gorbachev and Yakovlev. Simply<br />
   because in their heads, the authorities have<br />
   already formulated rigid ideological cliches such<br />
   as &quot;the awful 1990s&quot; and the perestroika years,<br />
   which have not yet received such an official<br />
   label but which have also not been so very<br />
   favored. Gorbachev and Yakovlev, in the<br />
   consciousness of the Kremlin curators of national<br />
   television, and also, which is much more<br />
   important, at least one of the two Russian<br />
   rulers, are first and foremost perpetrators of<br />
   &quot;the worst geo-political catastrophe of the 20th<br />
   century&quot; (Vladimir Putin on the collapse of the<br />
   USSR), and then already the authors, of course,<br />
   of the failed perestroika and glasnost, which is<br />
   being consciously buried by the current power<br />
   structure. Furthermore, what is important for the<br />
   television bosses is not what is said at an<br />
   awards ceremony for contributions to the<br />
   profession by one of the most respected masters<br />
   of television, but what the political bosses will say after the airing.<br />
<br />
   The responsibility for censorship on television,<br />
   just as it is in the media on the whole, is borne<br />
   not only by the power structure. It is also borne<br />
   by the bosses of these media. It is clear that<br />
   the primary national television channels in the<br />
   2000s have discredited television as a<br />
   profession, which has been expressed in the<br />
   flight from these channels of practically the<br />
   entire audience of educated persons and those who<br />
   are inclined to independent thought, as well as<br />
   the manifest degradation of the professional<br />
   television awards. But the problem of censorship<br />
   and self-censorship on television, this<br />
   all-Russian &quot;you can never be too careful,&quot; is<br />
   not only happening on television. Russia has<br />
   practically never lived without censorship. In<br />
   tsarist times, it was sometimes milder and<br />
   sometimes harsher; in Soviet times under Lenin,<br />
   it turned out to be much milder than it was under<br />
   Stalin, but it always adequately reflected the<br />
   degree of the state's insanity. Moreover, it is<br />
   precisely censorship that has not given and does<br />
   not to this day give the great bulk of the<br />
   Russian people the opportunity to get real ideas<br />
   of the history of their country. It is necessary to ferret them out.<br />
<br />
   In this sense, television remains Russia's &quot;black<br />
   box,&quot; concealing the country's real face from the<br />
   people living in it. This cannot continue<br />
   indefinitely. The Soviet Union collapsed not<br />
   least because the distance between the power<br />
   structure and the population, between the<br />
   television picture and the reality at a certain<br />
   moment in history turned out to be critically<br />
   long. People stopped believing in the picture of<br />
   the world drawn by the official propaganda -- as<br />
   a result, the great &quot;Communist Empire,&quot; conceived<br />
   for centuries, turned out to be a fiction. The<br />
   people and the power structure simply found themselves in different<br />
   worlds.<br />
<br />
   Therefore, the television channel needed not to<br />
   cut out the important points from the speech of<br />
   Vladimir Pozner not only to retain the remnants<br />
   of its self-respect and not only for the sake of<br />
   the respect for the personality of the TEFI<br />
   nominee, but even proceeding from considerations<br />
   of elementary historical continuity and, if this<br />
   is more understandable for the television<br />
   channel, of the state security. When every 10 or<br />
   20 years, the preceding decades are declared to<br />
   be &quot;outside the law&quot; in our country, the country<br />
   in principle cannot exist as an historic<br />
   organism; all of its life turns out to be a<br />
   propaganda trick, an endless operation to<br />
   brainwash the population. So Russian television<br />
   is engaging in a falsification of modernity to<br />
   the detriment of the interests of Russia, and<br />
   furthermore with the approval of the political power structure.<br />

   Medvedev Pitches Nanotechnology<br />
   By Alex Anishyuk<br />
<br />
   Nanotechnology will rival oil as a global<br />
   powerhouse industry, so Russiaa**s economy needs to<br />
   embrace it now to avoid a repeat of the<br />
   a**well-known scenarioa** in which growing oil prices<br />
   keep it from modernizing, President Dmitry Medvedev said Tuesday.<br />
<br />
   Medvedev spoke at the opening of the<br />
   International Nanotechnology Forum, where one<br />
   senior official said the burden to create new<br />
   innovations should fall on small and midsized businesses.<br />
<br />
   Rusnano chief Anatoly Chubais, meanwhile, gave<br />
   Deputy Prime Minister Sergei Ivanov a guided tour<br />
   of an exhibition of new Russian nanotechnology,<br />
   including a photodiode lamp that appeared to temporarily blind Ivanov.<br />
<br />
   a**The economic crisis is a great impetus for an<br />
   economic renewal,a** Medvedev said in his speech at<br />
   the Krasnaya Presnya Expocenter.<br />
<br />
   a**But the main challenge,a** he said, a**is to avoid<br />
   the well-known scenario where oil prices are on<br />
   the rise and the economy is improving and, again,<br />
   just like in previous years, no one needs<br />
   nanotechnology because we can relax and make ends<br />
   meet without innovations. We therefore must make<br />
   nanotechnology one of the main sectors of the economy.a**<br />
<br />
   Medvedev also said the main lesson that Russia<br />
   should learn during the crisis was the need to<br />
   diversify its natural resources-oriented economy.<br />
<br />
   a**We should not focus our economy on natural<br />
   resources, no matter how tremendous they are,a** he<br />
   said. a**However, there havena**t been any changes so<br />
   far. The crisis hit the economy, but no one wants<br />
   to change anything, which of course is a sad conclusion.a**<br />
<br />
   The global nanotechnology market is worth about<br />
   $250 billion today and may reach $2 trillion to<br />
   $3 trillion by 2015, making it comparable to the<br />
   market of natural resources, Medvedev said, citing independent estimates.<br />
<br />
   Russia has a number of advantages that could make<br />
   it a leader in this field, he said.<br />
<br />
   a**We have a competitive scientific base, spacious<br />
   domestic market and active state support,a** he said.<br />
<br />
   Medvedev said a nanotechnology funding program<br />
   approved by the government Monday was the largest<br />
   in the world, with up to 318 billion rubles<br />
   ($3.95 billion) earmarked until 2015. He said the<br />
   sectora**s sales in Russia would reach 900 billion<br />
   rubles by that time, but he scolded the statea**s<br />
   management of the sector as a**disorderly.a**<br />
<br />
   a**The role of the sector is clear and the statea**s<br />
   efforts are quite active, but we have failed to<br />
   understand the essence of what exactly needs to be done,a** he said.<br />
<br />
   The new innovations should be created by small<br />
   and midsized businesses, Sergei Mazurenko, head<br />
   of the Federal Science and Innovations Agency, told The Moscow Times.<br />
<br />
   a**We should be more systematic in developing new<br />
   high-tech production by creating medium-sized and<br />
   small science-intensive businesses,a** Mazurenko<br />
   said. a**In addition, we need extensive applied<br />
   research in order to create competitive nanoproducts.a**<br />
<br />
   Most small businesses in Russia nowadays are in<br />
   the service sector, not high technology, he added.<br />
<br />
   Medvedev criticized private companies for being<br />
   a**inerta** when it comes to investing in<br />
   nanotechnology, saying the statea**s main task was<br />
   to stimulate the interest of private investors in this sector.<br />
<br />
   Medvedev said that to develop the sector, the<br />
   government needed to reform the tax system,<br />
   introduce a**green customs corridorsa** for high-tech<br />
   exports, and place orders for innovative products.<br />
<br />
   He stressed that qualified specialists needed to<br />
   be trained to work in nanotechnology. a**The demand<br />
   for these specialists is roughly 100,000 to<br />
   150,000 people today,a** he said. a**We have a list<br />
   of related professional training courses approved<br />
   by the Education and Science Ministry, and if<br />
   this list doesna**t give us enough capabilities, it should be changed.a**<br />
<br />
   Ivanov, the deputy prime minister whose portfolio<br />
   includes nanotechnology, praised the allocation<br />
   of funds for state-owned Rusnano that was signed<br />
   Monday by Prime Minister Vladimir Putin as he was<br />
   escorted by Chubais around the nanotechnology<br />
   exhibition shortly before the opening of the forum.<br />
<br />
   Walking along the aisles, Ivanov and Chubais<br />
   stopped to glance at various items on display. A<br />
   laptop with a cover painted in nano-ink to look<br />
   exactly like crocodile skin excited them both,<br />
   while Chubais was notably proud to present a<br />
   vertical laser emitter, one of the latest Russian innovations.<br />
<br />
   a**This is a Russian development that can be used<br />
   for data transmission,a** Chubais told Ivanov.<br />
<br />
   The next exhibit that caught Ivanova**s attention<br />
   was a photodiode lamp that shone so bright that Ivanov winced for a<br />
   moment.<br />
<br />
   a**Somebody, turn the lamp off. We dona**t want to<br />
   blind our deputy prime minister,a** Chubais<br />
   commanded in a joking tone. Somebody immediately unplugged the unit.<br />
<br />
   Meanwhile, Ivanov kept asking Chubais about when<br />
   the various products on display would enter<br />
   industrial production, and Chubais gave dates over the next several years.<br />
<br />
   Earlier, Rusnano announced that it has approved financing for 36 projects.<br />
<br />
   Mazurenko, chief of the Federal Science and<br />
   Innovations Agency, touted Russian<br />
   nanotechnology, noting that the Solver Next<br />
   automated scanning probe microscope made by the<br />
   Moscow-based NT-MDT company was selected by<br />
   independent experts of R&amp;D Magazine as one of the<br />
   worlda**s 100 best nanotechnology achievements of the year.<br />
<br />
   a**However, there is still a lot of work that needs<br />
   to be done to develop a successful nanotechnology sector,a** he said.<br />
<br />
   The state will develop but not manage the<br />
   nanotechnology sector, Chubais said at a news conference.<br />
<br />
   a**I fully support the funding program that will be<br />
   in force until 2015, but beginning from 2016 the<br />
   state should abandon funding and private capital<br />
   should seize the initiative by that time,a** he said.<br />
<br />
   a**I meet two to three oligarchs a week, and more<br />
   than half of them have decided to redirect their<br />
   funds into innovative technology,a** he said.<br />
<br />
   Chubais signed an agreement with Sberbank chief<br />
   German Gref on the sidelines of the forum under<br />
   which the state-owned bank will provide 45<br />
   billion rubles ($1.5 billion) in loans, Chubais said.<br />
<br />
   Ivanov awarded the Russian Nanotechnology Prize,<br />
   a crystal ball, to Russian academic Leonid<br />
   Keldysh and U.S. professor Alfred Cho for their<br />
   innovative methods of creating nanostructures.<br />

   Russian Business Still Resource-oriented - Medvedev<br />
<br />
   MOSCOW. Oct 6 (Interfax) - Russian business<br />
   structures remain resource-oriented, despite the<br />
   lessons learned from the financial and economic<br />
   crisis, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev said at<br />
   the opening ceremony of the international forum on nanotechnologies in<br />
   Moscow.<br />
<br />
   Medvedev said the years that preceded the<br />
   economic crisis created &quot;relative economic<br />
   comfort&quot; for Russia. At the same time,<br />
   post-crisis economy &quot;should be based on knowledge<br />
   and innovation technologies, not on Russia's<br />
   resource potential, no matter how limitless they may be.&quot;<br />
<br />
   &quot;Nothing has changed in this area yet, and,<br />
   despite the fact that the crisis has hit everyone<br />
   hard, no one wants to change. It's a sad<br />
   conclusion, and I have to make it. Our business<br />
   is not changing yet, and the state is not<br />
   changing the way we would like it to,&quot; Medvedev said.<br />
<br />
   Medvedev pointed out the importance of active<br />
   support for investment and nanotechnologies from<br />
   the state and private businesses. &quot;In my view,<br />
   this support is still somewhat chaotic,&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
   &quot;Even though the role of the state is obvious,<br />
   decisions have been made, and a corporation has<br />
   been created, but we have still not been able to<br />
   get the essence of this work,&quot; he said. &quot;We are<br />
   working, working hard, but this work still needs<br />
   to be improved,&quot; the president said.<br />
<br />
   Medvedev criticized private business investments<br />
   in nanotechnologies. &quot;It's a separate issue. I<br />
   believe businesses' behavior in this sphere is<br />
   extremely interesting. I don't mean state-run<br />
   business and support from the state structures, I<br />
   mean private business. It probably just lacks<br />
   financing, and large businesses likely just don't<br />
   take an interest in this sphere,&quot; Medvedev said.<br />
<br />
   Medvedev said the purpose of the state is to<br />
   attract large-medium-sized, and small businesses<br />
   and stimulate them to invest in nanotechnologies.<br />

   YEAR OF STRUGGLE<br />
   Absence of public control impairs effectiveness of anti-corruption efforts<br />
   Author: not indicated<br />
   WAR ON CORRUPTION: NO PUBLIC OR MEDIA CONTROL<br />
<br />
         President Dmitry Medvedev declared a war on corruption<br />
   exactly a year ago. Drawn in accordance with the National Anti-<br />
   Corruption Plan endorsed by the president, anti-corruption laws<br />
   were forwarded to the Duma in early October 2008.<br />
         A year later, law enforcement agencies report many more<br />
   corruption charges pressed these days... and increase in size of<br />
   the average bribe in Russia.<br />
         Prosecutor General Yuri Chaika is convinced that legal<br />
   foundation of the war on corruption is practically formed.<br />
   Unfortunately, the Duma left a loophole when adopting the anti-<br />
   corruption legislation. It ruled that some provisions of the<br />
   legislation in question would come into force in 2010.<br />
         In any event, efforts to uproot this evil continue. On the<br />
   other hand, ministries and departments deal with corruption as<br />
   they see fit and convenient. There is no special body coordinating<br />
   their efforts. What really counts, however, is that all this<br />
   struggle is restricted to the bureaucratic machinery itself. There<br />
   is no public or media control over the process. That this lack of<br />
   control affects effectiveness of struggle as such goes without<br />
   saying.<br />

   Russian Prosecutor-General Says Solid Legal Base To Fight Corruption<br />
<br />
   MOSCOW, October 6 (Itar-Tass) -- Russia has a<br />
   fundamental legal base for launching an all-out<br />
   crusade against corruption, Prosecutor-General<br />
   Yuri Chaika told a coordinating conference of the<br />
   chiefs of law enforcement agencies at the PGO<br />
   head office. The conference is reviewing the<br />
   first results of measures taken under the<br />
   national corruption resistance action plan.<br />
<br />
   Chaika said that &quot;over a very brief period of<br />
   time there have been fundamental changes to the<br />
   national legislation - a legal and regulatory<br />
   base has been created and a package of anti-corruption laws adopted.&quot;<br />
<br />
   &quot;All regions have drafted their own programs to<br />
   fight corruption, and each body of state power is<br />
   exerting its own efforts to fight this social ill,&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
   In the first half of this year, Chaika said, six<br />
   thousand criminal cases have been submitted to<br />
   courts and 6,500 persons charged with<br />
   corruption-related crimes put on trial. Courts<br />
   pronounced 4,500 conviction verdicts, 20 percent<br />
   more than in the same period last year.<br />
<br />
   Also, scrutiny of legal and regulatory acts<br />
   identified 22,000 documents and their drafts<br />
   containing 28,000 corruption-breeding factors.<br />
<br />
   At the same time the prosecutor-general believes<br />
   that a qualitatively new level should be sought.<br />
<br />
   &quot;We have the entire set of instruments for this,&quot; he said.<br />

   Russia should reduce civil service numbers, cost - deputy premier<br />
   Interfax<br />
<br />
   Moscow, 6 October: The Russian government intends<br />
   to significantly cut down the number of civil<br />
   servants and expenditure on state administration,<br />
   Russian Deputy Prime Minister Sergey Sobyanin has said.<br />
<br />
   &quot;This year the number of civil servants should be<br />
   considerably reduced as well as the cost of state<br />
   administration both in the centre and the<br />
   regions,&quot; Sobyanin told a coordination meeting on<br />
   the fight against corruption at the Russian Prosecutor-General's Office.<br />
<br />
   Despite the economic crisis the number of civil<br />
   servants continues to increase, he said. &quot;On the<br />
   whole, expenditure on civil servants around the<br />
   country has considerably increased in recent<br />
   years, including expenditure on state<br />
   administration, almost by 30 per cent. Moreover,<br />
   part of the expenses significantly exceeded the<br />
   norms set by the budget,&quot; he added.<br />
<br />
   He also said that in 2008 there were 172 civil<br />
   servants per 10,000 people in Russia, or 11 per cent more than in 2007.<br />

   ROAR: a**Society should help the state to fight corruptiona**<br />
<br />
   Corruption is rather a problem of mindset than of<br />
   economic realities, analysts think.<br />
<br />
   On October 7, the State Duma is considering the<br />
   problem of corruption in Russia. Although more<br />
   than 6,000 criminal cases in this sphere have<br />
   been initiated in Russia since the beginning of<br />
   2009, many politicians and analysts recognize<br />
   that the fight against corruption has not been successful so far.<br />
<br />
   A year has passed since President Dmitry Medvedev<br />
   began the fight against corruption, the media<br />
   note. A package of anti-corruption laws was<br />
   submitted to the parliament in October 2008 as<br />
   part of a**the national anti-corruption plana**<br />
   initiated by the president in summer that year.<br />
<br />
   a**The activities of law enforcement agencies in<br />
   fighting corruption have increased over the<br />
   year,a** Vedomosti daily wrote in an editorial. The<br />
   number of criminal cases and exposed violations<br />
   of anti-corruption laws have increased, Vedomosti<br />
   added. But the fight against corruption is going<br />
   on inside the officialsa** machinery, the paper<br />
   said. There is no a**real control from society and media,a** the daily<br />
   added.<br />
<br />
   According to the Interior Ministrya**s Economic<br />
   Security Department, the size of the average<br />
   bribe in Russia tripled in the first half of 2009<br />
   compared to the same period of the previous year.<br />
   The number of exposed bribes had grown 15% to<br />
   24,000. The bulk of them involve small bribes.<br />
<br />
   The number of lawsuits regarding corruption<br />
   increased 20% in the first half of 2009 compared<br />
   to the same period of 2008, Prosecutor General<br />
   Yury Chaika said on the eve of the hearings in<br />
   the State Duma. The pace of the fight is a**not<br />
   bad,a** he said, but added that the work of law<br />
   enforcement agencies may be improved.<br />
<br />
   a**We have a mixed situation in fighting<br />
   corruption,a** Sergey Mikheev, vice president of<br />
   the Center for Political Technologies, believes.<br />
   a**On the one hand, if we speak about statistics,<br />
   it is probably improving,a** he said. a**Many<br />
   officials will show figures about more criminal<br />
   cases as a proof that the fight against<br />
   corruption is in full swing,a** the analysts added.<br />
<br />
   a**On the other hand, if we consider this social<br />
   phenomenon as a whole, the situation does not<br />
   seem to be changing for the better,a** Mikheev told<br />
   RT. a**In a number of cases, it is even deteriorating,a** he added.<br />
<br />
   This shows that corruption has deep roots in<br />
   society, the analyst said. One could say that it<br />
   is rather a**a problem of mindset than of economic realities,a** he<br />
   stressed.<br />
<br />
   a**Unfortunately, in the 1990s and in the last few<br />
   years many officials began considering their jobs<br />
   as a means of solving their own problems,a**<br />
   Mikheev said. Yelena Panfilova, head of<br />
   Transparency Internationala**s Center for<br />
   Anti-Corruption Research in Russia, concurred.<br />
   Corrupt officials may decide to take a**as many<br />
   bribes as possible while they still can,a** she told RBC daily.<br />
<br />
   Mikheev, in turn, explains this by a**the low<br />
   quality of the elite, including state officials.<br />
   And this mindset is expanding beyond state organs<br />
   of power.a** Corruption is widespread in business,<br />
   inside many corporations, in other spheres of life, he added.<br />
<br />
   Many countries fight corruption, and their<br />
   experience shows that this problem cannot be<br />
   solved completely, Mikheev noted. The task is to<br />
   limit corruption, he said. The analyst warned<br />
   that it was senseless to wait for quick results.<br />
   a**Such expectations are a problem themselves,a** he added.<br />
<br />
   Russian President Dmitry Medvedev has made the<br />
   fight against corruption a priority of his<br />
   presidency. But Mikheev fears that the real fight<br />
   against corruption may be replaced by a**another<br />
   campaign with officials announcing quick results.a**<br />
<br />
   a**It is a job for years and one presidential term<br />
   for this will not be enough,a** he told RT.<br />
<br />
   There should be a complex approach to solving<br />
   this problem, the analyst said. It should start<br />
   when children are brought up, he added. a**Peoplea**s<br />
   mindset should be changed, not only economic<br />
   mechanisms or management,a** Mikheev stressed.<br />
<br />
   Pavel Salin, analyst at the Center for Political<br />
   Conjuncture, also believes that the situation has deteriorated in recent<br />
   years.<br />
<br />
   It is not explained by the fact that in the 1990s<br />
   the power was a**more humane.a** a**Rather, the inertia<br />
   of the Soviet social system still existed then,a**<br />
   he told during an online conference at Finam.ru website.<br />
<br />
   a**By the beginning of a new century this system<br />
   had become exhausted,a** he said. At the same time,<br />
   peoplea**s earnings increased, and they began to give bigger bribes, he<br />
   added.<br />
<br />
   There is a nexus of system problems that prevent<br />
   achieving good results in fighting corruption,<br />
   Salin wrote at Actual Comments online magazine.<br />
   Those who take bribes got used to the fact that<br />
   there are only conversations about the fight<br />
   against corruption, not real actions. a**Meanwhile,<br />
   honest officials see how their a**more successfula**<br />
   colleagues live and, being convinced of their<br />
   impunity, begin to take bribes themselves,a** Salin said.<br />
<br />
   According to a survey conducted by Profi Online<br />
   Research polling center in August, 70% of<br />
   respondents said they were ready to stop giving<br />
   or taking bribes if they could achieve results by different methods.<br />
<br />
   However, 14% of those surveyed said they would<br />
   continue to bribe because it would help to get<br />
   desired results. Another poll conducted by<br />
   national pollster VTsIOM in April showed that 58%<br />
   of respondents consider corruption a**invincible.a**<br />
<br />
   a**One should understand that fighting corruption<br />
   is a process that will never lead to a decisive<br />
   victory, but might considerably reduce its<br />
   level,a** Salin said. a**It is impossible even under<br />
   a**good lawsa** to defeat corruption in a week or by<br />
   the New Year, because it is a permanent fight,a** he added.<br />
<br />
   Panfilova of Transparency Internationala**s Center<br />
   for Anti-Corruption Research stressed that now<br />
   the law-enforcement agencies, a**forced by the<br />
   president to act, have to demonstrate results and<br />
   do what they had not done before.a**<br />
<br />
   a**More or less reliable data is now being reported<br />
   to the public,a** she told RBC daily.<br />
<br />
   The role of society, non-governmental<br />
   organizations and the media in the fight against<br />
   corruption is increasing now, Aleksandr Brod,<br />
   head of the Moscow Bureau on Human Rights and a<br />
   member of the Public Chamber, said.<br />
<br />
   Speaking at the Strategy-2020 forum held recently<br />
   in Blagoveshchensk, Brod said that it would be<br />
   possible to achieve results only if public has<br />
   more possibilities to oversee the activities of the state in this sphere.<br />

   GUUS THE CZAR<br />
   VOTERS SUGGEST FOREIGNERS FOR REGIONAL ADMINISTRATIONS<br />
   Author: Andrei Serenko<br />
   [Ineptness of the administrative-political establishment results<br />
   in appearance of new and exotic views on administrative<br />
   practices.]<br />
<br />
         A woman from near Volgograd announced the other day that<br />
   Russia needed foreigners for regional leaders. &quot;Our regional<br />
   officials here are corrupt. Their own interests and affairs are<br />
   all they care for. They cannot remedy the situation,&quot; the<br />
   desperate woman said. &quot;The Volgograd region - and others too, I<br />
   reckon - needs a Guus Hiddink, a young and energetic foreigner<br />
   with undeniable administrative savvy.&quot;<br />
         Opinion polls conducted in the Volgograd region inevitably<br />
   indicate a fairly low level of trust in the regional authorities<br />
   compensated for by sky-high ratings of the president and the<br />
   premier. Like the Russians elsewhere, Volgograd residents pin all<br />
   hopes on the federal center. To a certain degree, Dmitry<br />
   Medvedev's and Vladimir Putin's unprecedented ratings have always<br />
   been a corollary of &quot;devaluation of trust&quot; in local administrative<br />
   and political elites. The statement made by the woman in<br />
   Volgograd, however, indicates that public opinion in Russian<br />
   provinces is developing some new and unorthodox views on<br />
   socioeconomic modernization of regions. Instead of suggesting to<br />
   modernize United Russia or bureaucracy which is part of the so<br />
   called power vertical, the population suggests foreign<br />
   administrators and managers.<br />
         Back to the Varangian era?<br />
         First, it is historically typical of the Russians to rely on<br />
   foreigners to come and bring order with them. &quot;Our land is<br />
   affluent, but order is one thing that is lacking. Come and rule<br />
   us.&quot; Residents of Novgorod made this offer to Varangian princes<br />
   over 1,000 years ago. It seems that the offer still stands.<br />
         Second, social demand for &quot;the new Varangians&quot; is born of the<br />
   news of successful and efficient sports managers like Hiddink in<br />
   Russian football. Hiddink's phenomenon became an element of the<br />
   official propaganda that formed the image of a successful foreign<br />
   manager as an integral part of social success. No wonder the<br />
   population associates social success with foreigners (again, like<br />
   Hiddink the head coach) and not with United Russia leaders.<br />
         Third, there are purely local reasons for the Volgograd<br />
   population to be interested in foreign administrators'<br />
   accomplishments. It is in one of the districts near Volgograd that<br />
   one Joaqim Krima of Guinea-Bissau is running for the local<br />
   parliament. Krima's decision to run for the legislature became hot<br />
   news. The so called protest electorate is rallied behind Krima.<br />
   His campaign has already reanimated the so called Varangian<br />
   complex. However Krima's campaign ends now, voters are already<br />
   pondering promotion of foreigners to positions of power in<br />
   regional administrations.<br />
         The crisis seriously discredited the existing administrative-<br />
   political establishment. The least efficient the elite, the<br />
   broader the gap between bureaucracy and the people. The broader<br />
   the gap, the more energetically the people will look for someone<br />
   or something to replace bureaucracy with. The idea of making<br />
   foreigners governors will keep gaining popularity. There have been<br />
   precedents in Russian history, after all.<br />

   Half of Russians See No Changes in Governors'<br />
   Work After Abolishment of Gubernatorial Elections - Poll<br />
<br />
   MOSCOW. Oct 6 (Interfax) - About half of Russians<br />
   are of the view that the transition from<br />
   gubernatorial elections in Russian regions to the<br />
   actual appointment of governors has not affected<br />
   either the efficiency of their work or their<br />
   feeling of responsibility to the people living in<br />
   their regions, a poll conducted by the VTsIOM<br />
   public opinion survey center showed.<br />
<br />
   In the view of 51% of those polled, the activity<br />
   of governors after their direct elections were<br />
   abolished has not changed, and &quot;the regional<br />
   authorities are working as they did before,&quot;<br />
   according to the poll, whose results were announced on Tuesday.<br />
<br />
   About 21% of those polled suggested that the<br />
   governors are now working more efficiently than<br />
   before, and 12% are of the opposite view.<br />
<br />
   The poll also showed that 23% of the respondents<br />
   believe that the level of the governors' social<br />
   responsibility has increased after the<br />
   abolishment of their direct elections, while 11%<br />
   believe this level has decreased.<br />
<br />
   Nearly half of those polled - 49% - have not seen<br />
   significant changes in the level of the<br />
   governors' responsibility to the people in their regions.<br />

   ANOTHER CONFIRMATION<br />
   VLADIMIR PUTIN WOULD NOT GIVE PROMISES HE CANNOT KEEP - EVEN TO UP HIS<br />
   RATING<br />
   Author: editorial<br />
   [Designed to up the rating of the ruling party and its leader,<br />
   United Russia public receptions turned out to be a failure.]<br />
<br />
         Premier Vladimir Putin visited one of his public receptions<br />
   the other day. The Russians are encouraged to go to these public<br />
   receptions or call centers with their problems. And go there they<br />
   do - with complaints against performance of public works<br />
   departments and countless other problems. United Russia leader<br />
   attentively listened to all complainants who happened to visit the<br />
   reception that day, jotted down details, and promised to see what<br />
   he could do.<br />
         United Russia functionaries admit that productive action in<br />
   connection with absolutely all complaints and pleas is not always<br />
   possible. According to official data from the United Russia<br />
   leader's public reception in Vladimir, only 22% supplicants had<br />
   their requests granted and complaints acted upon.<br />
         It means that 78% or all the rest found their hopes crushed.<br />
   In other words, it is not to Putin's public receptions that they<br />
   will probably appeal next time.<br />
         The conclusion is as follows: thought up and established to<br />
   improve party life and its repute, public receptions inevitably<br />
   lead the ruling party to the loss of both. Smears on the image of<br />
   United Russia are nothing to lose any sleep over, but smears on<br />
   the image of its leader are a different matter altogether. The<br />
   impression is that when it was establishing public receptions<br />
   throughout the country with much pomp, United Russia never even<br />
   thought that it might come to that.<br />
         It is already rumored that whoever invented public receptions<br />
   in the first place are now looking for an excuse to shut them<br />
   down. Or, at least, to stick some other name to them.<br />
         However elegantly they might try to cloth it, the decision to<br />
   shut down public receptions will inevitably affect United Russia's<br />
   rating. Their abolition will be tantamount to admission of defeat.<br />
   Leaving things are they are, on the other hand, may cost the<br />
   ruling party leader all of his rating in time for the 2012<br />
   election.<br />
         There is, however, another angle to look at the problem from.<br />
   One might fancy Putin making promises to whoever asks for help -<br />
   and really keeping his promises. That it is going to be extremely<br />
   costly goes without saying but surely the rating is worth the<br />
   expense. It seems, however, that Putin dislikes this populism. He<br />
   has chosen another option, more demanding but also more honest.<br />
   Instead of making wild promises, he merely shows that he takes his<br />
   party responsibilities seriously. And rationally. After all, not<br />
   even the Lord himself answers every prayer.<br />
         It is on this rationale that Putin relies in terms of the<br />
   forthcoming election of the president. Election where he will<br />
   apparently participate in.<br />

   Opposition despairs as Moscow 'tightens the screws'<br />
   By Conor Humphries<br />
   October 7, 2009<br />
<br />
   MOSCOW (Reuters) - Two leading opposition figures<br />
   say they have given up on Russia's election<br />
   system altogether ahead of regional polls on<br />
   Sunday, saying it makes a mockery of President<br />
   Dmitry Medvedev's pledge to boost democracy.<br />
<br />
   Former prime minister Mikhail Kasyanov and former<br />
   KGB spy Alexander Lebedev, now a banking and<br />
   media tycoon, told Reuters that the campaign for<br />
   Moscow city council elections had helped convince<br />
   them it no longer made sense to run for office.<br />
<br />
   Some 30 million Russians are due to vote on<br />
   Sunday in a series of regional elections, but the<br />
   focus will be on Moscow, where the capital is<br />
   holding its first polls since Medvedev came to power in May last year.<br />
<br />
   &quot;In all of the last 10 years they have tightened<br />
   the screws and the last year is no different,&quot;<br />
   said Ilya Yashin, one of a dozen opposition<br />
   figures denied registration as independents. &quot;The<br />
   political stage has been cleared.&quot;<br />
<br />
   Kremlin officials say that nobody wants to<br />
   support the opposition because it has failed to<br />
   offer voters a convincing alternative to successful government policies.<br />
<br />
   Opinion polls predict the pro-Western opposition<br />
   will lose the last of its seats on the Moscow<br />
   council, which controls a $40 billion budget. It<br />
   also has the power to approve or veto Kremlin<br />
   appointees as Moscow's mayor, a position held since 1992 by Yuri Luzhkov.<br />
<br />
   &quot;In Soviet times elections were decorations, now<br />
   they are imitations,&quot; said Sergei Mitrokhin,<br />
   leader of the Yabloko party, the only pro-Western<br />
   opposition group standing in Moscow. &quot;In Russia<br />
   every election is worse than the one before.&quot;<br />
<br />
   KREMLIN PLEDGE<br />
<br />
   Medvedev has pledged to strengthen Russian<br />
   democracy, which critics say was undermined by<br />
   his predecessor Vladimir Putin, now prime<br />
   minister. But the opposition says the situation<br />
   has deteriorated since Medvedev came to power in May 2008.<br />
<br />
   &quot;New democratic times are beginning,&quot; Medvedev<br />
   said in August, promising to break the<br />
   near-monopoly of ruling party United Russia over<br />
   the political system -- something which has not happened.<br />
<br />
   Six parties are registered for Sunday's Moscow<br />
   vote, but the only posters in the city are for<br />
   United Russia and the central electoral<br />
   commission, which use similar colours and fonts.<br />
<br />
   Sixty-two percent of Muscovites polled by the<br />
   Levada centre described the vote as &quot;simply an<br />
   imitation of a battle&quot; and said they expected the<br />
   seats to be distributed by the authorities.<br />
<br />
   &quot;There's no one to choose from,&quot; said 30-year-old<br />
   bank worker Ira Gaidarova, who vowed not to vote.<br />
<br />
   The Kremlin blamed local officials, saying it had<br />
   failed to convince Luzhkov, a prominent member of<br />
   the ruling party, to liberalise Moscow elections.<br />
<br />
   &quot;Moscow authorities are not ready to live under<br />
   new standards,&quot; Medvedev's chief spokeswoman<br />
   Natalya Timakova told reporters this week. &quot;We will continue encouraging<br />
   them.&quot;<br />
<br />
   Alexander Lebedev, a banking entrepreneur and<br />
   owner of Russia's main opposition newspaper<br />
   Novaya Gazeta, said the opposition was &quot;weak and<br />
   demoralised&quot; after a year under Medvedev.<br />
<br />
   A series of poorly attended but high-profile<br />
   opposition marches in 2007 were broken up by<br />
   police, but demonstrations have been subdued<br />
   since the pro-Western opposition lost its last<br />
   seats in parliament in elections that year.<br />
   Lebedev ran against Luzhkov in elections for<br />
   Moscow mayor in 2003 and spent a few years as a<br />
   pro-government deputy before leaving and setting up a new opposition<br />
   movement.<br />
<br />
   He said the rejection of his registration in an<br />
   election in April this year for the mayor of 2014<br />
   Winter Olympic host city Sochi helped convince<br />
   him to give up his electoral ambitions.<br />
<br />
   &quot;Sochi was the last piece of evidence that the<br />
   electoral system in this country has evaporated<br />
   for any independent politician,&quot; he said. &quot;There<br />
   is no election. This is just Luzhkov appointing people.&quot;<br />
<br />
   Kasyanov, who failed in his bid to stand against<br />
   Medvedev in 2008, said he came to the conclusion<br />
   that participation in elections was &quot;simply<br />
   impossible&quot; when authorities blocked a dozen<br />
   independent candidates he was backing for the Moscow vote.<br />
<br />
   &quot;We have no influence over what is going on at<br />
   all,&quot; he said. &quot;Our work is simply to give<br />
   citizens the possibility of alternative points of view.&quot;<br />

   New Politkovskaya Suspects Unearthed<br />
   By Alexandra Odynova<br />
<br />
   Investigators have identified new suspects in the<br />
   2006 killing of Novaya Gazeta reporter Anna<br />
   Politkovskaya, the newspapera**s deputy editor said Tuesday.<br />
<br />
   The suspected triggerman, meanwhile, evaded<br />
   capture in April and is traveling in Europe, the<br />
   editor, Sergei Sokolov, said at a news conference.<br />
<br />
   Wednesday marks the third anniversary of<br />
   Politkovskayaa**s death, which stirred Western<br />
   outrage and raised new fears about media freedom<br />
   in Russia. A Paris-based media watchdog<br />
   complained of state interference when its<br />
   representatives failed to receive Russian visas<br />
   to attend events commemorating the killing.<br />
<br />
   Politkovskaya, an investigative reporter who<br />
   exposed abuses in Chechnya and was critical of<br />
   the Kremlin, was shot dead in her Moscow apartment building on Oct. 7,<br />
   2006.<br />
<br />
   No one has been convicted in her death. Three men<br />
   accused of being accomplices were cleared in a<br />
   jury trial in February. The Supreme Court<br />
   overturned the verdict in June and ordered a<br />
   retrial in September. But the start of the<br />
   retrial was indefinitely postponed at the<br />
   insistence of Politkovskayaa**s adult children, who<br />
   believe that the initial investigation was<br />
   carried out poorly. The case has been sent back to prosecutors.<br />
<br />
   Investigators have failed to identify the<br />
   organizers of the murder, and a fourth suspect,<br />
   Rustam Makhmudov, who is believed to have pulled the trigger, remains at<br />
   large.<br />
<br />
   a**The killer could have been arrested in April but<br />
   managed to escape,a** Sokolov told reporters.<br />
<br />
   He said he was aware that the killer was in<br />
   Europe, traveling from one country to another.<br />
<br />
   Novaya Gazeta has been conducting an independent<br />
   investigation into the killing and has been cooperating with the<br />
   authorities.<br />
<br />
   Sokolov said investigators have identified new<br />
   people who might have been involved in the<br />
   killing, but their names cannot be disclosed yet<br />
   because the investigation is ongoing.<br />
<br />
   He said the newspapera**s investigation suggested<br />
   that the three suspects who were acquitted in<br />
   February were involved in the killing, as well as<br />
   several people in the security forces.<br />
<br />
   Two representatives of Reporters Without Borders<br />
   were supposed to attend the news conference<br />
   Tuesday but failed to obtain Russian visas.<br />
<br />
   The groupa**s head, Jean-FranAS:ois Julliard, accused<br />
   the Russian authorities of meddling, a charge that they denied.<br />
<br />
   a**It was extremely important for us to be in<br />
   Russia alongside Anna Politkovskayaa**s colleagues<br />
   and family on the third anniversary of her<br />
   murder,a** Julliard said in an e-mailed statement.<br />
   a**Moscow does not want us to address the Russians<br />
   directly. But we will not give up.a**<br />
<br />
   A spokesman for the Russian Embassy in Paris,<br />
   Andrei Kleimenov, said the visa denials had no political motivations.<br />
<br />
   a**There is no politics. They didna**t get their<br />
   visas because the papers were incorrectly filled out,a** Kleimenov told<br />
   Interfax.<br />
<br />
   Kleimenov didna**t elaborate on what was wrong with<br />
   the two representativesa** application forms.<br />
<br />
   A Foreign Ministry spokesman said the visas were<br />
   denied because of a**some technical reasons.a**<br />
<br />
   He said he did not have further details.<br />
<br />
   n A lawyer for Chechen President Ramzan Kadyrov,<br />
   who won a defamation lawsuit against Memorial<br />
   human rights leader Oleg Orlov on Tuesday, said<br />
   Kadyrov would file a defamation lawsuit against<br />
   Novaya Gazeta editor-in-chief Dmitry Muratov and<br />
   several of the newspapera**s journalists.<br />
<br />
   Novaya Gazeta, known for its critical<br />
   investigative stories about Chechnya, said in a<br />
   statement that a**there was nothing to comment on yet.a**<br />

   Politkovskaya's family denies new suspects in murder case<br />
<br />
   MOSCOW, October 7 (RIA Novosti) - A lawyer acting<br />
   for the family of the late Russian journalist<br />
   Anna Politkovskaya denied on Wednesday reports<br />
   that new suspects have emerged in the 2006 murder case.<br />
<br />
   &quot;We do not have information that charges have<br />
   been brought against new people, they would have<br />
   informed us of that, under the law,&quot; Anna Stavitskaya said.<br />
<br />
   The chief editor of the Novaya Gazeta newspaper<br />
   where the investigative journalist worked said on<br />
   Tuesday that &quot;new figures have appeared in the<br />
   field of vision of police,&quot; adding that their<br />
   names have never previously been mentioned in the<br />
   media in connection with the murder.<br />
<br />
   In February, a Moscow court acquitted three men<br />
   charged with involvement with the shooting of<br />
   Politkovskaya in her Moscow apartment building,<br />
   but the Supreme Court overturned the ruling and ordered a retrial.<br />
<br />
   Politkovskaya was internationally known for her<br />
   reporting of atrocities against civilians in the<br />
   troubled North Caucasus republic of Chechnya.<br />

   Chances of finding Politkovskaya killers fade<br />
<br />
   Three years after Russian journalist Anna<br />
   Politkovskayaa**s murder, her killers are still at<br />
   large. A fresh inquiry has been ordered, but<br />
   Politkovskayaa**s family say the chances of finding those responsible are<br />
   fading.<br />
<br />
   Since that dark afternoon three years ago, Anna's<br />
   children have learned how to live without their<br />
   mother. Her son has hurled himself into work. Her<br />
   daughter has become a mother herself. They are<br />
   still campaigning for a fair trial, but quite<br />
   aware that time is playing against them.<br />
<br />
   a**Our family is starting to lose hope that all<br />
   those involved in this crime will be found and<br />
   brought to justice,a** says Vera Politkovskaya,<br />
   daughter of Anna Politkovskaya. a**Time is passing<br />
   by and, with it, our chances of finding those responsible.a**<br />
<br />
   The men charged with assisting Politkovskaya's<br />
   killers are about the same age as her children.<br />
   The Makhmudov brothers have already stood trial<br />
   and been found not guilty by a jury. They're<br />
   about to face the same charges again after higher<br />
   courts ordered a new hearing and launched an<br />
   additional probe into the murder. But for<br />
   Politkovskaya's family and friends this is not good enough.<br />
<br />
   a**Even if a new trial delivers a guilty verdict<br />
   based on the same charges and the same evidence<br />
   as in the first trial a** of course we wona**t be<br />
   satisfied,a** says Ilya Politkovsky, son of Anna Politkovskaya.<br />
<br />
   a**None of us could be satisfied until not only the<br />
   executioners, but also the masterminds of this<br />
   crime are in the dock,a** says Sergey Sokolov,<br />
   editor-in-chief of Novaya Gazeta, where<br />
   Politkovskaya worked. Earlier he said that the<br />
   renewed investigation into the murder of Russian<br />
   journalist Anna Politkovskaya now involves new suspects.<br />
<br />
   Yet it's the masterminds who've yet to be<br />
   identified. This was one of many question-marks<br />
   in the investigation that many, including<br />
   Politkovskayaa**s family, criticized as flawed. A<br />
   charge the chief investigator refuses to accept.<br />
<br />
   a**The not-guilty verdict in the first trial was a<br />
   result of several factors. Jury trials in Russia<br />
   are a relatively new institution that cannot<br />
   always provide for the isolation of jurors a** so<br />
   they are not prevented from contacts with<br />
   defendantsa** friends and family,a** Petros Gariyan,<br />
   senior investigator in Politkovskayaa**s case said on 12 March.<br />
<br />
   In the office of Novaya Gazeta where Anna<br />
   Politkovskaya worked as a special correspondent,<br />
   her desk still stands empty. Since<br />
   Politkovskaya's murder, two more of the<br />
   newspaper's contributors have been killed. As a<br />
   result, the newspaper has consciously curtailed<br />
   its coverage of the North Caucuses.<br />
<br />
   a**We will be following news in Chechnya but we no<br />
   longer want to have reporters on the ground. We<br />
   dona**t want to risk their lives,a** says Sergei Sokolov.<br />
<br />
   Yet, it doesna**t mean that Russian journalists no<br />
   longer have a taste for risky stories. Elena is<br />
   22. She also works for Novaya Gazeta. It was<br />
   Politkovskayaa**s coverage of Chechnya that inspired her to become a<br />
   journalist.<br />
<br />
   a**We could talk a lot about what a great writer<br />
   she was, but for me her most striking quality was<br />
   that she was never ignorant. She always took<br />
   human suffering close to her heart,a** says Elena<br />
   Kostyuchenko, Novaya Gazeta reporter.<br />
<br />
   While Politkovskaya was often the last hope for<br />
   those who lost faith in justice, it's now her own<br />
   family struggling to sustain their trust in the law.<br />
<br />
   Ita**s no secret that some of Anna Politkovskayaa**s<br />
   critical stories were not appreciated by the<br />
   Russian authorities. And while there is still a<br />
   question as to whether this was a reason behind<br />
   her murder, her family and friends say ita**s the<br />
   reason why her death should be fully investigated and accounted for.<br />

   UNITED RUSSIA DEFENDS OURS MOVEMENT...from the<br />
   presidential Council for Human Rights<br />
   UNITED RUSSIA FUNCTIONARIES CRITICIZE ELLA PAMFILOVA<br />
   Author: Viktor Khamrayev, Irina Granik<br />
   [Scandal in the establishment: the ruling party vs a presidential<br />
   structure.]<br />
<br />
         Ella Pamfilova of the presidential Council for Human Rights<br />
   and Civil Society called Ours Movement pickets in front of<br />
   Alexander Podrabinek's house &quot;harassment&quot;. (Everything began a<br />
   week ago with the Soviet dissenter's piece in Yezhednevny<br />
   Zhurnal.) Pamfilova appealed to law enforcement agencies to<br />
   examine Ours action for possible violation of the acting<br />
   legislation.<br />
         United Russia reciprocated with stiffly-worded criticism of<br />
   Pamfilova. Andrei Isayev, Senior Assistant Secretary of United<br />
   Russia General Council, announced in no uncertain terms that<br />
   &quot;[Ours Movement] activists have as many rights to expression of<br />
   their position by legitimate means as Podrabinek himself does.&quot;<br />
   Isayev appraised Pamfilova's statement as &quot;an attempt to establish<br />
   censorship... in favor of certain privileged human rights<br />
   activists&quot;.<br />
         &quot;Are we supposed to let scoundrels be?&quot; said Valery<br />
   Ryazansky, assistant leader of United Russia faction and<br />
   Journalistic Union Chairman.<br />
         What particularly irks the ruling party is that it was<br />
   Pamfilova who came to the journalist's help. &quot;Like they were<br />
   friends and associates of old,&quot; Ryazansky said and immediately<br />
   added that &quot;friends such as these have nothing to do in Russia.&quot;<br />
         Franz Klintsevich, United Russia functionary and Afghani War<br />
   Veterans Union leader, plainly suggested an appeal to the<br />
   president to chuck Pamfilova out.<br />
         Criticism of a presidential structure by United Russia is<br />
   something unusual indeed. On the other hand, it is not United<br />
   Russia leaders who have been making statements so far. Unless it<br />
   is leaders themselves who speak up, things are always left as they<br />
   are. Last summer, Isayev mounted a one-man crusade for expulsion<br />
   from the party of Bashkir President Murtaza Rakhimov. (Isayev was<br />
   enraged by Rakhimov scathing criticism of the ruling party and all<br />
   of the political system in Russia in an interview with Moskovsky<br />
   Komsomolets.) For all Isayev's efforts, Rakhimov was never even<br />
   disciplined, much less expelled from United Russia.<br />
         A Presidential Administration official told this newspaper<br />
   that &quot;... every political party may offer recommendations to the<br />
   president&quot; concerning candidates for chairmen of state structures<br />
   including the presidential Council for Human Rights and Civil<br />
   Society. &quot;Anyway, choosing personnel for these positions is the<br />
   president's own prerogative. Besides, the president does not<br />
   belong to any political party,&quot; the official said.<br />
         As for Pamfilova, she announced that this is what the Council<br />
   itself was for - &quot;... to make sure that the minority, i.e. human<br />
   rights activists disliked in society serves as link between the<br />
   president and the people who think differently from the majority.&quot;<br />
   Pamfilova denounced the implication that Podrabinek and she were<br />
   &quot;friends&quot; because Podrabinek had regularly insulted her and other<br />
   Council members by calling them &quot;Kremlin's clowns&quot;. Anyway, the<br />
   Council made the statement it did because it suspected that the<br />
   protests taking place in front of Podrabinek's house were more<br />
   than &quot;just a harmless picket&quot;. Pamfilova therefore asked United<br />
   Russia functionaries to stop &quot;dragging veterans into the scandal&quot;<br />
   and reminded Ours Movement activists that they could have gone to<br />
   law against the journalist.<br />
         &quot;Did she expect these youths to go to law, initiate a trial<br />
   that might take nobody knows how long, and patiently wait for the<br />
   trial to end?&quot; Ryazansky commented. &quot;They did the right thing and<br />
   organized this radical action to force Podrabinek to apologize.&quot;<br />
         Pamfilova in her turn announced that Ours Movement activists<br />
   were fighting nonconformity and that it would certainly backfire<br />
   one fine day.<br />

   One Russia demands resignation of prominent rights champion<br />
   Interfax<br />
<br />
   Moscow, 6 October: Ella Pamfilova, head of the<br />
   Council for Promoting the Development of the<br />
   Institutions of Civil Society and Human Rights<br />
   under the Russian president, has said she is not<br />
   afraid of threats from One Russia, which is demanding her resignation.<br />
<br />
   &quot;I am a strong person, I have been persecuted on<br />
   more than one occasion and, no doubt, I will<br />
   survive this one. But not everyone is that strong<br />
   and not everyone can do this. I sympathize with<br />
   those who for different reasons can't cope with<br />
   this persecution,&quot; Pamfilova said on Ekho Moskvy<br />
   radio station on Tuesday (6 October).<br />
<br />
   Yesterday Pamfilova criticized the actions of the<br />
   Nashi (pro-Kremlin youth) movement against<br />
   journalist Aleksandr Podrabinek, who, in their<br />
   opinion, in his article &quot;As an anti-Soviet to<br />
   anti-Soviets&quot; insulted war veterans.<br />
<br />
   In response, One Russia said today it intended to<br />
   ask President Dmitriy Medvedev to remove Ella Pamfilova from her post.<br />
<br />
   Commenting on One Russia's plans on Tuesday,<br />
   Pamfilova said: &quot;They are changing the accents<br />
   once again. It is not about the essence or the<br />
   meaning of the article (by Aleksandr Podrabinek)<br />
   with which, like any normal person, I do not<br />
   agree - the point is that a person cannot be persecuted for this article.&quot;<br />
<br />
   She said Podrabinek had the right to express his<br />
   opinion and be responsible for it, but exclusively in the legal framework.<br />
<br />
   As has been reported, on Tuesday One Russia<br />
   stated its intention to demand Pamfilova's<br />
   resignation. &quot;Tomorrow at a sitting of the<br />
   central council of the One Russia party we intend<br />
   to raise with the leadership of our party the<br />
   question that we need to approach the president<br />
   with the demand to dismiss Pamfilova,&quot; Frants<br />
   Klintsevich, State Duma deputy, chairman of the<br />
   council and leader of the Russian union of Afghan<br />
   veterans, told Interfax on Tuesday.<br />
<br />
   He also said that he intended to demand that<br />
   Pamfilova should apologise to the veterans of the<br />
   Great Patriotic War (1941-1945) whom, in his<br />
   opinion, she &quot;deeply and absolutely undeservedly insulted&quot;.<br />
<br />
   According to Klintsevich, the reason for being<br />
   unhappy with Pamfilova lies in the fact that she<br />
   &quot;in fact sided with journalist Aleksandr<br />
   Podrabinek, who posted on the internet an article<br />
   which caused a lot of controversy&quot;. &quot;Mrs<br />
   Pamfilova expressed a view along the lines that<br />
   there are no more worthy veterans of the Great<br />
   Patriotic War left in the country and those who<br />
   are still alive had been 'prison guards',&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
   According to Klintsevich, in her statement<br />
   Pamfilova &quot;in fact expresses support for those<br />
   who at present not just openly insult veterans<br />
   but call for a revision of the whole history of the country&quot;.<br />
<br />
   Klintsevich supported the Nashi activists, who<br />
   have been holding a protest outside the house<br />
   where Podrabinek and his family live, and said<br />
   that the public movement of veterans of military<br />
   action in Afghanistan which he chaired had also made a statement on this<br />
   issue.<br />
<br />
   For his part, Andrey Isayev, first deputy<br />
   secretary of the presidium of the General Council<br />
   of One Russia, has expressed bewilderment in<br />
   connection with Pamfilova's position on Podrabinek's article.<br />
<br />
   &quot;The activists of the Nashi movement have the<br />
   right to express their position by all legal<br />
   means in no lesser degree than Mr Podrabinek. And<br />
   attempts to introduce censorship in favour of<br />
   some privileged 'human rights campaigners' seem<br />
   rather strange. Moreover, Podrabinek's<br />
   pronouncements have been perceived as an insult<br />
   by people who certainly have our respect - war veterans,&quot; Isayev said.<br />
<br />
   In his comment posted on One Russia's official<br />
   website, he criticised Pamfilova's position on<br />
   the &quot;Podrabinek affair&quot;. &quot;Mrs Pamfilova's actions<br />
   are more than strange and I hope she made them<br />
   simply because she does not know what exactly<br />
   Podrabinek said,&quot; Isayev noted. (Passage omitted)<br />

   Vladimir Putin (Russia's president at the time<br />

   a cynical attitude. The reasoning was not<br />
   profound but it was far-stretching. He knows the<br />
   country entrusted to him by chance only too well.<br />
   On a nationwide scale, the country does not need<br />
   Anna Politkovskaya either dead or alive.<br />
<br />
   One very thin strip, a sort of fourth strip on<br />
   the Russian tricolour flag, is still concerned.<br />
   They are still trying to say something, to<br />
   establish something, to remind people of<br />
   something, to prove that Anna Politkovskaya's efforts were worth<br />
   something.<br />
<br />
   The Kremlin did not notice this effort. It was<br />
   like mosquitoes to the Kremlin. You wave them<br />
   away and you carry on going. Putin was right in<br />
   that mosquitoes are only dangerous in large numbers. They killed her.<br />
<br />
   They smashed an annoying mosquito. Who did this?<br />
   God knows. Some investigating still has to be<br />
   done for the sake of it though because otherwise<br />
   the West will go mad with incomprehension.<br />
   They've got nothing better to do in the West.<br />
   This is why a slice of justice is being served<br />
   with the tired face of a Soviet-period service sector worker.<br />
<br />
   In the meantime, someone else gets killed and<br />
   someone else on top of that, someone who was as<br />
   unnecessary as Politkovskaya was. They will<br />
   continue to kill because it has been said at the<br />
   top that this has no significance for the state<br />
   and, how shall I put it, to society. When she was<br />
   alive, she was doing some damage but the killing<br />
   did more damage. Since time has shown that<br />
   Politkovskaya's killing did not slow down the<br />
   nation's glorious progress, this is ok.<br />
<br />
   Three years have passed. Putin has matured. He<br />
   used to be a young heir but he has evolved into<br />
   an eagle, a sort of Mahatma, a man full of wit, a<br />
   person who can express his ideas clearly. Society<br />
   has become inert, reverted to childhood, grown<br />
   simple and calmed down once and for all. This<br />
   means that the president was bang on the trend in<br />
   saying what the majority of Russians wanted to<br />
   hear him say. He did not want to unsettle them in<br />
   the way the rulers of countries which are<br />
   inherently alien to us can do when they defend<br />
   those who irritate the authorities and mourn for them.<br />
<br />
   Vladimir Putin clearly, precisely and haughtily<br />
   told us yes, it is true that we are a cynical,<br />
   pragmatically-minded nation which does not give a<br />
   damn. We are a nation of those who like to be in<br />
   power and if they fail to make it to the top they<br />
   are ready to bow to the authorities, to love them<br />
   fondly and to be at one with them.<br />
<br />
   Certainly, we can feel unsettled if things really<br />
   get to us or if enemies wake us up. In this case<br />
   there is bloodshed and there is fire all over the<br />
   place. Do we want this? No. Therefore, let's go<br />
   to bed and have a good quiet night.<br />

   Amnesty International Urges Russian Govt to<br />
   Protect Journalists, Rights Activists<br />
<br />
   MOSCOW. Oct 6 (Interfax) - The Amnesty<br />
   International human rights organization has<br />
   called on the Russian authorities to take<br />
   effective steps to protect journalists and human<br />
   rights campaigners, as well as to bring persons<br />
   standing behind such crimes to justice.<br />
<br />
   &quot;Three years on from the murder of Anna<br />
   Politkovskaya, the Russian authorities must take<br />
   action to end the attacks against those working<br />
   to protect human rights in the country,&quot; Amnesty<br />
   International said in a letter to Russian<br />
   President Dmitry Medvedev circulated ahead of the<br />
   third anniversary of the killing of Russian<br />
   investigative journalist Anna<br />
   Politkovskaya.       &quot;That those who murdered<br />
   Anna Politkovskaya and ordered her killing remain<br />
   free reflects a failure by the Russian<br />
   authorities to fully investigate such crimes,&quot;<br />
   said Irene Khan, Secretary General of Amnesty International.<br />
<br />
   The international organization also expressed<br />
   concern that &quot;human rights activists in Russia<br />
   and the North Caucasus face increasing violence and intimidation&quot;.<br />
<br />
   &quot;A number of people who have spoken out against<br />
   human rights violations in the country, including<br />
   human rights activists, lawyers and journalists,<br />
   have been killed or faced intimidation, most<br />
   likely as a result of the work they were doing,&quot; Amnesty International<br />
   said.<br />
<br />
   Amnesty International has called on &quot;President<br />
   Medvedev to ensure that all these crimes are<br />
   fully investigated and that those responsible are<br />
   brought to justice in trials that meet international standards&quot;.<br />
<br />
   Politkovskaya, who had Russian and U.S.<br />
   citizenship, was shot dead in the entrance hall<br />
   of her apartment building in Moscow on October 7, 2006.<br />

   Russia's War on Words<br />
   By K. Anthony Appiah<br />
   The writer, a philosophy professor at Princeton<br />
   University, is president of the board of trustees<br />
   of the PEN American Center, the U.S. branch of<br />
   the world's oldest international literary and human rights organization.<br />
<br />
   Three years ago today Anna Politkovskaya, a<br />
   courageous journalist who exposed appalling human<br />
   rights offenses in Chechnya, was shot five times<br />
   as she entered her Moscow apartment building. She<br />
   was not the first Russian journalist to be slain<br />
   for performing the invaluable function of<br />
   bringing buried truths to light. Sadly, there<br />
   have been, and will be, more murders. And we all pay the price.<br />
<br />
   Westerners were inclined to think during the Cold<br />
   War that a democratic Russia would be better for<br />
   Russians and for us. Yet 20 years after the fall<br />
   of the Iron Curtain, hopes for genuine democracy<br />
   in Russia remain unrealized. A major reason is<br />
   the parlous condition of the Russian media.<br />
<br />
   In the United States, an investigative journalist<br />
   who unsettles the powerful can win accolades; in<br />
   Russia, such a journalist can expect to be gunned<br />
   down. A liberal democracy depends on reporters<br />
   who follow the story and publish what they learn.<br />
   It cannot flourish when the pursuit of<br />
   investigative journalism carries an informal death penalty.<br />
<br />
   This year alone has been terrible for the brave<br />
   journalists who are continuing the work for which Politkovskaya gave her<br />
   life.<br />
<br />
   In July the human rights activist Natalya<br />
   Estemirova was kidnapped outside her home in<br />
   Grozny, Chechnya; her bullet-ridden body was<br />
   found hours later in Ingushetia, another of the<br />
   troubled regions of Russia. Last October,<br />
   Estemirova had received the first Anna<br />
   Politkovskaya award from the human rights group Reach All Women in War.<br />
<br />
   In January, Stanislav Markelov, a leading human<br />
   rights attorney and president of the Russian Rule<br />
   of Law Institute, was fatally shot in Moscow as<br />
   he left a news conference he had called to<br />
   protest the release of a Russian officer<br />
   convicted of atrocities in the Chechen war.<br />
   Markelov, a close friend of Estemirova, was known<br />
   for his work representing victims of torture and<br />
   journalists, including Politkovskaya. Anastasia<br />
   Baburova, a student journalist for the<br />
   independent newspaper Novaya Gazeta (which had<br />
   employed Politkovskaya), was also shot and died hours later.<br />
<br />
   It is not only those covering Chechnya who are at<br />
   risk. Last November, Mikhail Beketov, the editor<br />
   of a newspaper in Khimki (northwest of Moscow)<br />
   who had been reporting on local government<br />
   corruption, was beaten nearly to death and then<br />
   left in the freezing cold; he lost a leg and<br />
   fingers to frostbite. In February the editor of a<br />
   local weekly in Solnechnogorsk (further northwest<br />
   of Moscow) was found unconscious and bleeding. He<br />
   had published articles critical of local politicians.<br />
<br />
   Speaking of Anna Politkovskaya in December 2006,<br />
   Estemirova said: &quot;It's extremely clear to me that<br />
   those who killed her thought that they were<br />
   silencing her, but that is not the case. Because<br />
   now in Novaya Gazeta, in the space where her<br />
   articles are published, there is and there will<br />
   be information from Memorial&quot; -- the<br />
   internationally recognized Russian human rights organization.<br />
<br />
   But since Estemirova's murder, Memorial has<br />
   closed its offices in Grozny, and many who worked<br />
   to report human rights abuses have fled the region.<br />
<br />
   There is every reason to believe that the murders<br />
   of these journalists are assassinations:<br />
   politically motivated killings carried out or<br />
   covered up by members of the Russian intelligence<br />
   services, and ignored by a government whose first<br />
   duty is to protect the lives and liberties of<br />
   citizens. Sadly, what Estemirova said about<br />
   Politkovskaya's murder is likely to be true of<br />
   all such killings: &quot;Even if we find out who<br />
   pulled the trigger, the person who gave the order will remain unknown.&quot;<br />
<br />
   Russia no longer needs gulags to silence the<br />
   opposition. The punishment for drawing attention<br />
   to the sins of the mighty used to be a show trial<br />
   and exile, possibly to a labor camp. Now<br />
   journalists receive an anonymous but credible<br />
   threat of violence to themselves or their<br />
   families, a beating on their doorstep or, in some<br />
   cases, execution in broad daylight.<br />
<br />
   Journalists are not the only victims of this<br />
   policy of terror. Russia claims to be a member of<br />
   the global community of democratic nations. But<br />
   democracy is not functioning when citizens are<br />
   denied basic information with which to judge the<br />
   actions of their leaders. We are often told, for<br />
   example, that the Russian government's policies<br />
   in Chechnya are &quot;popular&quot; at home. But can we<br />
   hold Russian citizens responsible for what their<br />
   country does if they do not know what it is<br />
   really doing? Democratic choices made in<br />
   ignorance are not free but fixed. The freedom of<br />
   journalists to report about life in their<br />
   societies is critical, because without it, citizens lose their freedom,<br />
   too.<br />
<br />
   Americans were right to hope that the end of the<br />
   Soviet system would bring rewards for us as well<br />
   as for the people of Russia. But democracy only<br />
   starts at the ballot box. Independent speech is<br />
   crucial. We must do all we can to support<br />
   journalists in this important work, including<br />
   pressuring the Russian government to protect<br />
   reporters and their freedom to speak. The murder<br />
   of journalists affects more than just<br />
   journalists; and the undermining of Russian<br />
   democracy is a problem for more than just Russia.<br />

   Russian rights centre hits at prosecution of<br />
   historian studying 1940s deportees<br />
   Interfax<br />
<br />
   Moscow, 6 October: Human rights campaigners have<br />
   sided with a historian and a policeman in<br />
   Arkhangelsk who are being prosecuted for<br />
   collecting information about German and Polish political prisoners.<br />
<br />
   A criminal case has been initiated against Prof<br />
   Mikhail Suprun, head of a department at Pomorskiy<br />
   State University, and Col Aleksandr Dudarev, head<br />
   of the information centre of the Directorate of Internal Affairs<br />
   (UVD) for Arkhangelsk Region, according to a<br />
   statement issued by Memorial, a historical education and human rights<br />
   centre.<br />
<br />
   According to the rights centre, Prof Suprun is<br />
   being prosecuted for collecting information for a<br />
   database about the Poles and Germans who were<br />
   deported to a special settlement in Arkhangelsk<br />
   Region in the 1940s and Col Dudarev is being<br />
   prosecuted for providing Suprun with this opportunity.<br />
<br />
   &quot;In other words, the first is being prosecuted<br />
   for doing his job and the second for performing<br />
   his duties. The grounds for the prosecution are<br />
   absurd,&quot; says the statement, which Interfax received on Tuesday (6<br />
   October).<br />
<br />
   According to Memorial, the information, which<br />
   employees of Pomorskiy University were<br />
   collecting, using documents from the archive of<br />
   the information centre of the Arkhangelsk UVD, is<br />
   no different from the information available in<br />
   the majority of the Books of Memory for victims<br />
   of political repressions that have been published in Russia.<br />
<br />
   The Memorial statement says that the Books of<br />
   Memory for those who died during the Great<br />
   Patriotic War (1941-1945) and the database of the<br />
   Defence Ministry, which is in the public domain,<br />
   contain many more names - about 10m - and the<br />
   information about the people in them includes not<br />
   just the date of birth and death but many other<br />
   details, such as their residence address before<br />
   they were called up, family details, etc. (Passage omitted)<br />
<br />
   &quot;It is obvious that the accusations are<br />
   groundless,&quot; Memorial says. (Passage omitted)<br />
<br />
   &quot;The Arkhangelsk case is causing particular alarm<br />
   in the context of recent tendencies towards<br />
   embellishing Stalin and keeping silent about the<br />
   crimes of the Communist regime. On the other<br />
   hand, it might be 'just' an acute form of relapse<br />
   into the mania of secrecy inherited from the<br />
   Soviet Union. But this disease is extremely<br />
   dangerous: through the closure of access to<br />
   archives, Russia is being deprived of its history<br />
   and its memory, which are the foundations of the<br />
   national identity,&quot; the statement says.<br />
<br />
   Memorial is a leading independent organization on<br />
   post-Soviet space that deals with the<br />
   rehabilitation of the victims of political repressions in the USSR.<br />

   Future privatization in Russia to occur without discounts, says Putin<br />
   Interfax<br />
   October 6, 2009<br />
<br />
   Russia's next round of privatization will take<br />
   place at market price with no discounts offered,<br />
   Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has said.<br />
   He was speaking at the opening of a meeting<br />
   dedicated to Russia's privatization plans in<br />
   Novo-Ogarevo on 6 October, as reported by Russian<br />
   news agency ITAR-TASS on the same day<br />
<br />
   Putin said that privatization in Russia &quot;must neither be free nor<br />
   privileged&quot;.<br />
<br />
   He went on to say that &quot;federal property must<br />
   only be sold at realistic, market prices, without<br />
   any discounts&quot;, adding that privatization in<br />
   Russia requires the expansion of the private business sector, as well as<br />
   seeing this process as an important source of<br />
   state income. Changing the proprietor should lead<br />
   to industrial effectiveness growth, to attracting<br />
   further investment and improving the competitive<br />
   environment, he was quoted as saying.<br />
<br />
   In a separate development, Interfax news agency<br />
   quoted Putin as saying that &quot;during the economic<br />
   crisis, the government's economic presence has<br />
   significantly increased. However, as the<br />
   acuteness of crisis-related problems goes down,<br />
   as the economy recovers and stable (economic)<br />
   growth returns, we need to have a clear and<br />
   coherent plan on how to handle surplus assets and<br />
   be able to see clearly and precisely what we are<br />
   going to do with so-called federal state unitary enterprises (FGUPs)&quot;.<br />
<br />
   Putin added that FGUPs in part &quot;work exclusively<br />
   as private offices, having profit making as their<br />
   main aim, but while using state property free of charge&quot;.<br />
<br />
   This is the only difference between FGUPs and<br />
   private businesses, he was quoted as saying.<br />
<br />
   Referring to an increase in governmental presence<br />
   in the economy, Putin said that &quot;this was the<br />
   government's natural reaction to the inability,<br />
   at times, of the private sector to independently<br />
   handle problems mounting during the global<br />
   financial and economic crisis&quot;, as well as to<br />
   &quot;the private sector's insistent calls for help to<br />
   the government&quot;, as quoted by Interfax.<br />

   IN CHUBAIS' STEPS<br />
   RUSSIA: PRIVATIZATION ON A MAJOR SCALE IS IN THE OFFING<br />
   Author: Inga Vorobiova, Yelena Grigorieva<br />
   [Up to 5,500 enterprises might go under the hammer in 2010.]<br />
<br />
   The government is out to bring down the rate of participation of<br />
   the state in national economy from 50% to 30%. Thousands of assets<br />
   from federal state unitary enterprises to joint-stock companies to<br />
   airports will be put up for sale. &quot;All of that will go at market<br />
   prices, without any discounts,&quot; Premier Vladimir Putin said.<br />
   Economic Development Minister Elvira Nabiullina added that the<br />
   state intended to sell part of its interest in Rosgosstrakh,<br />
   Rosagroleasing, Rosselkhozbank, and Sovkomflot.<br />
         The Cabinet met in Novo-Ogarevo yesterday to discuss<br />
   privatization. &quot;What with the crisis receding, the state is<br />
   determined to part with surplus assets,&quot; Putin announced.<br />
         The list of enterprises to go under the hammer in 2010 will<br />
   have to be finalized yet. It is only known at this time that the<br />
   initial list has been greatly extended. At first, the government<br />
   had intended to sell 7 billion rubles worth of assets. Yesterday,<br />
   when the conference was over, Nabiullina said that the figure<br />
   would be much greater than that. &quot;We expect the sales to make<br />
   about 70 billion rubles for the budget.&quot;<br />
         Nabiullina said for example that the state intended to sell<br />
   13.1% of is OAO Rosgosstrakh stock (its interest in the company<br />
   currently estimated at 25%). &quot;Yes, we know. They did discuss the<br />
   matter with us,&quot; a source in Rosgosstrakh press service said. &quot;We<br />
   are prepared to buy the stock.&quot;<br />
         Between 20% and 25% of the state interest in Rosagroleasing<br />
   and Rosselkhozbank would be put up for sale too, and so would 20%<br />
   of Sovkomflot stock (in late 2010). According to Nabiullina,<br />
   Sheremetyevo airport would be retained but managed for the state<br />
   by some private company. Nabiullina denied the plans to sell<br />
   Russian Railways, Rosneft, Gazprom Oil, Aeroflot, Sberbank, or<br />
   VTB.<br />
         Deputy Premier Igor Shuvalov said 5,500 enterprises might be<br />
   put up for sale in 2010.<br />
         Deputy Premier and Finance Minister Aleksei Kudrin in his did<br />
   not think that the state would manage to rapidly bring down its<br />
   involvement in economy. &quot;It is currently in the vicinity of 50%,&quot;<br />
   Kudrin said. &quot;To cut it down even to 40%, the state might need at<br />
   least five years.&quot; When that was finally accomplished, the process<br />
   should continue until participation of the state in national<br />
   economy amounted to 30% or so. &quot;No need to be in a hurry. Some<br />
   assets might go next year, some others in a year or two,&quot; Kudrin<br />
   said.<br />

   Pro-Kremlin TV commentator says 'speculators' behind dollar demise<br />
   predictions<br />
   Excerpt from commentator Mikhail Leontyev's<br />
   &quot;Odnako&quot; slot on state-controlled Russian Channel One TV on 6 October<br />
<br />
   (Mikhail Leontyev) For some time now, spreading<br />
   rumours about the imminent demise of the dollar<br />
   has become international fashion. This time the<br />
   rumour, citing banking circles in Hong Kong, has come from Britain.<br />
<br />
   (Passage omitted: brief account of an article in<br />
   the Independent saying that several countries,<br />
   including Russia, have been meeting secretly to<br />
   discuss plans to stop using the dollar in the oil trade)<br />
<br />
   They are planning to introduce the new currency<br />
   in 2018. Yet, in the newspaper's view, it is<br />
   precisely these secret talks that led to the<br />
   price of gold rising. Here, too, the dollar is<br />
   getting weaker as a result of the secret talks.<br />
   (Passage omitted) Before 2018, speculators will<br />
   take advantage of the secret talks 200 more<br />
   times. (Passage omitted: some officials from the<br />
   countries allegedly involved in the talks deny<br />
   knowledge of the talks, say that the newspaper<br />
   article is inaccurate or decline comment)<br />
<br />
   The talks may or may not have taken place, but it<br />
   is certainly inappropriate to babble about it at<br />
   official level, especially as unofficial talk<br />
   about a new world currency replacing the dollar<br />
   is now in fashion. People who several years ago<br />
   were ridiculing suggestions that the dollar and<br />
   the American economy were fundamentally ill are<br />
   now trying to beat each other to bury it. But it<br />
   is not the dollar itself that is the problem, but<br />
   the entire existing financial system.<br />
<br />
   By the way, President Nursultan Nazarbayev of<br />
   Kazakhstan has made a very timely reminder about this.<br />
<br />
   (Narrator, quoting Nazarbayev) It is clear that<br />
   any basket of old defective currencies will be at least equally defective.<br />
<br />
   (Leontyev, continued) The issue is that in a<br />
   fundamentally defective system it is better to<br />
   have a defective dollar because everything else<br />
   would be even worse. As soon as the market<br />
   situation really deteriorates, everyone falls<br />
   back on the dollar because there is nothing else<br />
   in this system really to fall back on. A<br />
   non-defective currency is only possible outside<br />
   this system. But that is not the subject of<br />
   secret talks even with the Chinese and the Saudis.<br />
<br />
   Meanwhile, stories about secret plots and the<br />
   dollar's quick demise are generated by<br />
   speculators, that is the main operators of the<br />
   existing defective system. (Passage omitted)<br />
<br />
   Economics is a science, so a market speculator<br />
   should not be confused with an economist even if he is masquerading as<br />
   such.<br />

   Bi-Annual Draft Begins in the Russian Military<br />
   By Roger McDermott<br />
<br />
   On October 1 the fall military draft began in<br />
   Russia with the defense ministry publicizing its<br />
   a**serious reorganization of the enlistment offices<br />
   system,a** while admitting that recruitment levels<br />
   had been adjusted downwards to 271,000. The scale<br />
   of this change is staggering, which has provoked<br />
   many to question whether the targets for the<br />
   draft will be met. The number of military<br />
   commissariats (enlistment offices) has been<br />
   drastically cut: in the spring of this year there<br />
   were 1,647, now there are only 81.<br />
   Colonel-General Vasily Smirnov the Chief of the<br />
   Main Organization and Mobilization Directorate of<br />
   the General Staff noted that all military posts<br />
   in these offices were abolished on October 1, and<br />
   replaced with civilians. Its aim is to improve<br />
   control over record keeping, streamline the<br />
   administrative structure and ensure its efficient<br />
   use of budget allocations. However, some officers<br />
   have expressed doubts over the restructuring of<br />
   the enlistment offices, ranging from questioning<br />
   their ability to organize training for reservists<br />
   to whether having civilians overseeing the draft<br />
   will result in any improvement (RIA Novosti, October 1).<br />
<br />
   Nevertheless, Smirnov was in no doubt that the<br />
   draft faces serious challenges, which the<br />
   reorganization is partly designed to tackle. For<br />
   instance, he estimated that more 100,000 citizens<br />
   temporarily move their place of residence in<br />
   order to evade the draft. He was unclear about<br />
   how the new system will address such problems,<br />
   but his near farcical threat to hunt down draft<br />
   dodgers hiding with their babushkaa**s in the dacha<br />
   in the countryside was unconvincing; many young<br />
   men will prefer to take their chances with their<br />
   grandmother protecting them from military service (Interfax, September<br />
   30).<br />
<br />
   The defense ministry is convinced that after<br />
   reducing the term of service to twelve months<br />
   that dedovshchina or institutionalized bullying<br />
   within the armed forces is now in decline, and<br />
   offers statistics to support this assertion.<br />
   Smirnov claimed that the recorded instances of<br />
   bullying had declined over the past year by 93<br />
   percent. Nonetheless, the Chief Military<br />
   Prosecutor Sergey Fridinskiy said that more than<br />
   800 servicemen had been convicted of such<br />
   breaches of regulations in 2009. Violent crime is<br />
   gradually declining; which offers little comfort<br />
   to those petrified by the prospect of<br />
   conscription. In the first eight months of 2009<br />
   compared to the same period last year, there were<br />
   13 percent fewer cases related to bullying and an<br />
   11.5 percent drop involving violence. According<br />
   to the chief military prosecutora**s office the<br />
   share of crimes against young conscripts in the<br />
   army a**is not too high,a** accounting for 15 percent<br />
   of all recorded crimes (Interfax, September 30).<br />
<br />
   More than 30 percent of those who presented at<br />
   enlistment offices in the spring 2009 draft were<br />
   deemed unfit for military service, or were<br />
   granted deferments on health grounds. The former<br />
   chief of the defense ministrya**s Main Military<br />
   Medical Directorate Vladimir Shappo said that<br />
   more than 340,000 people were given deferments<br />
   for health reasons in the fall of 2008, and<br />
   334,000 in the fall of 2007. 10,000 recruits were<br />
   told to gain weight, which cost the state 75<br />
   million rubles ($2.5 million). Efforts to address<br />
   these issues include improving the quality of<br />
   medical examinations, with the numbers of<br />
   military doctors more than doubling to around 700<br />
   (compared with this yeara**s spring draft) present<br />
   at draft commissions. Smirnov said that<br />
   conscripts drafted in Chechnya would continue to<br />
   serve only in that republic, despite earlier<br />
   claims by Russian authorities that no conscripts<br />
   served in Chechnya; any future resumption of<br />
   counter-terrorist operations in the region will<br />
   likely involve conscripts. Moreover, he confirmed<br />
   that conscripts will serve in the new bases in<br />
   the breakaway republics of Abkhazia and South<br />
   Ossetia alongside Kontraktniki, or those serving<br />
   on a contract basis (Interfax, September 30).<br />
<br />
   The recruits in this draft cycle will experience<br />
   something previously unknown, since on December 1<br />
   all units in the Russian armed forces will<br />
   transfer to permanent readiness status.<br />
   Maintaining these units at their wartime strength<br />
   will above all allow the military to organize<br />
   proper combat training (ITAR-TASS, September 30).<br />
   Nonetheless, they are unlikely to notice any<br />
   significant improvement in the use of modern<br />
   weaponry. According to Nikolay Tabachkov an<br />
   auditor in the Audit Chamber, the current<br />
   proportion of modern weaponry in the inventory<br />
   does not exceed more than 6 percent (ITAR-TASS, September 23).<br />
<br />
   The new command structure will likely escape<br />
   their attention. On September 7 Nezavisimoye<br />
   Voyennoye Obozreniye accurately predicted that<br />
   strategic-operational commands will be formed on<br />
   the basis of the existing military districts. The<br />
   Moscow-based defense journalist Viktor Litovkin<br />
   later interpreted the confirmation of this latest<br />
   reform as a return to an earlier abortive plan.<br />
   He noted that Army-General Vladimir Boldyrev the<br />
   Commander-in-Chief of the Russian Ground Forces<br />
   had recently said that President Dmitry Medvedev<br />
   will sign a decree in December to make each<br />
   military district simultaneously into a<br />
   strategic-operational command (Nezavisimaya<br />
   Gazeta, September 30). Boldyrev said that groups<br />
   of troops will be subordinate to the strategic<br />
   level commander a**primarily in the operational<br />
   planning, as well as in the general planning of<br />
   the use of the group and its training.a** This<br />
   initiative resembles a failed attempt by the<br />
   former Chief of the General Staff Army-General<br />
   Yury Baluyevskiy, who proposed creating<br />
   strategic-operational commands in theaters of<br />
   operations, though not on the basis of individual<br />
   districts, but by unifying several districts and<br />
   fleets under the new command. However, this never<br />
   received adequate support among the generals or<br />
   district commanders, who apparently feared losing<br />
   power and influence. Crucially, it now appears<br />
   that support for implementing this reform emerged<br />
   from deep within the structures, and consequently<br />
   it gained sufficient backing higher up the chain of command.<br />
<br />
   The precise role of the future reserve remains<br />
   unclear, which will only be clarified once a new<br />
   military doctrine is passed later this year. As<br />
   much as the defense ministry emphasizes the a**new<br />
   looka** armed forces, these conscripts will be<br />
   trained on the basis of combat training manuals,<br />
   which are currently being re-written and will<br />
   take time to introduce; many of these recruits<br />
   will finish their service before the combat<br />
   training system is overhauled. They will be among<br />
   the first conscripts, however, to experience the<br />
   new structures, as well as serving in permanent<br />
   readiness units. The speed of implementing these<br />
   changes is undoubtedly causing significant<br />
   upheaval throughout the structures, which the<br />
   defense ministry hopes will prove to be temporary<br />
   (Vremya Novostei, September 25).<br />

   Nuclear Russia: a**Zeroa** Possibility<br />
   By Simon Saradzhyan in Moscow for ISN Security Watch<br />
   Simon Saradzhyan is a research fellow at Harvard<br />
   Kennedy School's Belfer Center. He is the author<br />
   of several papers on security and terrorism.<br />
<br />
   Nuclear weapons continue to play a vital role in<br />
   Russiaa**s defense, security, foreign and even<br />
   domestic policies, but Moscow should nevertheless<br />
   at least embark on the Global Zero path, Simon<br />
   Saradzhyan comments for ISN Security Watch.<br />
<br />
   Until last year, it would have been difficult to<br />
   imagine that the Russian leadership would embrace<br />
   the vision of a world free of nuclear weapons,<br />
   given the role they play in Russiaa**s policies,<br />
   including that of deterrent and equalizer in the<br />
   overall military balance between Russia and the<br />
   US and its NATO allies, and even between Russia and China.<br />
<br />
   Yet, first, Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, then<br />
   Prime Minister Vladimir Putin and, finally,<br />
   President Dmitry Medvedev publicly praised the idea of 'Global Zero.'<br />
<br />
   April 2009 saw presidents Barack Obama and<br />
   Medvedev sign a declaration committing their<br />
   countries to seeking a world without nuclear<br />
   weapons. Subsequently, Medvedev signed off in May<br />
   on Russiaa**s new Strategy of National Security<br />
   Through the Year 2020, which introduces a commitment to Zero.<br />
<br />
   Most recently, on 24 September, Russia, along<br />
   with other members of the UN Security Council,<br />
   voted to pass Resolution 1887, which aims to<br />
   a**create the conditions for a world without nuclear weapons.a**<br />
<br />
   The Kremlina**s support for nuclear disarmament has<br />
   compelled even such proponents of nuclear<br />
   deterrence as the-then chief of the main<br />
   component of Russiaa**s strategic nuclear triad,<br />
   General Nikolai Solovtsov, to concede that<br />
   nuclear weapons may eventually lose their<br />
   significance and Russia may abandon its nuclear<br />
   status a**as a result of [a*|] a change in the nature of international<br />
   relations.a**<br />
<br />
   These statements and documents prove that Russia<br />
   is ready to take initial steps toward nuclear<br />
   disarmament, including negotiating new nuclear<br />
   arms control treaties with the US. However, any<br />
   further progress on Russiaa**s part toward Zero<br />
   would be possible only if a number of conditions<br />
   are put in place to decrease the value of nuclear<br />
   weapons in Russiaa**s defense and security policies.<br />
<br />
   The Russian leadership has already enumerated a<br />
   number of such consecutive or simultaneous<br />
   external conditions: universal implementation of<br />
   existing nuclear arms control and<br />
   nonproliferation treaties; further and<br />
   irreversible cuts in US-Russian nuclear arsenals;<br />
   constraints on US missile defense and enhancement<br />
   of Russian conventional forces coupled with<br />
   guarantees that no hostile country or alliance<br />
   will have an overwhelming superiority in<br />
   conventional armed forces over Russia and its<br />
   allies; and resolution of major conflicts.<br />
<br />
   Subsequently, there should be a verifiable<br />
   accounting of all nuclear arsenals, their<br />
   reduction and elimination, followed by guarantees<br />
   that no country or sub-state actor would be able<br />
   to develop/acquire such weapons in the future.<br />
   Some of these conditions may prove to be very<br />
   difficult to attain, such as codified guarantees<br />
   that the US and NATO will not have an<br />
   overwhelming superiority in conventional armed<br />
   forces over Russia and its allies.<br />
<br />
   Granted there are these and other major obstacles<br />
   to negotiating Zero, but Russiaa**s current nuclear<br />
   posture also entails major costs and risks,<br />
   including the risk of accidental nuclear war,<br />
   nuclear terrorism and proliferation. Russia and<br />
   other official nuclear powers cannot hope to<br />
   continue holding on to their arsenals in spite of<br />
   their official Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty<br />
   commitments to eliminate them, while also trying<br />
   to convince others to honor their commitments to<br />
   refrain from acquiring nuclear weapons.<br />
<br />
   Russian leaders also know or should know that<br />
   some of the functions assigned to nuclear weapons<br />
   by Russiaa**s strategic documents and strategists<br />
   are doubtful or even unrealistic - such as<br />
   deterring future a**non-military threatsa** as<br />
   proposed by Chief of the General Staff of the<br />
   Russian Armed Forces Nikolai Makarov in February.<br />
   The utility of nuclear weapons as a deterrent<br />
   against the existing threats is also limited.<br />
   Rogue nations know that no nuclear arms are<br />
   likely to be used against them as long as they do<br />
   not launch massive WMD or conventional attacks on<br />
   nuclear powers or their key allies.<br />
<br />
   Likewise, nuclear weapons would not be very<br />
   effective in deterring or ending those types of<br />
   conflict Russia is much more likely to face than<br />
   a hypothetical war with NATO. These include an<br />
   armed conflict with a conventional power,<br />
   intrusion by insurgents or low-intensity conflict<br />
   with such insurgents on Russian territory.<br />
<br />
   Realization of the limitation of the real utility<br />
   of nuclear weapons as well as of the external and<br />
   internal costs and risks associated with<br />
   possessing these weapons should compel Russia to<br />
   start walking along the path to Global Zero together with other nuclear<br />
   powers.<br />
<br />
   A nuclear-free world may prove unattainable in<br />
   the foreseeable future. However, if Russia and<br />
   other nuclear weapons states  take even some of<br />
   the initial steps required to progress towards<br />
   Global Zero, the world will become significantly<br />
   safer, not only for them, but for the entire international community.<br />

   Russia: Thousands of potential conscripts turned down over low weight<br />
   Interfax-AVN<br />
<br />
   Moscow, 5 October: More than 45,000 young men of<br />
   conscription age are annually turned down by<br />
   military conscription commissions because of low<br />
   body weight, the Russian Defence Ministry's<br />
   central military medical commission told<br />
   Interfax's Military Information Agency on Monday (5 October).<br />
<br />
   &quot;It was established during medical examinations<br />
   last year that more than 180,000 conscripts were<br />
   suffering from nutrition problems. To put it<br />
   simply, they have not been eating enough. Out of<br />
   this number, more than 45,000 were not<br />
   conscripted because of their weight being too<br />
   low. About the same number will be allowed to<br />
   defer their military service for the same reason<br />
   this year,&quot; the same source said.<br />
<br />
   The main disorders cited as a reason for army<br />
   service deferrals at present include bone and<br />
   muscular disorders and psychological and mental<br />
   disorders. Some 130,000 people (23 per cent) were<br />
   given deferrals in 2008 because of psychological<br />
   and mental disorders. Another 120,000 people<br />
   (some 22 per cent) had their service deferred<br />
   because of bone and muscular disorders.<br />
<br />
   On the problem of drug abuse, the source said<br />
   that &quot;the number of conscripts suffering from<br />
   drug addiction decreases with each year thanks to<br />
   measures which have been taken&quot;.<br />
<br />
   &quot;A total of 5,700 drug addicts of conscription<br />
   age were registered in 2006. The number shrank to<br />
   3,328 in 2008,&quot; the source said.<br />
<br />
   The majority of military medical commissions<br />
   currently have modern equipment making it<br />
   possible to diagnose the most frequent disorders<br />
   from which conscripts are suffering and to<br />
   arrange treatment for them, the source said.<br />

   Russia-led bloc believes USA aims for geopolitical supremacy - senior MP<br />
   Interfax-AVN<br />
<br />
   Minsk, 6 October: The Collective Security Treaty<br />
   Organization (CSTO) is capable of responding to<br />
   all kinds of challenges to security in the<br />
   Euro-Atlantic space, Chairman of the State Duma<br />
   Security Committee Vladimir Vasilyev has said.<br />
<br />
   &quot;With the adverse effects of the global financial<br />
   crisis, the security situation in the CSTO zone<br />
   is changing dynamically. The CSTO is and will be<br />
   responding to modern challenges and threats in<br />
   the Euro-Atlantic space,&quot; Vasilyev told a meeting<br />
   of the CSTO Parliamentary Assembly's commission<br />
   for defence and security issues.<br />
<br />
   He also pointed out that analysis within the CSTO<br />
   had shown that the trend for US influence was<br />
   continuing, above all &quot;the basing of US Armed<br />
   Forces in the EU, and drawing former USSR countries into NATO's<br />
   sphere of influence&quot;. &quot;The analysis shows that<br />
   the USA is focusing on achieving geopolitical<br />
   superiority and bringing the infrastructure of<br />
   NATO forces closer to Russia's borders,&quot; Vasilyev said.<br />
<br />
   He also stressed that, taking the above situation<br />
   into account, the CSTO was taking appropriate<br />
   measures to neutralize threats. &quot;Part of the<br />
   Zapad-2009 (West 2009) exercise held on<br />
   Belarusian territory made a special contribution,&quot; Vasilyev said.<br />
<br />
   He also said that a set of common information<br />
   countermeasures will be used within the framework<br />
   of the CSTO, as well as a number of agreements on<br />
   favourable terms in the sales of special military<br />
   hardware to member states of the CSTO, and on<br />
   cooperation in the training of military and police personnel.<br />
<br />

   Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan.)<br />

   Part 2, Russian Terrorist Interview in Kabul Prison. Radical Islam Appeal<br />
   Eyed<br />
<br />
   Komsomolskaya Pravda<br />
   July 23, 2009<br />
   Second part of report by Darya Aslamova under the<br />
   rubric &quot;Society&quot;: &quot;Why Did a Russian Fellow From<br />
   Siberia Enlist as a Shahid Suicide Bomber?&quot;<br />
<br />
   In the weekly issue for 16 July of this year<br />
   (2009), our correspondent Darya Aslamova talked<br />
   about how in the Afghan prison of Puli Charkhi<br />
   (as transliterated) not far from Kabul, she met<br />
   with citizen of Russia Andrey Batalov, who is<br />
   serving a five-year sentence for terrorist<br />
   activities. Andrey adopted Islam, went through<br />
   training at a Pakistani madrassa, and illegally<br />
   left for Kabul together with three fighters.<br />
   According to the testimony of the leader of the<br />
   band -- and they were arrested at one of the<br />
   checkpoints -- they wanted to make a living bomb<br />
   out of Andrey. Batalov himself, a perfectly<br />
   normal man, sincerely believed that if he pushed<br />
   a button and at the same time read suras<br />
   (chapters) from the Koran, he would not be hurt<br />
   when the explosion came... &quot;Give me just one<br />
   logical explanation,&quot; I begged Andrey. &quot;A grown<br />
   man of 28 crosses the borders of three countries<br />
   illegally, without a passport, in a woman's<br />
   dress, and in a car filled with explosives. What<br />
   is going on?&quot; &quot;I will not explain anything,&quot;<br />
   Andrey said to me fiercely. &quot;You are like those<br />
   Americans who came to me after I was arrested.<br />
   They kept saying to me that I was spy and a KGB agent...&quot;<br />
<br />
   Why do Europeans andAmericans adopt Islam?<br />
<br />
   It happened a few years ago in Doha, the capital<br />
   of Qatar, at the famous Arab television company<br />
   Al-Jazirah. I was sitting in a cafe with local<br />
   journalists when a very tall, not- young man in<br />
   local clothing whom I unerringly recognized as a<br />
   Jew, and moreover, a Jew of our Russian vintage,<br />
   took a seat at a little table near us. Meeting a<br />
   Jew at Al-Jazirah is like seeing a little pig<br />
   walking without a care along the streets of<br />
   Tehran. The man whom everyone called Abdallakh<br />
   (as transliterated) proved to be the well-known<br />
   American journalist and professor Marc Schleifer,<br />
   an offspring of Odessa emigres, born a Jew, who<br />
   later became a Communist, a follower of Fidel<br />
   Castro and Che Guevara, a Catholic, and finally a<br />
   Shiite Muslim (out of the consideration that<br />
   unlike Sunnis, Shiites are allowed temporary marriages with women).<br />
<br />
   I heard his story in one of Doha's bars. &quot;When I<br />
   came to Morocco as an altogether young man, I had<br />
   managed to become completely disillusioned with<br />
   Judaism, Communism, and Christianity,&quot; Marc<br />
   related. &quot;I am from the generation of 'beatniks,'<br />
   the predecessors of the 'hippies.' Why did I<br />
   choose Morocco? Cheap 'grass' (marijuana) and<br />
   cheap living. Why did I adopt Islam? I was struck<br />
   by altogether simple but surprising things for a<br />
   one-hundred-percent American. My neighbor and<br />
   dealer whom I was buying the 'grass' from would<br />
   always bring bread and food in the evening not<br />
   only for himself, but for me too. It was strange<br />
   to him to eat alone. I was surprised when in any<br />
   place people you do not know offer you food, a<br />
   bed, and a purse simply because you are a guest.<br />
   They do not know your name but they trust you<br />
   completely. I was struck by the respect for<br />
   elders. And when someone is buried in a small<br />
   town, the entire street standst o show respect for the deceased.&quot;<br />
<br />
   &quot;But it is always that way in the East,&quot; I<br />
   commented. &quot;In short, as an unabashed<br />
   individualist, you were missing the communal,<br />
   social relations. But essentially Communism offers the very same thing.&quot;<br />
<br />
   &quot;Communism suggests that you become a cog in an<br />
   enormous machine and ignores your soul. But in<br />
   Islam you remain an individual but at the same<br />
   time are part of a community, and this community<br />
   will never abandon you in your hour of need,&quot; (Schleifer said).<br />
<br />
   I close my eyes and picture it. I am well<br />
   acquainted with everything that Marc Schleifer<br />
   was talking about and I know the unhurried,<br />
   contemplative soul of Islam; I am familiar with<br />
   the appeal and hidden power of poor Muslim<br />
   countries and their ingratiating ability to hold<br />
   on to those who have dallied here and put them in<br />
   a daze with aversion to any action. When<br />
   consciousness has been befuddled to the point<br />
   that life seems to be merely monkeys fighting<br />
   over an empty nutshell. Glimpsed here everywhere<br />
   are poverty, suffering, and diseases of the body,<br />
   but here they are not familiar with either<br />
   nervous disorders or insane haste, just as they<br />
   do not know nagging thoughts of tomorrow. No<br />
   matter how crazy things get, they never get the<br />
   better of the person, and there is something consoling in that thought.<br />
<br />
   And this kingly hospitality and willingness to<br />
   wash the feet of beggars and feed dinner to a<br />
   pauper who begs for shelter in Allah's name.<br />
   Everything that charmed poor Andryusha (nickname<br />
   for Andrey) Batalov so much in fact facilitated<br />
   the final shock to his mental capacities. He<br />
   fervently told me about Muslims' generosity and<br />
   how in prison his Muslim brothers give him money<br />
   and fruit and that Islam essentially frees one of<br />
   material responsibility and, he said, you do not<br />
   have to work -- just sit and pray. At the same<br />
   time, he treated the bag of food I had brought to<br />
   him quite indifferently, merely commenting with<br />
   irritation that now his cellmates would start<br />
   sponging. It turned out that a man living on the<br />
   donations of the local community (everything is<br />
   given -- food, clothing, and even a telephone,<br />
   which he spends hours talking on) can easily take<br />
   things but is not at all willing to share.<br />
<br />
   &quot;Essentially this Andrey perceived Islam as a<br />
   version of a 'free lunch' (khalyava),&quot; my friend<br />
   Katya, who lived in Afghanistan for a few years,<br />
   told me. &quot;But someone made the shirt that he is<br />
   wearing and someone paid for the mutton on his<br />
   plate. He is not taking into consideration that<br />
   every Muslim must give up a certain part of his<br />
   income for charity, and to do that you have to work.&quot;<br />
<br />
   &quot;Why do Russian boys adopt Islam?&quot; Aleksey<br />
   Malashenko, the well-known Russian Islam expert<br />
   says. &quot;In large part it is not even the Russian<br />
   Orthodox religion that they do not like, but the<br />
   customs in Russian Orthodox cathedrals. Say you<br />
   are driving around Russia and are tired and you<br />
   want to stop at a church late at night. Are you<br />
   allowed to sit there a while? No. But in a mosque<br />
   you can drop in at any time and they will never<br />
   chase you out. You can drink, eat, lie down, and<br />
   pray there. The mosque is a kind of interest<br />
   club. People sit on rugs and discuss every kind<br />
   of issue, including political ones. Islam is not<br />
   simply a religion but a way of life.&quot;<br />
<br />
   Why has Islam become a Euro-American fashion? Why<br />
   do people who grew up in an ultra-comfortable<br />
   world where all passions and perversions have<br />
   been legalized suddenly choose such a harsh<br />
   religion? Islam preaches submissiveness, and<br />
   hence, freedom from the tiring burden of<br />
   thinking. Weak people need the steel framework of<br />
   a religion that while constricting their movement<br />
   at the same time supports them. They rush to hide<br />
   --from the storms and the need to choose that<br />
   freedom brings -- in the quiet haven of obedience<br />
   and age-old authorities. In a world where all<br />
   ties have been broken, someone, after all, must<br />
   rap their fingers with a ruler and put them in<br />
   the corner! Must a person truly decide everything<br />
   in the world himself? Really should there in fact<br />
   exist something like a nail in the wall that one<br />
   can grab hold of, or a hand stretched from the<br />
   unknown? The need for this hand is leading the<br />
   white race to an incessant search for God. You will ask, what about<br />
   comfort?<br />
<br />
   Believe me, men are very willing, even glad, to<br />
   free themselves of the bonds of civilization,<br />
   turning toward primitive simplicity and disorder.<br />
   And sex? What of it, in this exhausting climate,<br />
   it is easier for the body to forget what lust actually is.<br />
<br />
   But religion can be either a cup of clean water<br />
   or a nutritious broth for the most sinister<br />
   microbes. With the trusting appetite of a child<br />
   who does not know the difference between cherries<br />
   and poison berries, the newly converted Andryusha<br />
   Batalovs end up in the hands of people who are<br />
   dangerous and cynical and take cunning advantage<br />
   of human foolishness and credulity. &quot;Beware of<br />
   false prophets who come to you in sheep's<br />
   clothing but inwardly they are ravening wolves.<br />
   You will know them by their fruits. Do men gather<br />
   grapes of thorns or figs of thistles?&quot; (Matthew 7:15).<br />
<br />
   Are there Russian citizens in al-Qaida?<br />
<br />
   I first heard of citizens of Russia fighting as<br />
   members of the Islamic international al-Qaida<br />
   from Major General of the Pakistani Army Shaukat<br />
   Sultan (as transliterated) back in 2003. &quot;During<br />
   the operation to purge the fighters in Waziristan<br />
   in March 2003, among the 35 terrorists killed, 22<br />
   proved to foreigners -- Arabs and Chechens,&quot; he<br />
   told me. (In the Islamic world, all inhabitants<br />
   of the Caucasus, including Ingushes and<br />
   Dagestanis, are called Chechens.) &quot;Why didn't you<br />
   turn over the bodies to the Russian Embassy? They<br />
   are our citizens,&quot; (Aslamova said). &quot;Ah-hh,<br />
   actually, there was nothing to turn over. Only<br />
   fragments of bodies were left after the bombing,&quot;<br />
   (Sultan said). &quot;How do you know that they were<br />
   Chechens?&quot; (Aslamova said). &quot;The information from<br />
   our intelligence. Among terrorists there are a<br />
   lot of Uzbeks, Tajiks, and Chechens -- in short,<br />
   Russian-speakers,&quot; (Sultan said).<br />
<br />
   And two months ago, fighters from the Taliban<br />
   movement in Kandahar told me personally, not<br />
   without some pride, that among their mercenaries<br />
   and shahids are not only Chechens, but also<br />
   Russians, namely Russians who come through Moscow<br />
   and Tehran right to Pakistan to camps for<br />
   training suicide bombers, and later they are sent<br />
   to Afghanistan. It is specifically that path that<br />
   the Siberian Andrey Batalov took, according to<br />
   him, altogether by chance. Even if that is in<br />
   fact the case, there must have been someone who<br />
   suggested this chance to him. How were people<br />
   found to convince the Russian fellow from<br />
   Vladikavkaz, Vladimir Vysotskiy, to go study<br />
   first in Syria and then Lebanon, to the city of<br />
   Tripoli? Our Volodya (nickname for Vladimir)<br />
   Vysotskiy has been whiling away the time for more<br />
   than a year now in a prison near Beirut, accused<br />
   of being involved in terrorist activities. In the<br />
   spring of 2007, an antigovernment riot organized<br />
   by the radical grouping Fatah al Islam, which is<br />
   close to al-Qaida, broke out in the Palestinian<br />
   refugee camp Nakhr-al-Barid (as transliterated)<br />
   (Cold Stream) in Tripoli. Bitter fighting went on<br />
   for a couple months, and as a result dozens of<br />
   Lebanese Army soldiers died. In short, they were<br />
   fighting in earnest. Among those who were trying<br />
   to escape the encirclement with weapons in their<br />
   hands was Russian citizen Vysotskiy (his<br />
   Caucasian accomplice, also a citizen of Russia,<br />
   by the way, managed to slip away). Vysotskiy<br />
   suffered a contusion and ended up inprison. His<br />
   trial is supposed to take place in the next few<br />
   months. His explanations were simple and<br />
   touching. Our boy wanted to enroll in Tripoli<br />
   University (has anyone in Russia heard of such a<br />
   thing?). But when he and his comrades came to the<br />
   university from Syria (?!), there were no longer<br />
   any places and his visa had expired. Volodya<br />
   drifted around Tripoli for a few days until he<br />
   met some Palestinians from the refugee camp. They<br />
   suggested that he live with them for a while for<br />
   free and without any problems with the visa,<br />
   since the local police do not stick their noses<br />
   in the camp. And when the trouble came (in the<br />
   sense of the attack on the camp), Vysotskiy was<br />
   distinctly told: &quot;Brother, you lived and ate with<br />
   us, now you fight for us too.&quot;<br />
<br />
   To the terrorists all these Andryusha Batalovs<br />
   and Volodya Vysotskiys, passionate Russian boys<br />
   seeking God or adventures, are merely the nails<br />
   that need nothing but blows from a hamme rto<br />
   enter the board, and religion acts as the hammer.<br />
   &quot;Our fellows are moved by both a sense of protest<br />
   and a yearning for self-expression,&quot; Islam expert<br />
   Aleksey Malashenko says. &quot;Islam is now beating<br />
   Christianity as the youngest and most impassioned<br />
   religion. It is active and it is aggressive -- I<br />
   do not mean brutal, but specifically the desire<br />
   to realize itself. That is attractive to young<br />
   people. There is action in Islam. If it is Bin<br />
   Ladin, then it is the super terrific Bin Ladin!<br />
   If small Chechnya is fighting enormous Russia,<br />
   then look how it fights! And Iran is not afraid<br />
   to give mighty America the 'finger' (fig). The<br />
   selfless fanaticism also attracts Europeans to<br />
   Islam. Just take Bin Ladin himself. The dude has<br />
   at least $30 million, and according to some<br />
   estimates, he is a billionaire. Why the devil did<br />
   he get into this cause? What does he get out of<br />
   it? Wealth? No, he spends it. Either he is<br />
   wandering around the caves of Tora-Bora, or he<br />
   lives in Sudan in an abandoned barrack for a<br />
   year. Why in blazes does he need all that? He is fighting for an idea.<br />
<br />
   &quot;You must agree that it makes an impression. His<br />
   ideology is a terrible and merciless thing<br />
   because he is accountable only to Allah. If you<br />
   believe only in that accountability, you give<br />
   yourself the right to do anything that you want,<br />
   even bomb and destroy. The press often deceives<br />
   us, saying that the shahids are paid money for<br />
   the bombings. That is all nonsense. The most<br />
   frightening thing is that they are all honest<br />
   fellows. When I am told that only bandits are<br />
   fighting in the North Caucasus, I do not believe<br />
   it. They are normal fanatics ready to risk death<br />
   for their faith. If you have a talk with such a<br />
   type, he proves to be the nicest person. He will<br />
   drag you out of the fire and save and feed you,<br />
   but later he will slit your throat not because he<br />
   is bad, but because according to his faith, he<br />
   must. We let the moment slip by when a lot of<br />
   staunch believers who were disillusioned with the<br />
   earlier values appeared in Russia. We were not<br />
   able to offer them anything in the sense of ideology.&quot;<br />
<br />
   &quot;But just why doesn't the liberalism of<br />
   Christianity make an impression on the secular,<br />
   unenthusiastic Muslims living in Russia and<br />
   Europe, those who drink vodka, chase after women,<br />
   and do not know what the 'namaz' (ritual prayer)<br />
   is? Why don't THEY have the temptation to change religions?&quot; (Aslamova<br />
   said).<br />
<br />
   &quot;Actually because a Muslim CANNOT convert to<br />
   Christianity. If he did that, under Islam he is a<br />
   renegade and must be killed. This fear is<br />
   instilled in him on the subconscious level,<br />
   genetically. He knows that yes, he is a bad,<br />
   drinking Muslim, but even so he remains a Muslim<br />
   till his last hour,&quot; (Malashenko said).<br />
<br />
   Back in 2001 at a Holy Friday demonstration in<br />
   the city of Peshawar in Pakistan, I suddenly<br />
   caught sight of a bright-eyed European man of<br />
   about 40 with typically Russian facial features<br />
   in a crowd of believers leaving a mosque. He was<br />
   dressed like a Pakistani, and for a few seconds<br />
   we stared at each other. &quot;Where are you from?&quot; he<br />
   suddenly shouted to me in Russian over people's<br />
   heads. &quot;From Russia,&quot; I said, stunned. &quot;I was<br />
   once a Russian too,&quot; the strange man started<br />
   laughing, and before the crowd took him away, he<br />
   managed to shout, &quot;Say hello to Mother Russia!&quot;<br />

   Only one U.S. cargo flown to Afghanistan via Russia<br />
   October 7, 2009<br />
<br />
   MOSCOW (Reuters) - The United States has so far<br />
   sent only one shipment of supplies through<br />
   Russian airspace to its troops in Afghanistan<br />
   since Moscow and Washington agreed a transit deal<br />
   in July, the Kremlin said Wednesday.<br />
<br />
   The White House had said the deal on transit of<br />
   troops, supplies and weapons, which was struck<br />
   when President Barack Obama visited Russia, would<br />
   allow up to 4,500 flights a year and save up to<br />
   $133 million a year in transit costs.<br />
<br />
   &quot;Once in early August, such a cargo was<br />
   delivered,&quot; said Kremlin spokeswoman Natalya<br />
   Timakova, without elaborating on why the American<br />
   side had made so few requests for flights.<br />
<br />
   The deal, the first achievement toward<br />
   &quot;resetting&quot; thorny relations between Moscow and<br />
   Washington, was advertised during Obama's visit<br />
   as an alternative to more dangerous routes, such as via Pakistan.<br />
<br />
   &quot;There are no problems on our side,&quot; said<br />
   Timakova. &quot;We are open for cooperation.&quot;<br />
<br />
   Analysts have warned that airlifting major<br />
   supplies through the vast territories of Russia<br />
   and the central Asian ex-Soviet states could be<br />
   excessively expensive. Negotiating a land transit<br />
   deal could be a realistic alternative, they say.<br />
<br />
   President Dmitry Medvedev has said Russia fully<br />
   backs U.S.-led efforts to crush Taliban<br />
   guerrillas in Afghanistan, although it would not<br />
   send its own soldiers to fight in the country<br />
   where Moscow lost a 10-year war in the 1980s.<br />
<br />
   Russia views instability in Afghanistan as a<br />
   major security threat to itself and its southern,<br />
   predominantly Muslim neighbors as well as a source of growing drug<br />
   traffic.<br />

   Russia: US fight against Afghan drugs insufficient<br />
   By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV (AP)<br />
   October 7, 2009<br />
<br />
   MOSCOW a** Russia's counter-narcotics chief on<br />
   Wednesday criticized U.S. and NATO anti-drug<br />
   efforts in Afghanistan as inadequate and called<br />
   for joint action against the Afghan heroin<br />
   flooding into the former Soviet Union.<br />
<br />
   Russian-U.S. counter-drug efforts are considered<br />
   a key area of cooperation as both countries try<br />
   to improve relations following years of tensions.<br />
   Afghanistan's role as the world's biggest<br />
   producer of opium was the subject of a recent<br />
   meeting in Washington between Viktor Ivanov, head<br />
   of Russia's drug control agency, and U.S. drug czar Gil Kerlikowske.<br />
<br />
   Ivanov told The Associated Press Wednesday that<br />
   during that meeting he urged the U.S. to spray<br />
   herbicide from the air to eradicate Afghanistan's<br />
   fields of opium poppies. &quot;I hope that our<br />
   open-minded dialogue will encourage the U.S. to<br />
   take more adequate measures,&quot; Ivanov said.<br />
<br />
   President Barack Obama's administration has<br />
   abandoned the Bush-era policy of large-scale<br />
   eradication of drugs in Afghanistan, saying the<br />
   only thing the tactic would achieve would be to<br />
   boost support for the Taliban. The U.S. instead<br />
   has focused on targeting drug labs and encouraging alternative crops.<br />
<br />
   Ivanov, a former KGB officer who served in<br />
   Afghanistan during the Soviet war there in the<br />
   1980s, told the AP that growing wheat and other<br />
   legal crops isn't practical in the midst of the escalating conflict.<br />
<br />
   &quot;As long as the situation remains tense and the<br />
   confrontation continues, no one will engage in<br />
   agriculture,&quot; he said. &quot;They won't be able to<br />
   cultivate grain even if they want to.&quot;<br />
<br />
   Kerlikowske and State Department officials agreed<br />
   to continue discussions of the proposal, Ivanov said.<br />
<br />
   A recent U.N. report found that the amount of<br />
   land planted with opium poppies in Afghanistan<br />
   dropped 36 percent between 2007 and 2008. But the<br />
   same report said the amount of opium produced<br />
   fell by only 10 percent, due to improved growing techniques.<br />
<br />
   Ivanov insisted that the aerial spraying of<br />
   herbicides is the only efficient way to stem the<br />
   drug trade, and pointed out that the U.S. has<br />
   used the tactic against the illicit coca crop a**<br />
   the source of cocaine a** in Colombia.<br />
<br />
   He argued that efforts to eradicate poppy fields<br />
   on the ground in Afghanistan have brought few<br />
   results. He also said that the Western decision<br />
   to entrust the task of fighting drugs to the<br />
   Afghan government was a mistake because local<br />
   authorities lack the clout to accomplish the goal.<br />
<br />
   Afghanistan provides more than 90 percent of the<br />
   heroin consumed around the world, and the bulk of<br />
   it flows through ex-Soviet Central Asia and Russia.<br />
<br />
   While Moscow is leery of the presence of U.S. and<br />
   NATO troops in Afghanistan, Russia is counting on<br />
   those troops to stem the flow of Muslim militants<br />
   and Afghan heroin into the former Soviet Union.<br />
<br />
   Earlier this year, the Kremlin allowed the<br />
   shipment of supplies for U.S. forces in<br />
   Afghanistan across the Russian territory a** a<br />
   route that could become an increasingly important<br />
   alternative to Pakistan, where supply convoys are sometimes attacked.<br />
<br />
   Ivanov said that Russia has an estimated 2<br />
   million to 2.5 million addicts, and 90 percent of<br />
   them use drugs from Afghanistan.<br />
<br />
   He said that the U.S. may not feel the problem is<br />
   urgent because Afghan drugs don't make it to the<br />
   United States. The U.S. Drug Enforcement<br />
   Administration says most heroin consumed in the<br />
   U.S. comes from Mexico and South America.<br />
<br />
   Despite U.S.-Russian differences on how to solve<br />
   the Afghan drug problem, Ivanov vowed to expand<br />
   joint anti-narcotics efforts with Washington. &quot;We<br />
   are interested in cooperation,&quot; he said.<br />

   Patriarch Kirill, Pope Benedict not to meet yet - Russian Church<br />
<br />
   MOSCOW, October 6 (RIA Novosti) - The head of the<br />
   Russian Orthodox Church's external church<br />
   relations department has denied reports that a<br />
   Vatican meeting of the Russian Church leader and the pope is being<br />
   prepared.<br />
<br />
   &quot;There is no preparation for the patriarch's trip<br />
   to the Vatican or his meeting with the pope in<br />
   any specific place at any specific time now,&quot;<br />
   Archbishop Hilarion of Volokolamsk told an<br />
   audience of young people in a Moscow museum.<br />
<br />
   &quot;The goal is not in holding a meeting but for us<br />
   to drastically improve our relations and overcome<br />
   the existing problems,&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
   However, Hilarion said Patriarch Kirill of Moscow<br />
   and All Russia and Pope Benedict XVI could<br />
   theoretically meet &quot;on neutral territory,&quot; but<br />
   added that this was not being discussed yet.<br />
<br />
   As a result of the Great Schism, Christianity<br />
   split in 1054 AD into the Eastern branch (the<br />
   Orthodox Church) and the Western branch (the<br />
   Roman Catholic Church). They have a number of<br />
   theological and political differences.<br />
<br />
   Russian President Dmitry Medvedev said in July<br />
   that Moscow planned to improve ties with the<br />
   Vatican, which have been strained in recent years<br />
   over claims the Roman Catholic Church was trying<br />
   to convert believers and spread its influence in<br />
   former Soviet states following the collapse of the U.S.S.R.<br />
<br />
   The late Patriarch Alexy II refused to meet with<br />
   then Pope John Paul II, and said outstanding<br />
   disputes needed to be resolved before any meeting<br />
   could go ahead with the current Catholic Church leader, Benedict XVI.<br />
<br />
   When Alexy II died in December at the age of 79,<br />
   the enthronement of Russia's new church leader<br />
   Patriarch Kirill, who was seen as a liberal in<br />
   the largely traditionalist church, was welcomed by the Vatican.<br />
<br />
   As head of the Russian Orthodox Church's external<br />
   relations for more than a decade, Kirill had led<br />
   dialogue with the Vatican and other churches.<br />

   Russian suspension hits Australia's kangaroo meat industry hard<br />
   Scott Bevan, Moscow<br />
<br />
   Australia's kangaroo meat industry is being<br />
   devastated by a continuing import ban imposed by Russia.<br />
<br />
   The Russians were taking up to sixty percent of<br />
   available supplies, but officials are refusing to<br />
   lift the current suspension until Australia can<br />
   prove that the meat is safe and free from contaminants.<br />
<br />
   The ban has been in force since August, after the<br />
   Russian government agency, Rosselkhoznadzor,<br />
   first voiced its concerns about possible contamination.<br />
<br />
   Now the struggling Australian industry is<br />
   appealing for assistance from the federal government.<br />
<br />
   Alexei Alexsenko from Rosselkhoznadzor says he's<br />
   sorry the kangaroo industry's experiencing hard<br />
   times, but it must demonstrate that<br />
   its product satisfies Russian hygiene regulations.<br />
<br />
   &quot;If the meat is safe, Russians would buy it in<br />
   great numbers,&quot; said Mr Alexsenko.<br />
<br />
   The ABC understands the ban will be discussed at<br />
   a meeting of Australian and Russian government<br />
   representatives in Moscow next week.<br />

   Russian pundit discusses EU integration, missile defense, nuclear Iran<br />
<br />
   Komsomolskaya Pravda<br />
   September 30, 2009<br />
   Interview, under the rubric &quot;Politics&quot;, with<br />
   Mikhail Delyagin, director of the Institute of<br />
   Problems of Globalization, conducted by Yelena<br />
   Chinkova: &quot;Mikhail Delyagin: 'Poland is a kind of European Palestine'&quot;)<br />
<br />
   The hopes of Eastern Europe for integration into<br />
   the European Union overall have not been realized.<br />
<br />
   The results of the 20-year process of integration<br />
   of the Eastern European countries into the<br />
   European Union are extremely contradictory. The<br />
   world economic crisis only aggravated the<br />
   existing problems, and earning bonuses on<br />
   traditional anti-Russian rhetoric is no longer so<br />
   simple. Obama's rejection of plans to deploy a<br />
   missile defence system in the Czech Republic and<br />
   Poland were the last straw. Mikhail Delyagin, the<br />
   director of the Institute of Problems of<br />
   Globalization, answered Komsomolskaya Pravda's questions.<br />
<br />
   (Chinkova) Is the 20-year process of integration<br />
   of Eastern Europe into the European Union<br />
   successful? Or does no one really need it and all<br />
   the prospects are in fact illusory?<br />
<br />
   (Delyagin) The standard of living has risen, but<br />
   overall the hopes have not been realized. Poland<br />
   is more stable than anyone, but it is still<br />
   Eastern Europe, all the way down to the<br />
   comparatively poor roads. Unemployment even<br />
   officially was around 20 per cent and declined to<br />
   9 per cent because people left to make money. Now<br />
   the people are returning, but what next? And in Latvia it is simply a<br />
   disaster.<br />
<br />
   (Chinkova) They are economizing on pensions and closing schools...<br />
<br />
   (Delyagin) They are economizing even on state<br />
   security. And the Estonian police, so they say in<br />
   Estonia, are taking bribes for the first time in history.<br />
<br />
   (Chinkova) Might not the appearance of a Russian<br />
   mayor in Riga be a sign of a return to a less<br />
   militant course in relation to Russia?<br />
<br />
   (Delyagin) That is a response to the crisis:<br />
   fresh ideas are needed, and if they do not<br />
   appear, at least there is a broader circle of<br />
   people allowed to make decisions and so agree<br />
   with them. Whoever is permitted to participate in<br />
   politics rarely breaks glass (riots). The Polish<br />
   authorities found a brilliant way out - to<br />
   capitalize on the disagreements between, notably,<br />
   the United States and &quot;old Europe&quot;. Poland is a<br />
   kind of &quot;European Palestine&quot;: Arafat's heirs know<br />
   that peace would deprive them of their influence<br />
   and money. Attacks on Russia give significance to<br />
   the Polish leaders. They influence the fate of<br />
   Nord Stream and set the tone in rewriting<br />
   history, but that is not because life is so good.<br />
<br />
   The Poles whom I know speak of Krynica, Poland's<br />
   most fashionable and beautiful resort, with a<br />
   sigh. The service there is such that in a cafe<br />
   you have to go up to the waiter or they won't<br />
   notice you. In the centre of the city are<br />
   beautiful abandoned homes and iron roofs with<br />
   rust spots, and the secondary roads are often<br />
   just wrecks. There is no heating, although the<br />
   nights are cold - even in a provincial Chinese<br />
   dormitory, I was given an electric blanket in such a situation.<br />
<br />
   That does not mean that the Poles are bad - it<br />
   means that things are bad for them. Their<br />
   resentment towards us is largely caused by the<br />
   fact that we do not explain the justification for<br />
   our position. Even the situation with Katyn is<br />
   not straightforward - serious voices are heard<br />
   saying that under Gorbachev certain documents in<br />
   favour of a &quot;world community&quot; were simply forged.<br />
   On the other hand, we keep our mouths shut about<br />
   the captive Red Army men who were starved to<br />
   death. The acting Polish ambassador commented to<br />
   me, &quot;in all honesty&quot;, that they were not killed -<br />
   supposedly they died on their own from hunger and<br />
   illness. Such a free democratic choice. And there<br />
   were many times more of them than were killed at<br />
   Katyn. And if we were really the ones who did<br />
   Katyn, let's apologize to each other. But they do not want to.<br />
<br />
   When we read authoritative opinions that Russians<br />
   are vile creatures and when the word &quot;fascism&quot; is<br />
   becoming the most common descriptive word applied<br />
   to the word &quot;Russian&quot;... When there is no Great<br />
   Patriotic War (World War II) in textbooks in<br />
   Ukraine, but there is the foreign war of the<br />
   Germans and the Russians that brought trouble to<br />
   the Ukrainian people... When every Podrabinek<br />
   writes that the ones who defended our Homeland<br />
   were prison guards, dregs, and at best slaves,<br />
   while the real heroes were the followers of<br />
   Bandera, &quot;basmaches&quot; (Central Asian<br />
   counterrevolutionaries), and traitors, and we are<br />
   silent - we our destroying ourselves. Lack of<br />
   opposition merely encourages violence. Either try<br />
   to prove that you are right and or you will<br />
   always and in every way be guilty slaves.<br />
<br />
   (Chinkova) Moscow responded sluggishly to the<br />
   resolution of the Polish Sejm on the &quot;invasion&quot;<br />
   of Western Ukraine and Belarus by Soviet troops.<br />
   Even the word &quot;genocide&quot; flashed by and the State<br />
   Duma committee merely sent an angry message.<br />
<br />
   (Delyagin) We must respond at least<br />
   symmetrically. After all, equating Stalin with<br />
   Hitler is an outrage against our people. If only<br />
   because unlike Fascism, Stalinism, which I hate,<br />
   did not carry out genocide on a nationality basis<br />
   or wars of conquest (the war with Finland for the<br />
   sake of moving the borders away from Leningrad<br />
   right before the great war is a controversial<br />
   issue). We were not fighting Poland either: at<br />
   the moment troops went into Western Ukraine and<br />
   Belarus, it no longer existed as a state. The<br />
   government and generals who had just refused<br />
   Soviet support against Hitler fled, abandoning<br />
   their people and army. If they had fought, Stalin<br />
   would not have brought in troops.<br />
<br />
   (Chinkova) Is the Eastern Partnership programme,<br />
   which has caused quite a stir, &quot;viable&quot;? Is it<br />
   Europe's dressing room or the latest ring around<br />
   Russia? Will the Europeans continue to fatten up<br />
   our neighbours in the crisis or close up shop?<br />
<br />
   (Delyagin) They will fatten them up, but<br />
   obviously not enough. Lithuania asked the<br />
   European Commission for 3.5m euros for its<br />
   unemployed people, but the developed countries of<br />
   Europe themselves do not have enough - that is<br />
   where Merkel's perfectly rational strategy of<br />
   &quot;everyone for himself&quot; comes from. The meaning of<br />
   the Eastern Partnership is simple: we give you<br />
   our standards and take your resources. The<br />
   transition to European standards undermines the<br />
   possibility of integration with Russia and makes<br />
   it easier for them to be assimilated by &quot;old Europe's&quot; businesses.<br />
<br />
   The Eastern Partnership creates the illusion<br />
   among its participants that they can join the<br />
   European Union, but alas, that is impossible:<br />
   Europe is played out and the European Partnership<br />
   is merely preparation for &quot;topping up&quot; the<br />
   European Union through the exploitation of these<br />
   territories. But that is not an accusation: if<br />
   our government lackeys cannot build human<br />
   relations even with Belarus, what is there to<br />
   accuse the Europeans of? We ourselves are letting everything slip away.<br />
<br />
   (Chinkova) Will Belarus continue to sit on the<br />
   fence or are we losing it for good?<br />
<br />
   (Delyagin) Belarus does not want to lose our side<br />
   of the fence: its economy is largely a transit<br />
   one. We help them, but if somebody helped us like<br />
   that, that money would not even get into the<br />
   country. They are effective, but their margin of<br />
   safety is running out. Lukashenka's policies are<br />
   effective too: he has overcome the blockade by<br />
   the West, which will now help Belarus retreat<br />
   from Russia. We will be &quot;milked&quot;, but there is a<br />
   chance for accelerated integration. There is just<br />
   one obstacle to it: as the Belarusians say, if<br />
   you do not take care of your own people, why on<br />
   earth would you take care of ours? How can you<br />
   help us when you do not help yourself?<br />
<br />
   (Chinkova) Has Minsk's recognition of Abkhazia<br />
   and South Ossetia been shelved for good?<br />
<br />
   (Delyagin) That is a card that Lukashenka will<br />
   play both with us and with the European Union.<br />
   The European Union today seems more rational and<br />
   affluent - so it is hardly likely to recognize<br />
   them, and they will live as Northern Cyprus does.<br />
<br />
   (Chinkova) Dmitriy Medvedev did not rule out<br />
   setting up relations with Georgia, but with new<br />
   leadership. Will Saakashvili serve out his term?<br />
<br />
   (Delyagin) Saakashvili is as much a gift to<br />
   Russia as oil is. That same Burjanadze, who is<br />
   offended by our government lackeys, would be no<br />
   less anti-Russian, but intelligent. I think that<br />
   Saakashvili will leave on schedule or even later:<br />
   the opposition is giving the impression of being<br />
   more lovers of talking than of acting. Reasonable<br />
   oppositionists must be selected and helped, but<br />
   the most important thing is to set up relations<br />
   with people who are formally Saakashvili's<br />
   associates: the replacement will be one of them.<br />
   And these people need to be turned towards<br />
   Russia, so that in Georgia they stop believing<br />
   that their troubles are because Russia,<br />
   supposedly, has been fighting them for 17 years.<br />
<br />
   (Chinkova) Haven't the Abkhazians already rushed<br />
   even to start their own church, despite Moscow's objections?<br />
<br />
   (Delyagin) The church today is an element of the<br />
   state system. The Ukrainians up and started their<br />
   own church, and how are the Abkhazians any worse?<br />
<br />
   (Chinkova) So will the Poles and the Baltic<br />
   people now decide against integration with Russia?<br />
<br />
   (Delyagin) Right. In Eastern Europe hatred of<br />
   Russia has been a criterion for democracy for 20<br />
   years now; that cannot be gotten rid of quickly<br />
   and the West's political influence determines<br />
   everything there. And besides, why should they<br />
   stop saying that Russia is bad. After all, Russia<br />
   leaves insults unpunished. Our response is the<br />
   long ago idiotic action near the Estonian embassy and several Poles beaten<br />
   up.<br />
<br />
   We were indignant over the moving of the Bronze<br />
   Soldier and the Estonian police killed a man -<br />
   did we impose sanctions against Estonia? Other<br />
   than a solemn call by Prime Minister S. Ivanov<br />
   not to buy Estonian sour cream? If we really<br />
   dislike fascism - where are the sanctions against<br />
   the state policy of its revival? We must<br />
   officially apologize for not finding the<br />
   criminals who beat up several Poles a few years<br />
   ago, because we are guilty of that, and we must<br />
   apply measures of economic pressure on Poland -<br />
   if there are no others - for the anti-Russian<br />
   policy that it is guilty of. Why are there Polish<br />
   apples in Moscow when our own are rotting? Where<br />
   is the reimbursement for the damages for the<br />
   unidentified buffalo meat disguised as Polish<br />
   meat? For us to be respected, we must respect<br />
   ourselves. If I am going to be mad at the whole<br />
   world and feel sorry for myself, although my life<br />
   will be full, it will be short - they will trample me into the dirt.<br />
<br />
   (Chinkova) But what should the Poles offended by<br />
   America do? Immediately after the rejection of<br />
   the missile defence system, Sikorski, the head of<br />
   the Polish MID (Ministry of Foreign Affairs),<br />
   declared that Warsaw's main ally is the European<br />
   Union. Is our optimism regarding the curtailing<br />
   of the missile defence system justified? The<br />
   Pentagon says that American missile defence may appear in the Caucasus.<br />
<br />
   (Delyagin) It is a good thing that the slap in<br />
   the face from Obama reminded the Poles of<br />
   Europe... But European missile defence had no<br />
   military significance: it attracted the Poles and<br />
   Czechs and distracted our government lackeys<br />
   towards a &quot;worthless object.&quot; They failed to<br />
   notice the creation of missile defence against us<br />
   - in Alaska - and against China - in California,<br />
   the creation of sea-based missile defence, and<br />
   the end of the experiment with air-based missile<br />
   defence. As for missile defence in Georgia - to<br />
   the United States this is a method for<br />
   entrenching itself there rather than protecting itself from Iran.<br />
<br />
   (Chinkova) Iran is building a second uranium<br />
   enrichment centre and testing missiles. Won't<br />
   that push the Americans to take tough actions?<br />
<br />
   (Delyagin) Iran's authorities are also obsessed<br />
   with the idea of modernization and want to make<br />
   their country influential. In one combine there,<br />
   they are already making more ethylene than is<br />
   produced in all of Russia. Ahmadinezhad grew up<br />
   in the trenches and knows that if a war begins,<br />
   he will not be appearing in the UN General<br />
   Assembly but in a bunker, and not for long, since<br />
   he will simply be killed. So his job is not to<br />
   fight but to secure atomic energy for Iran in<br />
   order to refine and export the oil and gas rather<br />
   than &quot;burn up money&quot;, as Medvedev said. He has<br />
   roughly the same attitude towards the United<br />
   States and Israel as the Poles do towards Russia.<br />
   And in denying the Holocaust, he delivered just<br />
   as sacred an affront to the Israelis as<br />
   Podrabinek did to the Russians, and their feelings are understandable.<br />
<br />
   Some Israeli leaders are trying to resolve<br />
   domestic problems with a strike outside the<br />
   country. The Americans understand that any strike<br />
   against Iran would blow up the Near and Middle<br />
   East. Israel's strike would be delivered across<br />
   the US &quot;zone of responsibility&quot;, which would turn<br />
   it into a co-participant. And after all, the idea<br />
   of receiving not polonium poured from a teapot<br />
   but kilograms of radioactive dust in the centre<br />
   of New York appeals to no one. If the &quot;ruthless&quot;<br />
   Bush was afraid, even more so does Obama not want<br />
   war. Probably the Americans will drag their feet,<br />
   saying we are with Israel with all our hearts,<br />
   blow these scum away in the john, but first let<br />
   us impose UN sanctions. And we agreed, because we<br />
   yield to Obama in everything without receiving anything in exchange.<br />
<br />
   (Chinkova) And what about the gesture involving<br />
   curtailing missile defence in Europe?<br />
<br />
   (Delyagin) If the owner of a flower shop gave you<br />
   a bouquet of flowers that it was time to discard,<br />
   that would not be love. It is recycling useless<br />
   goods. Our response is appropriate - the<br />
   abandonment of the deployment of non-existent Iskanders.<br />
<br />
   (Chinkova) And how should the president of Russia<br />
   behave after the Iranian escapades? Washington is<br />
   now expecting a tougher line from Moscow.<br />
<br />
   (Delyagin) He gave his word - so he must keep it.<br />
   But he did not agree to just any sanctions. He<br />
   must support those that do not risk war. And he<br />
   must talk with the Chinese so that they veto<br />
   anything that stirs in the United Nations: they<br />
   are the ones that Iran supplies oil to, not us.<br />
<br />
   (Chinkova) Russia itself now also needs to<br />
   protect its interests in the Kurils. The Japanese<br />
   premier assured his people that already during<br />
   this generation, they will resolve the territorial question with us...<br />
<br />
   (Delyagin) That means that we as the generation<br />
   of builders of Communism under Khrushchev will<br />
   live forever. If he believes that he will resolve<br />
   this problem, let him share the secret of eternal<br />
   life - we will pay with anything except our land.<br />
<br />
   (Chinkova) Some time back Brzezinski expounded<br />
   that the West needs Russia without Ukraine. That<br />
   assignment is being fulfilled. Should we expect<br />
   changes from the new government?<br />
<br />
   (Delyagin) The tragedy of Ukraine is that there<br />
   is no pro-Ukrainian politician. The scale of<br />
   falsification is insane. Yatsenyuk missed his<br />
   chance, people are tired of Yushchenko.<br />
   Yanukovych is still beating Tymoshenko, but<br />
   surprises must be expected from her. Our<br />
   bureaucracy appears to be betting on Tymoshenko -<br />
   perhaps because she is controlled by the United<br />
   States. Here you do not have Yushchenko's wife: a<br />
   man can divorce a wife, but no one has yet<br />
   managed to &quot;divorce&quot; a criminal case.<br />
<br />
   (Chinkova) Can we hope that in the New Year,<br />
   Russia's relations with the European Union will<br />
   not once again start to split along the seams<br />
   because of a gas war? Tymoshenko guarantees that<br />
   this time she will not welcome the holiday on her way to Moscow.<br />
<br />
   (Delyagin) That will not affect the relations<br />
   with France and Germany - the heart of the<br />
   European Union. And let the lunatics and mad dogs<br />
   bark. We can make friends with them and talk, but<br />
   kowtowing to them means getting stung all over.<br />
   We must prove with actions that the falsification<br />
   of history is punishable. And let Tymoshenko<br />
   herself behave so that after welcoming the New<br />
   Year, she does not have to go to Russia five<br />
   minutes later. That is her problem, not ours.<br />

   Iran sanctions may test reset of U.S.-Russian relations - U.S.researcher<br />
<br />
         WASHINGTON.  Oct  7 (Interfax) - The Iran nuclear problem remains a<br />
   key factor  in  resetting  U.S.-Russian  relations,  said  Angela Stent,<br />
   professor  of  government and foreign service and director of the Center<br />
   for Eurasian, Russian and East European Studies in the Georgetown School<br />
   of Foreign Service.<br />
         If  a  number  of  European  countries  and  the U.S. support a new<br />
   resolution  imposing  stricter  sanctions  on Iran and Russia refuses to<br />
   support  it,  this  would affect the resetting process, Stent said in an<br />
   interview with Interfax.<br />
         Washington expects practical results from the negotiations on a new<br />
   treaty to  replace the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START), although<br />
   it would not be easy to reach an agreement, Stent said. Despite the fact<br />
   that the  negotiating  teams  are working very quickly, it would be very<br />
   difficult  to  make  an agreement before December 2009, when START is to<br />
   expire, she said.<br />
         The  U.S.  and Russia still have a lot of differences regarding the<br />
   calculation  of the weapons possessed by both sides, but the negotiating<br />
   teams are  made  up  of people who have known each other from the Soviet<br />
   times, Stent  said.  Despite  many  technical problems, the parties will<br />
   eventually reach an agreement, Stent said.<br />
         Asked  whether  she believes the new U.S. Administration's position<br />
   on Georgia's and Ukraine's possible accession to NATO has changed, Stent<br />
   suggested  that  the Obama Administration cannot say that NATO would not<br />
   enlarge through the incorporation of former Soviet republics.<br />
         Stent said she would be surprised if some progress in this issue is<br />
   made under  the  Obama  Administration  and suggested that Ukraine's and<br />
   Georgia's accession to NATO would be suspended for some time.<br />
         There is not a single chance to narrow disagreements between Russia<br />
   and the  U.S.  on  Georgia  at  the  present  time, as Russia recognizes<br />
   Abkhazia  and South Ossetia as independent states, while the U.S. firmly<br />
   supports  Georgia's territorial integrity, Stent said. The only possible<br />
   decision now is to wait, she said.<br />
         Russia  and  the  U.S. may work together on a lot of other problems<br />
   and pigeonhole  the  Georgia  problem  for  some  time, Stent said. Such<br />
   problems,  like  for  instance,  the  problem  of  a divided Cyprus, are<br />
   usually longstanding, Stent said.<br />
         What  counts  most  is  that  there  should be no violence in these<br />
   regions,  Stent  said.  She  warned  that, if an armed conflict develops<br />
   between Russia and Georgia, this would significantly complicate Russian-<br />
   U.S. relations.<br />

   Russia Responds on the Iran Issue<br />
<br />
   AFTER A WEEK OF SILENCE following the Oct. 1<br />
   talks with Iran in Geneva, Russian officials<br />
   issued a series of statements Tuesday. First,<br />
   Deputy Foreign Minister Aleksey Borodavkin told<br />
   Itar-Tass directly that Russia intends to<br />
   continue its military-technical cooperation with<br />
   Iran, though within the strict framework of<br />
   international laws on such matters. Borodavkina**s<br />
   statement comes in response to U.S. and Israeli<br />
   demands for Russia to stop supporting Iran. Later<br />
   in the day, National Security Council chief<br />
   Nikolai Patrushev denied a report in Britain s<br />
   Sunday Times that stated Israel had confronted<br />
   Moscow with evidence that Russian scientists were<br />
   aiding Iran in the development of a nuclear weapons program.<br />
<br />
   Russia has been in a tense position since the<br />
   Geneva talks. Though the P-5+1 and Tehran reached<br />
   a tentative agreement to allow Irana**s nuclear<br />
   facilities to be inspected, under the authority<br />
   of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA),<br />
   Washington and Tehran are still heading toward a<br />
   crisis. At the heart of this crisis is Russia: It<br />
   is Russia that is helping Iran with its civilian<br />
   nuclear program, and Russia is the country that<br />
   could undermine the effectiveness of U.S.<br />
   sanctions against Iran. Moscow also occasionally<br />
   raises the specter of more significant military<br />
   assistance to Iran, in the form of modern<br />
   strategic air defense systems like the S-300.<br />
<br />
   a**If Russia was directly linked to the crisis, it<br />
   would wreck Moscowa**s ability to negotiate not<br />
   only with the United States but with the West as a whole, including<br />
   Europe.a**<br />
<br />
   In the past week, a flurry of leaks has escalated<br />
   tensions between the United States and Iran.<br />
   There was a leak from the IAEA stating that<br />
   Irana**s nuclear program is much more advanced than<br />
   previously thought, as well as leaks from the<br />
   United States that the government is re-examining<br />
   its intelligence estimates on Irana**s program. But<br />
   what was really interesting was the leak about<br />
   Israela**s evidence that Russia is helping Iran<br />
   with its nuclear weapons program (instead of<br />
   nuclear energy for civilian purposes). This leak<br />
   not only heightened the sense of an impending<br />
   crisis between the United States and Iran, but<br />
   also pointed a finger directly at Russia.<br />
<br />
   Yet Russia was silent for a week after the Geneva<br />
   talks, and for three days after the Sunday Times<br />
   reported the accusations against it. But the silence has now been broken.<br />
<br />
   The Russians took their time deciding how to<br />
   respond on all fronts. As expected, Moscow denied<br />
   that it was helping Iran develop a weapons<br />
   program. For Russia to achieve its goal, it must<br />
   be seen as supportive of Iran, but not as the<br />
   cause of the turmoil between Washington and<br />
   Tehran. If Russia was directly linked to the<br />
   crisis, it would wreck Moscowa**s ability to<br />
   negotiate not only with the United States but<br />
   with the West as a whole, including Europe.<br />
<br />
   While Russia distances itself from the leaked<br />
   Israeli accusation, it is the statement from<br />
   Borodavkin that is critical. Russia is reserving<br />
   the right to continue its military relationship<br />
   with Iran, despite the U.S. and Israeli demands<br />
   to stop. Russia is pushing the United States into a dilemma.<br />
<br />
   Moscow sees three possible outcomes of the crisis.<br />
<br />
   First, the United States could try to cut a deal<br />
   with the Russians: Washington would concede on<br />
   issues in Moscowa**s sphere of influence, in<br />
   exchange for Russia backing away from Iran. But<br />
   the United States would have to give up much more<br />
   than missile defense in Europe. Russia wants<br />
   control in the former Soviet sphere and in Europe.<br />
<br />
   The second possible outcome would be the United<br />
   States backing down on the Iran issue, which<br />
   Russia would see as a very public demonstration of Washingtona**s<br />
   weakness.<br />
<br />
   The third possibility is that the United States<br />
   would take military action against Iran and get<br />
   involved in a third war in the Middle East. The<br />
   Russians believe that as long as Washington is<br />
   focused on Iran, it cannot also be focused on their actions.<br />
<br />
   Moscow is playing a complex and dangerous game<br />
   with Iran and the United States. For the past<br />
   several years, Russia has made it clear to the<br />
   United States that it wanted Washington to quit<br />
   meddling in its periphery and recognize Russia as<br />
   the predominant Eurasian power. The United<br />
   States, under the previous and current<br />
   administrations, ignored Russiaa**s demands. Russia<br />
   has proven recently A through the August 2008<br />
   Russo-Georgian war, for example A that it cannot<br />
   be ignored. As it seeks to push back against the<br />
   United States, Moscow does not see a downside to<br />
   the U.S.-Iranian crisis, except possibly one: A<br />
   short, sharp air and naval campaign that hurls<br />
   Iran back a generation, combined with a U.S.<br />
   pullout from Iraq and Afghanistan, would leave<br />
   Russia without its Iran card, and looking at an<br />
   angry United States that has a very free hand.<br />

   Expert on China's Role in the World, Problems, Relations With Russia, US<br />
<br />
   Izvestia<br />
   October 2, 2009<br />
   Article by Ivan Antonov under the rubric<br />
   &quot;Politics&quot;: &quot;China: Has It Caught Up With and Passed America?&quot;<br />
<br />
   On Thursday the People's Republic of China<br />
   celebrated its most important holiday -- the 60th<br />
   anniversary of the day of its formation. Yevgeniy<br />
   Bazhanov, the prorector (chancellor) for academic<br />
   work at the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs<br />
   Diplomatic Academy, told the Izvestiya<br />
   correspondent about China's place in the<br />
   contemporary world, its prospects, and relations with Russia.<br />
<br />
   (Antonov) Just what is contemporary China?<br />
<br />
   (Bazhanov) China is one of the largest countries<br />
   and one of the leaders in the world economy, a<br />
   state which is becoming increasingly significant<br />
   politically and without which it is virtually<br />
   impossible today to resolve even one<br />
   international problem. Whether it is some local<br />
   conflict, nonproliferation of nuclear weapons, or economic questions.<br />
<br />
   Generally speaking it is acountry that already<br />
   can be called a superpower, but not in the sense<br />
   that it holds sway over everyone, but from the<br />
   standpoint of influence. As for China's plans,<br />
   the Chinese themselves claim that they are not<br />
   seeking hegemony and do not want to put pressure on others or command<br />
   anyone.<br />
<br />
   At this point it is still too early to say<br />
   whether that will be the case or not. In<br />
   principle, there are scholars who are watching<br />
   China's rise cautiously, assuming that as soon as<br />
   it becomes really strong, it will immediately<br />
   begin to project its might on others. I believe<br />
   that we must proceed from reality, and this is<br />
   how it is: Beijing is now following a<br />
   peace-loving policy; it is interested in<br />
   friendship with Moscow and is doing everything<br />
   possible to strengthen relations with us; it is<br />
   not observed in any actions that are contrary to<br />
   our interests; it is not concentrating troops on<br />
   the border; it is not entering into any<br />
   anti-Russian alliances; and it is trying to build up bilateral contacts.<br />
<br />
   (Antonov) Many people are now suggesting that<br />
   China needs to participate more actively in<br />
   international affairs. Do you agree with that?<br />
<br />
   (Bazhanov) In China itself too, there are a<br />
   considerable number of scholars who are saying<br />
   that they are behaving too timidly and there is<br />
   no way that they will get over the complex of the<br />
   past. More and more appeals are heard to follow<br />
   the example of others, of that same Great<br />
   Britain, which cannot be compared with the PRC in<br />
   terms of potential but plays an appreciable role<br />
   in the international arena. But so far Beijing is<br />
   following a cautious, flexible policy, and thanks<br />
   to that it has managed not to aggravate relations<br />
   with its neighbors; and it stands aside in<br />
   conflicts that do not affect China directly,<br />
   concentrating on domestic problems, and as we<br />
   know, there are a considerable number of them. So<br />
   in this context the PRC can serve as an example<br />
   -- if we want to work on modernization and<br />
   development, we must conduct ourselves more<br />
   inventively in international affairs. But all the<br />
   same there are a lot of issues for China. The<br />
   enormous country is growing, the balance of<br />
   forces is changing, the population is colossal,<br />
   and the economy is powerful; and this is the way<br />
   it goes -- anyone who becomes stronger<br />
   immediately arouses fears. So their neighbors are beginning to be fearful.<br />
<br />
   (Antonov) Since we have already touched on<br />
   China's problems, let us dwell on them in more<br />
   detail. What specifically do you mean?<br />
<br />
   (Bazhanov) An entire bouquet of problems exists,<br />
   and they need to work on all of them. In the<br />
   first place, Xinjiang and Tibet -- they are the<br />
   most volatile regions. Although the population<br />
   there by China's standards is not even very<br />
   significant, all the same they are enormous<br />
   lands, border territories that can more easily<br />
   break away. Plus external forces frequently stand behind them.<br />
<br />
   The second group of problems consists of social<br />
   ones. The top one among them is the property<br />
   stratification of the population. Some of them<br />
   have become rich (above all party leaders), while<br />
   for others, the large part, life is very hard.<br />
   There is extremely high unemployment, especially<br />
   among the peasants. They flee to the cities, and<br />
   there no one needs them and sometimes they simply<br />
   work for food. At the same time, another threat<br />
   also exists -- corruption at all levels -- from<br />
   the police to the party nomenklatura. Right here<br />
   is where the question of the unequal development of certain regions comes<br />
   in.<br />
<br />
   Yet another sphere of problems consists of the<br />
   demographic ones. The nation is getting older,<br />
   there is no proper pension support, and soon a<br />
   shortage of workers will be felt and an enormous<br />
   army of pensioners will have to be fed, but there<br />
   is no money for it. The PRC has never encountered<br />
   such issues before. A serious complicating factor<br />
   is the shortage of resources. There is not enough<br />
   oil and gas, and more and more is needed, and at<br />
   this point there are no reliable sources. The<br />
   main ones are concentrated in Central Asia and<br />
   the Persian Gulf, and they are far away. A navy<br />
   is needed to guarantee deliveries. The shortage<br />
   of timber, pasture lands, and so forth can be<br />
   brought up here too. Many enterprises are still<br />
   not very efficient and they are being closed,<br />
   thereby raising unemployment. China's GDP is<br />
   impressive, but from the standpoint of<br />
   technologies, it still has a long way to go to<br />
   become a leader. We must not forget about ecology<br />
   either: 16 of the 20 dirtiest cities in the world<br />
   are Chinese. Generally speaking, there are difficulties in abundance.<br />
<br />
   (Antonov) Some people are of the opinion that<br />
   China is rapidly &quot;becoming Westernized.&quot; In what<br />
   way might that threaten the PRC?<br />
<br />
   (Bazhanov) This is one of the aspects. One part<br />
   of the population is pushing society to copy the<br />
   Western way of life -- above all young people and<br />
   the intelligentsia are being subjected to this<br />
   influence. Another part -- the so-called working<br />
   masses --is in the thrall of leftist ideology. As<br />
   the Chinese leaders themselves say, the leading<br />
   role belongs to the Communist Party, but even its<br />
   success depends on how long the rapid economic<br />
   development continues. If the situation suddenly<br />
   begins to break down, the question immediately<br />
   arises of whether the Chinese Communist Party has<br />
   the right to continue to govern the country. In<br />
   addition, the influence of Taiwan, Hong Kong, and<br />
   so forth remains. So there are many ideological<br />
   vectors of development in China now. For example,<br />
   the cult of Mao is now popular among young<br />
   people. People of the older generation-- 40-45<br />
   years of age -- have a different attitude toward<br />
   the Great Helmsman and criticize him. But then<br />
   the young generation does not remember the bad<br />
   things and idealizes Mao and the past when<br />
   everyone was equal. It is a very diverse palette.<br />
<br />
   (Antonov) How are relations between China and the<br />
   United States developing now?<br />
<br />
   (Bazhanov) I would like to quote Mao Zedong, who<br />
   once made this comment regarding Soviet-American<br />
   contacts: &quot;They fight and they find agreement.&quot;<br />
   The same thing can probably be said of Beijing<br />
   and Washington. In the United States, they are<br />
   already talking about a bipolar world. The<br />
   unipolar one did not work out, so now, they say,<br />
   let us share the burden of responsibility with<br />
   the Heavenly Kingdom. That is impossible. Why?<br />
   Because it is the latest American chimera, just<br />
   like the conflict of civilizations and the end of<br />
   history. Because the PRC and the United States<br />
   are not only partners but also rivals. Especially<br />
   in the Asia-Pacific Region. China is getting<br />
   stronger and the balance of forces is changing,<br />
   and most of all that disturbs the United States<br />
   in particular, not New Zealand and South Korea;<br />
   after all it was the hegemon there before. Now<br />
   its dominance is being undermined, and Japan is<br />
   already trading more with the PRC than with<br />
   America. Washington, needless to say, does not<br />
   like that, so it is constantly coming into conflict with Beijing.<br />
<br />
   The modernization of China's armed forces<br />
   seriously alarms the Americans. We also see<br />
   friction over Iran and Africa. Secondly, from the<br />
   standpoint of the Chinese, the United States is<br />
   interfering in the PRC's internal affairs in<br />
   order to weaken China's progress along the path<br />
   of development and perhaps even break it up, the<br />
   way it turned out with the Soviet Union. The<br />
   Chinese themselves cite Xinjiang as an example--<br />
   not only Hollywood actors but also the CIA and<br />
   the US government overall are involved there.<br />
<br />
   One other reason that a bipolar world is<br />
   impossible: neither Washington nor Beijing can<br />
   simply make the grade as a leader. The United<br />
   States is undergoing a very tough economic and<br />
   political crisis and has become bogged down in<br />
   Iraq and Afghanistan. China is also not yet ready<br />
   for the role of world leader -- it is still not a<br />
   power than can decide for everyone. In the first<br />
   place, it is all the same still a very poor<br />
   country (in terms of GDP per capita, the PRC is<br />
   not among the 100 leading states in the world).<br />
   Secondly, China is weighed down with an entire<br />
   set of domestic problems. Thirdly, it is a state<br />
   that does not have very many allies, so there<br />
   certainly can be no question of some kind of<br />
   camp. Fourthly, Beijing is by no means yet a<br />
   leader in the fields of science, technology, and<br />
   mass culture. In other words, in those areas that<br />
   can attract the entire world. GDP is the second<br />
   highest in the world, but there are no brands<br />
   similar to Mercedes. The entire planet is<br />
   familiar even the South Korean makes like<br />
   Hyundai, but then you cannot name any Chinese ones off the top of your<br />
   head.<br />
<br />
   (Antonov) And what should we expect from China?<br />
<br />
   (Bazhanov) Above all, don't speculate about the<br />
   future and tremble from fear and say that China<br />
   intends to conquer us. At the start of the last<br />
   century, the &quot;yellow peril&quot; was often mentioned<br />
   in our country too, but in the meantime we had to<br />
   fight twice with Western powers. Today there is<br />
   every reason to develop stable, good relations<br />
   with the PRC. China is for a multipolar world,<br />
   and it needs us as partners. And besides that<br />
   Beijing has a lot of its own problems: with Japan<br />
   and Taiwan. It is important to it to have a<br />
   partner on these issues. One other factor is<br />
   reforms. When we were Communists, we considered<br />
   each other enemies, but now, despite the fact<br />
   that we have different ideologies, our points of<br />
   view on many questions coincide. Now both of us<br />
   are conducting reforms. The complementary nature<br />
   of our economies certainly must not be forgotten.<br />
   Without such countries as China, it will be<br />
   difficult to develop Siberia and the Far East.<br />

   COST OF THE MATTER<br />
   Political scientist: There are really no<br />
   unsolvable problems in the Russian-Ukrainian relations<br />
   Author: Boris Makarenko (Political Techniques Center)<br />
   TIME TO FORM A NEW RUSSIAN-UKRAINIAN AGENDA<br />
<br />
         Yuschenko is no friend of Russia. Ditto Saakashvili. As for<br />
   Lukashenko in Minsk, the niceties he has been exchanging with<br />
   Moscow leave a lot of questions concerning the true nature of the<br />
   Russian-Belarussian relations. All of that smacks of a trend. And<br />
   yet, Ukraine is a special case. Lukashenko remains the sole master<br />
   of Belarus. There is no saying who may replace him or when.<br />
   Saakashvili's repute in the eyes of Georgian society is smeared,<br />
   but the question of who may come after him is baffling. Yuschenko<br />
   in the meantime is a leader Russia's relations with have always<br />
   been strained. Anyway, he is undeniably a lame duck of Ukrainian<br />
   politics, and errors of his foreign policy are not the only<br />
   explanation of this lameness. He really accomplished one thing<br />
   only: Ukraine developed political competition during his reign. In<br />
   a word, that voters will punish Yuschenko for all this<br />
   shortcomings is clear. Who will be elected the new president and<br />
   what it will mean for the Ukrainian-Russian relations will be<br />
   clear soon enough.<br />
         All of that makes the future of the Russian-Ukrainian<br />
   relations both clearer and more obscure. How someone else will<br />
   come to power in Kiev and when is known. This person's agenda,<br />
   however, remains unknown.<br />
         So, what shall Russia do? First, it must try and refrain from<br />
   making the same old mistake. It is as wrong to pamper one<br />
   political force in Ukraine as it is to condemn all others and<br />
   refuse to have anything to do with them. Second, it should always<br />
   remember that Russia and Ukraine are inseparably intertwined and<br />
   depend on each other. Any gas conflict affects both countries.<br />
   Discounting objective discord and subjective grievances, both<br />
   countries depend on Russian gas export via Ukraine. Third, it is<br />
   time for Russia to realize that Ukraine is a sovereign state now<br />
   and to start treating it as one.<br />
         Ukraine, too, should learn a lesson or two. For starters, it<br />
   is wrong to emphasize one's maturity and sovereignty by efforts to<br />
   spite a neighbor with no other possible justification.<br />
         In short, there are really no unsolvable problems in the<br />
   Russian-Ukrainian relations. Both countries should start<br />
   formulating a new agenda of the bilateral relations.<br />

   OSC [US Open Source Center] Report: Ukraine --<br />
   Tensions With Russia Over Black Sea Fleet<br />
   October 6, 2009<br />
<br />
   Relations between Ukraine and Russia in recent<br />
   months have deteriorated based in part on<br />
   military activities of the Sevastopol-based<br />
   Russian Black Sea Fleet (BSF RF). Ukrainian<br />
   officials complained that the BSF RF's actions<br />
   are illegal and intentional provocations. Soured<br />
   diplomatic relations have resulted in Moscow's<br />
   refusal to send the newly appointed Russian<br />
   ambassador to Ukraine. Russian President Dmitriy<br />
   Medvedev blamed Ukrainian President Viktor<br />
   Yushchenko for the breakdown in relations. Some<br />
   observers warned of a possible Russian military provocation in Crimea.<br />
<br />
   A series of incidents in Sevastopol in recent<br />
   months has increased tensions and soured<br />
   diplomatic relations between Ukraine and Russia.<br />
<br />
   Sevastopol State Motor Vehicle Inspection (DAI)<br />
   officers reported that on three separate<br />
   occasions in July the BSF RF was intercepted<br />
   transporting Mirage cruise missiles from unit to<br />
   unit in densely populated areas without the<br />
   required security escort and permits from<br />
   Ukrainian authorities (Ukrayinska Pravda, 23 July).<br />
<br />
   Sevastopol DAI intercept a cruise missile being<br />
   transported by the BSF RF (Ukrayinska Pravda, 23 July).<br />
<br />
   The Ukrainian National Security and Defense<br />
   Council (NSDC) stated on its website that by<br />
   transporting the cruise missiles without<br />
   Ukrainian permission, the Russian Black Sea Fleet<br />
   is being &quot;intentionally disrespectful of<br />
   Ukrainian national sovereignty.&quot; The NSDC said<br />
   that such actions were becoming a regular<br />
   occurrence devised to increase tensions between Ukraine and Russia (<br />
   http://www.rainbow.gov.ua/ www.rainbow.gov.ua, 24 July).<br />
<br />
   The conflict over actions of the BSF RF in<br />
   Sevastopol in July precipitated the expulsion of<br />
   diplomats by both Ukraine and Russia. Vsevolod<br />
   Loskutov, Charge de Affairs of the Russian<br />
   Embassy in Ukraine, subsequently declared that<br />
   the new ambassador to Ukraine, Mikhail Zurabov,<br />
   will not be dispatched to Ukraine until Russia<br />
   sees a change in Ukraine's political course (Izvestiya, 18 September).<br />
<br />
   Russians Insist Fleet To Stay<br />
<br />
   Ukrainian authorities have repeatedly stated that<br />
   the BSF RF is expected to withdraw from<br />
   Sevastopol in 2017, and President Yushchenko<br />
   reaffirmed this as recently as 20 September in an<br />
   address on the national television channel UT 1.<br />
   Some Russian officials, however, have insisted the fleet will stay.<br />
<br />
   . Navy Commander-in-Chief Vladimir Vysotskiy<br />
   asserted, &quot;We believe it is desirable and<br />
   justifiable to base a part of the main forces of<br />
   the BSF in Sevastopol after 2017.&quot; He claimed<br />
   that Ukrainian leaders -- both the president and<br />
   the prime minister -- never said unequivocally<br />
   that the BSF RF should leave and that current<br />
   calls by Ukrainian politicians for the BSF RF to<br />
   leave by 2017 are &quot;thoughtless, shortsighted, and<br />
   won't lead to anything good&quot; (RIA-Novosti, 26<br />
   July; Ukrayinska Pravda, 27 July).<br />
<br />
   . In an interview on Ukraine's most popular<br />
   television channel, Inter TV, former head of<br />
   intelligence of the BSF RF Vladimir Solovyov<br />
   asserted, &quot;We shall not leave in 2017&quot; (Flot<br />
   Ukrayiny, 16 September). Russians Blame Yushchenko<br />
<br />
   Russian President Dmitriy Medvedev and former<br />
   Ambassador to Ukraine Viktor Chernomyrdin both<br />
   have placed the blame on deteriorating relations<br />
   between the two nations solidly at President Viktor Yuschenko's feet.<br />
<br />
   In August Medvedev wrote a scathing letter of<br />
   complaint directed against Yushchenko, charging<br />
   that the Ukrainian president's policies were<br />
   intentionally anti-Russian, and in a recent<br />
   address to students at the University of<br />
   Pittsburgh, Medvedev stated that he blamed<br />
   Yushchenko for &quot;not doing enough to develop<br />
   relations with Russia&quot; and, in fact, steering<br />
   relations &quot;in a direction not in the best<br />
   interests of the two nations&quot; (Kremlin.ru, 25 September).<br />
<br />
   At a news conference in Sochi, Medvedev stated<br />
   that he saw no prospect for the improvement of<br />
   relations between Russia and Ukraine under the<br />
   current leadership and expressed hope that the<br />
   new leadership &quot;will have quite a number of<br />
   possibilities to significantly improve our relations&quot; (ITAR-TASS, 14<br />
   August).<br />
<br />
   In a recent interview, former Russian Ambassador<br />
   to Ukraine Viktor Chernomyrdin asserted, &quot;in the<br />
   time of Viktor Yushchenko's presidency, the fact<br />
   of the matter is that our relations have<br />
   deteriorated as never before&quot; (Moskovskiy Komsomolets, 24 September).<br />
<br />
   Media, Observers Debate Chances of Military Conflict<br />
<br />
   Some Ukrainian observers have claimed that if all<br />
   other Kremlin methods fail, and especially if the<br />
   new president of Ukraine to be elected in January<br />
   2010 turns out to be uncooperative with Moscow,<br />
   the use of force cannot be excluded.<br />
<br />
   Prominent Ukrainian political analysts Volodymyr<br />
   Horbulin, former head of the NSDC, and Oleksandr<br />
   Lytvynenko of the Kyiv Institute of Problems of<br />
   National Security claimed that if the January<br />
   2010 Ukrainian presidential election does not<br />
   yield the results Moscow wants, &quot;one cannot<br />
   completely exclude the application of direct<br />
   force.&quot; Horbulin and Lytvynenko contend that &quot;key<br />
   among Russia's foreign policy tasks is to return<br />
   Ukraine to its orbit within the next five years.&quot;<br />
   They assert that Russia plans to split Ukraine<br />
   into three parts, the east and south will be<br />
   merged with Russia, the center will have a<br />
   pro-Russian government and the west, where<br />
   pro-independence sentiments are strong, will be<br />
   isolated from the rest of the country (Dzerkalo Tyzhnya, 19 September).<br />
<br />
   The independent Kyiv Post cautioned that Russia<br />
   may go as far as using a provocation by<br />
   pro-Russian groups in Crimea as a pretext for<br />
   intervention on the peninsula in order to<br />
   maintain the BSF RF presence there beyond 2017.<br />
   The publication called attention to a bill<br />
   recently passed in the Russian parliament which<br />
   provides a legal basis for &quot;defending&quot; Russian<br />
   citizens abroad by use of force (24 September).<br />
<br />
   Political analyst Oleksandr Derhachov declared<br />
   that while both Ukraine and Russia are<br />
   responsible for the worsening of their bilateral<br />
   relations, Russia is neither willing nor ready to<br />
   treat Ukraine as a full-fledged independent<br />
   country. He asserted the Kremlin is taking<br />
   advantage of Ukraine's weaknesses, most<br />
   importantly, Ukraine's &quot;weak political elite who<br />
   are not ready to protect national interests.&quot;<br />
   Derchachov opined that there will be more<br />
   confrontation or a &quot;very complex game&quot; played out<br />
   in Ukrainian-Russian relations (Den, 14 September).<br />
<br />
   Similarly, leader of Russia's opposition Svoboda<br />
   Party Yuriy Belayev asserted that &quot;the entirety<br />
   of Russia's policy toward Ukraine is founded on<br />
   aggression.&quot; He said that this line of policy<br />
   will continue because, &quot;in order to stay in<br />
   power, Russia needs continuing conflict&quot; and one<br />
   source of conflict between Russia and Ukraine is<br />
   the status of Sevastopol. Belayev stated that<br />
   &quot;Russian media constantly escalates the rhetoric<br />
   against Ukraine...it is obvious that they are<br />
   preparing for something very serious&quot; (UNIAN, 23 September).<br />
<br />
   Other political observers have opined, however,<br />
   that while Russia may desire to use force against<br />
   Ukraine, its military is currently in no position to do so.<br />
<br />
   Sevastopol-based defense analyst Dmytro<br />
   Shtyblikov, in an article entitled &quot;Russian<br />
   Citizens Are Being Prepared for a War With<br />
   Ukraine,&quot; stated that Russia is not likely to<br />
   agree to withdraw its fleet from Crimea in 2017<br />
   but for the time being it does not have &quot;the<br />
   means to create a numerical and armed advantage<br />
   to carry out operations in Crimea&quot; in order to<br />
   engage in a full-fledged war with Ukraine (Flot Ukrayiny, 16 September).<br />
<br />
   Anti-Kremlin Russian military expert Pavel<br />
   Felgengauer agreed that &quot;while Russia may want to<br />
   invade and may have the legal ability to do so,&quot;<br />
   the Russian military is in such poor shape that<br />
   &quot;it will not be ready to invade Ukraine for at<br />
   least another three years but more likely, five<br />
   to ten years&quot; (Glavred, 10 September).<br />
<br />
   The independent daily Gazeta Po-Kiyevski opined<br />
   the possibility of a military conflict between<br />
   Ukraine and Russia over the Crimean peninsula is<br />
   &quot;unlikely&quot; because Moscow would risk losing its<br />
   Crimean investments and spur anti-Russian<br />
   sentiments across Ukraine but cautioned that &quot;a<br />
   Ukrainian-Russian confrontation could lead to an<br />
   unplanned armed conflict. Only a small spark is<br />
   required...and an armed conflict, undesired by<br />
   either, could be the result and it would be an<br />
   explosion more terrifying than South Ossetia&quot; (31 August).<br />
<br />
   Despite some observers' predictions of a Russian<br />
   use of force, the Ukrainian president and other<br />
   officials insist that there is no imminent danger<br />
   of armed conflict between the two nations.<br />
<br />
   President Yushchenko told Ukrainian media that<br />
   there will not be a war between Ukraine and<br />
   Russia and that the loss of Ukrainian<br />
   independence &quot;is out of the question&quot; (Kommersant-Ukraina, 1 September).<br />
   Valentyn Nalyvaychenko, head of Ukraine's<br />
   Security Service (SBU), asserted that it is not<br />
   possible that the current increase of tensions<br />
   between Ukraine and Russia will result in the<br />
   &quot;the use of force in Crimea&quot; (31 August, Glavred).<br />
<br />
   Anatoliy Hrytsenko, chairman of the Rada's<br />
   National Security and Defense Committee, also<br />
   rejected speculations about a possible war<br />
   between Ukraine and Russia. He asserted that war<br />
   between the two countries would be a &quot;disaster<br />
   for the whole of Europe&quot; considering the &quot;number<br />
   of nuclear power plants, river dams, chemical and<br />
   other facilities in Ukraine and the European part<br />
   of Russia&quot; (Ukrayinska Pravda, 14 September).<br />
<br />
   Rada speaker Volodymyr Lytvyn stated that there<br />
   is no danger of a military threat. He said,<br />
   &quot;everyone understands very well what the reaction<br />
   of the world will be even if we hypothetically<br />
   imagine such an extreme situation&quot; (UkrInform, 15 September).<br />

   New Hope in Caucasus Spat<br />
   By Andrei Kortunov<br />
   Andrei Kortunov is president of the New Eurasia Foundation in Moscow.<br />
<br />
   It was clear from the beginning that the<br />
   Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe<br />
   would not vote for the initiative that would have<br />
   denied Russia its voting rights in the organization.<br />
<br />
   But what is most interesting about the resolution<br />
   is what it revealed about each European countrya**s<br />
   attitude toward Russia. Poland and the Baltic<br />
   states comprise a bloc in Europe that advocates<br />
   taking a hard line with Russia, but they have<br />
   insufficient influence to force their position on<br />
   the moderate majority in the assembly.<br />
<br />
   That majority is not particularly thrilled with<br />
   Russiaa**s policies in general and its actions in<br />
   the Caucasus in particular, but it feels that it<br />
   would be counterproductive and even dangerous to<br />
   close this important diplomatic channel between<br />
   Russia and Europe, thereby irritating Moscow and<br />
   provoking a harsh and counterproductive reaction.<br />
<br />
   Of course, Moscow interpreted the Parliamentary<br />
   Assembly decision as Russiaa**s latest diplomatic<br />
   victory. It is difficult to judge to what extent<br />
   Russian diplomatic pressure influenced the final<br />
   vote, but this is irrelevant. Far more important<br />
   are the conclusions Moscow draws from the<br />
   decision. Its most likely response will be to do nothing at all.<br />
<br />
   The logic of the wait-and-see position is simple:<br />
   Time is working in Russiaa**s favor. The political<br />
   liability of the Caucasus conflict is fading into<br />
   the past and is being eclipsed by other problems<br />
   and conflicts. European countries have no other<br />
   choice but to work closely with the Kremlin, and<br />
   Russiaa**s main European partners A Germany, France<br />
   and Italy A will never allow the radical states<br />
   to make their point of view the predominant one<br />
   in Europe. As for Poland and the Baltic states,<br />
   they will never be completely satisfied, so the<br />
   best approach is to politely ignore them in those<br />
   instances when they go out of their way to spite<br />
   Russia instead of working to build better relations.<br />
<br />
   Despite its weaknesses, Parliamentary Assembly<br />
   resolutions offer a good opportunity to begin<br />
   discussions on the problems in the Caucasus with<br />
   European partners. This type of dialogue would<br />
   have been impossible a year ago because passions<br />
   were running too high last fall, and too many<br />
   questions were unresolved regarding the causes<br />
   and consequences of the Russia-Georgia war. Now<br />
   that those passions have cooled somewhat, Europe<br />
   favors a more measured and objective analysis of<br />
   what actually happened in August 2008. Attesting<br />
   to that is the recently published report by a<br />
   European Union commission that contains many points worthy of<br />
   consideration.<br />
<br />
   The South Caucasus will always be of interest to<br />
   Europeans because of its historical, cultural and<br />
   geopolitical importance. The region is clearly<br />
   more important for Russia, and its problems are<br />
   inseparably bound up with many of our own<br />
   domestic problems. But it seems that neither<br />
   Russia nor Europe has a long-term strategic<br />
   approach to the region. Russia, Georgia and<br />
   European institutions are in a deadlock over the<br />
   region, and the problem will not be resolved by<br />
   itself. It requires political will, perseverance<br />
   and the readiness to search for compromises with opponents.<br />
<br />
   If the Parliamentary Assembly resolution and the<br />
   EU-commissioned report can be considered as<br />
   positive gestures toward Russia, wouldna**t it be<br />
   appropriate to consider what gesture Russia could<br />
   make toward Europe in return? For example, Russia<br />
   could issue its own report giving a critical<br />
   reevaluation of its actions during the conflict.<br />
   It might also show greater flexibility when<br />
   discussing the problems of the region at the<br />
   United Nations Security Council, or to in some<br />
   way demonstrate its readiness for a substantive<br />
   and serious discussion of the South Caucasus with its European partners.<br />
<br />
   Clearly, these negotiations would not be<br />
   concluded quickly or easily. We have to take the<br />
   positions of Russiaa**s perennial and numerous<br />
   European opponents into consideration as well.<br />
   They might perceive Russian flexibility as a sign<br />
   of weakness and cause for stepping up pressure on Moscow.<br />
<br />
   Nonetheless, at this moment there is an<br />
   opportunity to move away from the long-standing<br />
   impasse over the Caucasus. Leta**s hope Russia doesna**t miss this chance.<br />

   After Russia-Georgia Report, A Sense Of 'What Now?'<br />
   By David Kakabadze, Marina Vashakmadze<br />
<br />
   The release last week of an EU report on the<br />
   August 2008 Russia-Georgia war is continuing to<br />
   draw cheers and rebukes respectively from many corners.<br />
<br />
   The report, drafted by an investigative team led<br />
   by Swiss diplomat Heidi Tagliavini, blamed<br />
   Georgia for initiating the five-day war but<br />
   suggested that both Moscow and Tbilisi shared<br />
   responsibility for bringing the long-simmering conflict to the boiling<br />
   point.<br />
<br />
   Among the report's critics is Lithuanian Foreign<br />
   Minister Vygaudas Usackas, who said the anger<br />
   over the war is still too fresh for the EU to attempt to apportion blame.<br />
<br />
   &quot;The wounds of the conflict and the war a year<br />
   ago are still very much alive,&quot; Usackas said<br />
   during a two-day trip to Tbilisi. &quot;And I think<br />
   what's happening now is that we're putting salt<br />
   on those wounds, which I don't think is helpful,<br />
   having in mind that we're now in a situation<br />
   where we have to deal with post-conflict resolution.&quot;<br />
<br />
   Both the Russians and the Georgians have<br />
   attempted to claim victory in the report's myriad findings.<br />
<br />
   But the first media headlines following the<br />
   document's presentation on September 30 saw a<br />
   tactical defeat for Tbilisi in the EU's<br />
   conclusion that Georgia officially started the<br />
   war by firing the first shot -- shelling the<br />
   breakaway region of South Ossetia on the night of August 7.<br />
<br />
   The BBC and others led with headlines citing the<br />
   report's statement that Georgia had started an &quot;unjustified war.&quot;<br />
<br />
   Russian officials quickly stated the report<br />
   delivered an &quot;unequivocal answer&quot; on who was to<br />
   blame. Russia's NATO ambassador, Dmitry Rogozin,<br />
   went so far as to suggest the West owed the<br />
   Kremlin an apology for its condemnation of Russia's actions during the<br />
   war.<br />
<br />
   Moscow Not Spared<br />
<br />
   Ron Asmus, the head of the German Marshall Fund<br />
   in Brussels, said the report, in its entirety, is really more nuanced.<br />
<br />
   &quot;This report is written in a way that different<br />
   parties will emphasize different parts of it<br />
   which they think confirm their position,&quot; Asmus<br />
   said. &quot;If I was sitting in the Kremlin, though, I<br />
   wouldn't want people to read the report too<br />
   closely, because the more I re-read it, the more<br />
   there is criticism of various aspects of Russian policy.&quot;<br />
<br />
   The report, among other things, rejects Moscow's<br />
   claims that it was attempting to prevent<br />
   &quot;genocide&quot; by entering South Ossetia and eventually moving in Georgia<br />
   proper.<br />
<br />
   The report says Russia's retaliation to the<br />
   August 7 Georgian assault went &quot;far beyond the reasonable limits of<br />
   defense.&quot;<br />
<br />
   Asmus said the report &quot;was much tougher on Russia than people expected.&quot;<br />
<br />
   Still, Asmus -- who served as a U.S. deputy<br />
   assistant secretary of state under Bill Clinton<br />
   -- said focusing on who's to blame is not nearly<br />
   as important as ensuring that the same mistakes aren't repeated.<br />
<br />
   The first war, said Asmus, began because Georgian<br />
   President Mikheil Saakashvili wanted to go West and Russia wanted to stop<br />
   him.<br />
<br />
   A year later, those basics haven't changed:<br />
   Tbilisi is still actively yearning for NATO and<br />
   EU membership, and Russia is still keen to keep<br />
   Georgia within its sphere of influence.<br />
<br />
   Preventing Round Two<br />
<br />
   Even if Saakashvili's actions had disastrous<br />
   consequences, Asmus said, the months of Russian<br />
   sanctions and military buildup that preceded the<br />
   war help explain why he acted the way he did.<br />
<br />
   It also explains why a future such conflict can't<br />
   necessarily be ruled out -- especially as Russia<br />
   continues to build ties with Abkhazia and South<br />
   Ossetia and sends coast guard boats into the<br />
   Black Sea to protect Abkhaz vessels from what it<br />
   terms &quot;Georgian provocations.&quot;<br />
<br />
   &quot;I think it's part of a pattern of threats and<br />
   warnings from Moscow, that if you, Georgia,<br />
   continue to go West, you will pay the price and<br />
   suffer the consequences,&quot; said Asmus.<br />
<br />
   &quot;That, followed by a pattern of escalation and<br />
   intimidation, until President Saakashvili felt<br />
   cornered and felt he had no choice but to act.<br />
   You can still say his decision was wrong, but why<br />
   he did it was not a great mystery for me.&quot;<br />
<br />
   Usackas, the Lithuanian foreign minister, said<br />
   the best steps now are to keep Georgia on a<br />
   steady path of reform, encourage Russia to<br />
   respect its original cease-fire commitments,<br />
   ensure the safe return of people displaced by the<br />
   war, and allowing EU monitors to work in South Ossetia and Abkhazia.<br />
<br />
   Usackas said the European Union and the United<br />
   States cannot escape criticism for their own<br />
   failure to prevent the war. He said the West must<br />
   be more &quot;aggressive&quot; in favoring preemptive<br />
   diplomacy over postconflict resolution.<br />
<br />
   &quot;Why, in the 21st century, did we allow two<br />
   members of the Council of Europe and the OSCE to<br />
   go to war? What did these organizations do to<br />
   prevent it -- and if there was something we<br />
   didn't do, why not?&quot; he asked. &quot;I believe we<br />
   weren't sufficiently generous, we didn't have<br />
   sufficient foresight, and we didn't use the preventive means we had.&quot;<br />

   US Radio Mouthpiece To Launch Programs For Akbkhazia, S Ossetia<br />
<br />
   WASHINGTON, October 7 (Itar-Tass) - Radio Free<br />
   Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL), a broadcasting<br />
   organization sponsored by the U.S.<br />
   Administration, plans launching programs for the<br />
   Republic of Abkhazia and the Republic of South<br />
   Ossetia, Martins Zvaners, the associate director<br />
   for communications of the Prague-based station told Itar-Tass in<br />
   Washington.<br />
<br />
   A 60-minutes-long daily program targeted at the<br />
   two former regions of Georgia is due to go on the<br />
   air as of November 2. It will be co-produced by<br />
   the Russian and Georgian boards of the station in Prague.<br />
   According to Zvaners, RFE/RL plans to attract<br />
   reporters from Abkhazia, South Ossetia, Georgia,<br />
   and Russia to providing stories for the broadcasts.<br />
<br />
   Earlier, an Internet portal in Prague said RFE/RL<br />
   staff member Andrei Babitsky, who has made his<br />
   name notorious in the past by interviewing the<br />
   terrorist Shamil Basayev, will coordinate the new program.<br />
   Zvaners confirmed on his part that Babitsky has a<br />
   position in this program but it is an open<br />
   question yet whether he will chair the whole project.<br />
<br />
   Zvaners also claimed that the broadcasts for<br />
   Abkhazia and South Ossetia will have a classical<br />
   format consisting of newscasts with account of the listeners' interests.<br />
<br />
   The objective of this programming is<br />
   reconciliation and the bridging of different<br />
   viewpoints expressed by the parties to the<br />
   processes that are unfolding in the region, the executive claimed.<br />
<br />
   Doubts over the latter postulation arise,<br />
   however, from the fact that the stance of the<br />
   U.S. Administration of the problems of Abkhazia<br />
   and South Ossetia remains one-sided and prejudiced.<br />
<br />
   The new project per se testifies to the validity<br />
   of apprehensions about its nature.<br />
<br />
   Following the end of the Cold War and the loss of<br />
   the previous ideological platform of their<br />
   existence, U.S. propaganda mouthpieces have been<br />
   waging a fight for survival, which means the preserving of budget<br />
   allocations.<br />
<br />
   This prompts RFE/RL and other &quot;radio voices&quot; to<br />
   seek out hotbeds of tensions in the post-Soviet<br />
   space where the White House might need the application of their efforts.<br />
<br />
   The slogan waved in these situations suggests<br />
   that the target audiences in &quot;strained&quot; areas<br />
   thus get information free from censorship<br />
   although, quite naturally, all the reporting<br />
   reflects the U.S. position to a big degree.<br />

   Georgia's Russian roulette<br />
   Saakashvili gave an illegal order to attack<br />
   Russian troops and says he would do the same<br />
   again given the chance a** he must go<br />
   By Nino Burjanadze<br />
   Nino Burjanadze is a former speaker of the<br />
   Georgian parliament and was twice, in that<br />
   capacity, acting President of Georgia. She is now<br />
   an opposition leader and has been a strong<br />
   supporter of Georgia as a member of NATO and the<br />
   EU since the beginning of her political career in<br />
   1995. Like many in the Georgian opposition she<br />
   was initially a strong supporter of the Rose<br />
   Revolution and its promise of a democratic,<br />
   free-market and western orientated Georgia. Since<br />
   October 2008 she has led the Democratic Movement - United Georgia<br />
<br />
   Analogies between Georgia and the states of<br />
   western Europe are difficult to maintain: it is<br />
   precisely because the Euro-Atlantic community has<br />
   reached a maturity in its mutual relationships<br />
   that so many of us in Georgia want to be part of it.<br />
<br />
   But bear with me, please, on this.<br />
<br />
   Imagine if, last year, Britain and Spain had gone<br />
   to war over Gibraltar and a report commissioned<br />
   by the European Union into the conflict had just<br />
   been published. It said Spain fired the first<br />
   shots, in a clear breach of international law,<br />
   and that Britain's response a** to invade Spain and<br />
   to sponsor ethnic cleansing by Gibraltarian militias a** was equally<br />
   illegal.<br />
<br />
   Of course, in these circumstances, however<br />
   unlikely, Gordon Brown and Jose Luis Rodriguez<br />
   Zapatero would be finished as politicians before<br />
   the first news agency flashed its conclusions.<br />
   The House of Commons and the Cortes would be in<br />
   permanent session with parliamentarians of all<br />
   sides demanding explanations, apologies and<br />
   further resignations. The civil societies of both<br />
   lands would be alive with debate about how to<br />
   ensure such foolhardy and reckless acts were never to be repeated.<br />
<br />
   But what if the BBC or TVE did not mention the<br />
   report or simply said the other country was to<br />
   blame? What if the Daily Mail, or even the<br />
   Guardian, branded anyone who tried to explain<br />
   what was really said as an agent of the Spanish<br />
   government, while ABC or El Mundo did the opposite in Spain?<br />
<br />
   A small number of people might be able to read<br />
   the EU's report in the original German, but as<br />
   internet access is restricted to inner London and<br />
   Madrid, even German speakers have trouble<br />
   sourcing it. How can you protest about your<br />
   government's policies when you are not told what they are? You cannot.<br />
<br />
   And that is the reality in today's Georgia and<br />
   Russia. A report into the 2008 war between our<br />
   two countries has now been published. In any<br />
   democratic and free country political leaders<br />
   would have resigned out of shame before they<br />
   faced ejection in ignominy. But in both lands it<br />
   has been hailed as a government victory.<br />
<br />
   As a Georgian I have to confess I am not too<br />
   surprised about Russia. But as a leader of the<br />
   Rose Revolution that was carried out to create a<br />
   democratic Georgia and end corruption a** both<br />
   political and financial a** this situation makes me angry.<br />
<br />
   The Tagliavini report states in black and white<br />
   that our armed forces broke international law in<br />
   firing first and attacking peacekeeping troops.<br />
   Our president a** the man who gave the illegal<br />
   order to launch the attack a** simply says it does<br />
   not. Our media do not call him out as a liar, but<br />
   repeat his propaganda word for word.<br />
<br />
   I saw Mikheil Saakashvili days before he launched<br />
   that attack. In response to his broad hints that<br />
   he was about to start shelling Tskhinvali I told<br />
   him such a course of action would be madness. He<br />
   ignored me then and had his minions label me as<br />
   promoting Russian interests when I later told the world of our<br />
   conversation.<br />
<br />
   That lie, too, was repeated verbatim by our<br />
   media. The irony that their chief was the one who<br />
   gave the Russians the opportunity they had so<br />
   long desired to occupy Georgia and threaten the<br />
   fabric of our independence was either lost on<br />
   them or ignored, like every other inconvenient fact.<br />
<br />
   Heidi Tagliavini's report rightly condemns the<br />
   use of nationalist and xenophobic rhetoric by<br />
   politicians in the run-up to the war; we in<br />
   Georgia were deluged with it throughout 2008. But<br />
   that political sewage also required a sewer, and<br />
   that was found in a Georgian broadcast media<br />
   that, at a national level, is under the complete control of the<br />
   government.<br />
<br />
   Tbilisi has a thriving media and some internet<br />
   access and opposition voices can get a hearing in<br />
   newspapers and cable TV. But for two-thirds of<br />
   the country, our three national TV channels are<br />
   the only mass media available. And all are<br />
   directed by the president's inner circle.<br />
<br />
   Our public television channel is explicitly<br />
   government controlled. The second station is<br />
   partly owned by a government MP and, it has been<br />
   said, if it had been in Berlin and not Tbilisi<br />
   Germans would still think they had won the war.<br />
   Our third station used to be independent but was<br />
   seized by special forces in 2007 and later handed<br />
   over to cronies of the regime.<br />
<br />
   All of that needs to change if Georgia is to have<br />
   the checks and balances of informed public debate<br />
   that would put a break on a repeat performance of<br />
   August 2008. Today, basing his argument on the<br />
   lie that somehow he had no choice, Saakashvili<br />
   boasts he would indeed do the same again if he<br />
   got the chance. Every day he stays in office is<br />
   truly a game of Russian roulette for our country.<br />
<br />
   Tagliavini's report shows the Russian and<br />
   Georgian regimes were well matched.<br />
   Authoritarian, dangerous and ultimately reckless<br />
   in their approach to human life.<br />
<br />
   The west's leverage with Russia is limited but<br />
   with Georgia is great. EU and US money are now<br />
   vital to our economy. It's time western taxpayers<br />
   insisted that it was not being used to prop up<br />
   authoritarianism and it is time for Saakashvili<br />
   to pay the price his responsibility demands and to go.<br />

   When is a state not a state?<br />
   A no to South Ossetia but a yes to Kosovo a** the<br />
   Georgia conflict showed up international law's confusion over breakaway<br />
   states<br />
   By Ilana Bet-El<br />
   Ilana Bet-El is a writer, historian and political analyst<br />
<br />
   The confused web of international law and the<br />
   simmering global tensions beneath it have not<br />
   been resolved by the report of the Independent<br />
   Fact Finding Mission on the Conflict in Georgia.<br />
   In fact, the report only serves to emphasise that<br />
   the inadequacy of our politicians and<br />
   institutions to deal with the central issue of<br />
   our times: what, if any, are the agreed rules for<br />
   the making, breaking and interaction of states?<br />
<br />
   The report was commissioned by the Council of the<br />
   EU and undertaken by a team headed by Swiss<br />
   diplomat Heidi Tagliavini, and it is good. In<br />
   fact, it is more than that: in an international<br />
   field generally characterised by increasing<br />
   mediocrity, it is a rare gem that takes in the<br />
   historical and cultural perspectives alongside<br />
   the more clinical legal one, giving context to<br />
   the issues at stake. As such, it is willing to<br />
   admit the facts, such as they are known to this<br />
   point, are clear a** yet necessarily complex, and<br />
   that unless the complexity is taken into account<br />
   it is impossible to understand the narrative a** or avert a further<br />
   disaster.<br />
<br />
   Boiled down to one sentence, the report says<br />
   Georgia attacked first, but upon a background of<br />
   lengthy provocation by Russia. Unsurprisingly,<br />
   Georgia has rejected the specific finding though<br />
   not the report in its entirety, Russia has<br />
   seemingly embraced the specific finding but not<br />
   the whole report, while international leaders<br />
   have remained eerily silent, and for good reason:<br />
   no one emerges well from these pages (barring<br />
   Nicolas Sarkozy, then head of the EU presidency,<br />
   whose persistent diplomacy is deemed to have brought about a ceasefire).<br />
<br />
   The US is correctly singled out for criticism for<br />
   building up Georgia's military capability without<br />
   a thought for the viability of this move or its<br />
   end result; Russia is justifiably criticised for<br />
   using its so-called ethnic nationals as a ruse to<br />
   enter and expand a presence in South Ossetia and<br />
   Abkhazia; Georgia is clearly criticised for being<br />
   provocative to a much bigger and powerful<br />
   neighbour without a thought for consequence; and<br />
   the international community at large is<br />
   criticised for doing too little in the face of an<br />
   obviously deteriorating situation that has wider<br />
   implications for the region and much further afield.<br />
<br />
   All these are bad enough, but the nub of the<br />
   report remains the essential international<br />
   stand-off regarding sovereignty and the<br />
   interpretation of international law a** which is<br />
   the real reason the international leadership is<br />
   flummoxed. It is made clear that these issues<br />
   served as part of the backdrop to the conflict,<br />
   that self-determination is not recognised in<br />
   international law as a basis for the unilateral<br />
   creation of a new state &quot;outside the colonial<br />
   context and apartheid&quot;, and that much of<br />
   international state practice &quot;and the explicit<br />
   views of major powers such as Russia in the<br />
   Kosovo case stand against it.&quot; Most crucially,<br />
   the report goes on to note that according to &quot;the<br />
   overwhelmingly accepted uti possidetis principle,<br />
   only former constituent republics such as Georgia<br />
   but not territorial sub-units such as South<br />
   Ossetia or Abkhazia are granted independence in<br />
   case of dismemberment of a larger entity such as the former Soviet Union.&quot;<br />
<br />
   One year ago I wrote here that:<br />
<br />
   &quot;[Kosovo] has become the nub of the Georgian<br />
   conflict a** which only underlines the need for a<br />
   far more fundamental debate [about international<br />
   law]. And while the west adamantly refutes any<br />
   comparison between the two, Russia is equally<br />
   adamant it has served as a precedent for its own actions.&quot;<br />
<br />
   The report clearly bears out this assessment, and<br />
   while it criticises Russia for recognising the<br />
   so-called independent republics of Abkhazia and<br />
   South Ossetia a** deemed unlawful by the report a**<br />
   it also effectively accepts Russia's position<br />
   that Kosovo's self-declared independence is<br />
   problematic within international law, not least<br />
   because it had been a province of the former<br />
   Yugoslavia, not a constituent republic.<br />
<br />
   This is an important development, underlined in<br />
   paragraph 8 of the report's &quot;Observations&quot;<br />
   section a** which is drafted in determinedly<br />
   ambiguous terms that reflect far beyond the events in the Caucusus:<br />
<br />
   &quot;The conflict in Georgia in summer 2008 laid open<br />
   tendencies by some of the political actors to<br />
   move away from generally-accepted principles of<br />
   international law such as the respect of<br />
   territorial integrity. There were also<br />
   ambiguities, if not infringements as related to<br />
   the principle of sovereignty. There has also been<br />
   a tendency to move away from multilateralism and<br />
   negotiated results and solutions in favour of unilateral action.&quot;<br />
<br />
   These are extremely strong words, aimed as much<br />
   at Washington and Brussels and all capitals in<br />
   the west as they are at Moscow and Tbilisi and<br />
   capitals east. They should be heeded.<br />
<br />
   Reviewing the report, David Hearst pointed out<br />
   last week that the Caucasus has to work out its<br />
   own relationships, possibly with western help but<br />
   without western interference. This is true, but<br />
   there is a need for a corollary: east and west,<br />
   north and south, Russia and Georgia a** we all need<br />
   to work on achieving an agreement on<br />
   international law and its application to states.<br />
   If not we are looking not only at a further<br />
   potential deterioration in the Caucusus, but also<br />
   at other possible conflicts over self-determination and sovereignty.<br />
<br />
    From Kurdistan to the Basque country, from<br />
   Transnistria to Chechnya, the world is full of<br />
   peoples who seek independent states: they deserve<br />
   to know the rules of the game. But beyond that,<br />
   we all need to know: are states to remain defined<br />
   by territorial integrity or has that now become a<br />
   pawn to be used cynically by one side or another<br />
   in an unfolding game of international one-upmanship?<br />
