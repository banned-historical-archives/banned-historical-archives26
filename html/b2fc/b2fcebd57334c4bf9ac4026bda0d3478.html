		<h3>Tor</h3>
		<p><a href="https://www.torproject.org">Tor</a> is an encrypted anonymising network that makes it harder to intercept internet communications, or see where communications are coming from or going to.</p>
		<p>In order to use the WikiLeaks public submission system as detailed above you can download the Tor Browser Bundle, which is a Firefox-like browser available for Windows, Mac OS X and GNU/Linux and pre-configured to connect using the anonymising system Tor.</p>
		<h4>Tails</h4>
		<p>If you are at high risk and you have the capacity to do so, you can also access the submission system through a secure operating system called <a href="https://tails.boum.org">Tails</a>. Tails is an operating system launched from a USB stick or a DVD that aim to leaves no traces when the computer is shut down after use and automatically routes your internet traffic through Tor. Tails will require you to have either a USB stick or a DVD at least 4GB big and a laptop or desktop computer.</p>

		<h3>Tips</h3>
		<p>Our submission system works hard to preserve your anonymity, but we recommend you also take some of your own precautions. Please review these basic guidelines. </p>
		<div>
			<h4>1. Contact us if you have specific problems</h4>
			<p>If you have a very large submission, or a submission with a complex format, or are a high-risk source, please <a href="#submit_help_contact">contact us</a>. In our experience it is always possible to find a custom solution for even the most seemingly difficult situations.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h4>2. What computer to use</h4>
			<p>If the computer you are uploading from could subsequently be audited in an investigation, consider using a computer that is not easily tied to you. Technical users can also use <a href="https://tails.boum.org">Tails</a> to help ensure you do not leave any records of your submission on the computer.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h4>3. Do not talk about your submission to others</h4>
			<p>If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in source protection – it is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This includes other media organisations.</p>
		</div>

	</div>

		<h3>After</h3>

		<div>
			<h4>1. Do not talk about your submission to others</h4>
			<p>If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in source protection – it is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This includes other media organisations.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h4>2. Act normal</h4>
			<p>If you are a high-risk source, avoid saying anything or doing anything after submitting which might promote suspicion. In particular, you should try to stick to your normal routine and behaviour.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h4>3. Remove traces of your submission</h4>
			<p>If you are a high-risk source and the computer you prepared your submission on, or uploaded it from, could subsequently be audited in an investigation, we recommend that you format and dispose of the computer hard drive and any other storage media you used.</p>
			<p>In particular, hard drives retain data after formatting which may be visible to a digital forensics team and flash media (USB sticks, memory cards and SSD drives) retain data even after a secure erasure. If you used flash media to store sensitive data, it is important to destroy the media.</p>
			<p>If you do this and are a high-risk source you should make sure there are no traces of the clean-up, since such traces themselves may draw suspicion.</p>
			<div>
				<h4>4. If you face legal action</h4>
				<p>If a legal action is brought against you as a result of your submission, there are organisations that may help you. The Courage Foundation is an international organisation dedicated to the protection of journalistic sources. You can find more details at <a href="https://www.couragefound.org">https://www.couragefound.org</a>.</p>

		<p>WikiLeaks publishes documents of political or historical importance that are censored or otherwise suppressed. We specialise in strategic global publishing and large archives.</p>
		<p>The following is the address of our secure site where you can anonymously upload your documents to WikiLeaks editors. You can only access this submissions system through Tor. (See our <a href="#submit_help_tor">Tor tab</a> for more information.) We also advise you to read our <a href="#submit_help_tips">tips for sources</a> before submitting.</p>

			<!--<div>
				Copy this address into your Tor browser. Advanced users, if they wish, can also add a further layer of encryption to their submission using <a href="#submit_wlkey">our public PGP key</a>.
			</div>-->
		</div>

		<p>If you cannot use Tor, or your submission is very large, or you have specific requirements, WikiLeaks provides several alternative methods. <a href="#submit_help_contact">Contact us</a> to discuss how to proceed.</p>

MEETING HELD FEBRUARY 3 BETWEEN AMBASSADOR WOLFF AND PRIME
MINISTER LEE KUAN YEW, SUPPLEMENTED BY NOTES PROVIDED BY AMBASSADOR WOLFF. PRIME MINISTER LEE WAS EXTREMELY FORTHCOMING
AND CANDID, AND CLEARLY EXPECTED THAT HIS REMARKS WOULD BE
TREATED AS SENSITIVE. SUBJECTS DISCUSSED INCLUDED A BROAD
SPECTRUM OF GLOBAL ISSUES AND WERE NOT RESTRICTED TO MTN
MATTERS. I BELIEVE PRIME MINISTER LEE WELCOMES DISCUSSIONS OF THIS
SORT, SINCE FEW IF ANY OF HIS ASSOCIATES IN SINGAPORE ARE AS
CONCERNED WITH GLOBAL MATTERS AS IS HE, AND HE ACCORDINGLY HAS
FEW OPPORTUNITIES TO EXPRESS HIS THOUGHTS ON IMPORTANT WORLD
(AS OPPOSED TO LOCAL OR REGIONAL) ISSUES EXCEPT WHEN WELL-INFORMED
VISITORS SUCH AS AMBASSADOR WOLFF PASS THROUGH SINGAPORE.

2. CONVERSATION BEGAN WITH REFERENCES TO UNEMPLOYMENT SITUATION
IN U.S. AND IN EUROPE, WITH AMBASSADOR WOLFF SAYING THAT WHILE
SITUATION HAD IMPROVED SOMEWHAT IN THE U.S. PROBLEMS STILL
EXISTED IN WESTERN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES. IN THE U.S., UNEMPLOYMENT WAS GREATEST AMONG YOUTH AND MINORITIES. PM LEE SAID THAT
THE PROBLEM, IN FACT, WAS PRIMARILY AMONG MINORITY YOUTH,
WHERE UNEMPLOYMENT RATES IN URBAN AREAS RUN AS HIGH AS 40

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
PERCENT. HE FELT PROBLEM COULD NOT BE SOLVED UNTIL EDUCATIONAL
OPPORTUNITIES WERE THE SAME FOR EVERYONE, WHICH WOULD TAKE
TIME--AS MUCH AS A GENERATION. PM LEE ALSO OBSERVED THAT HE
U.S. HAD ADDED 500,000 JOBS TO LABOR FORCE IN 1977 BUT THAT
THIS HAD ONLY CAUSED UNEMPLOYMENT RATE TO DROP BY A FEW
TENTHS OF A PERCENT. EVEN IF THE SAME NUMBER OF JOBS WAS ADDED
IN 1978, THE SITUATION WOULD NOT BE MUCH DIFFERENT.
AT THE SAME TIME, HOWEVER, THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE EMPLOYED
IN U.S. WAS HIGHEST IN ITS HISTORY.
3. PM LEE WENT ON TO SAY THAT AN ESSENTIAL INGREDIENT IN
BRINGING ABOUT IMPROVEMENT OF EMPLOYMENT SITUATION IN U.S.
IS AN EFFECTIVE ENERGY BILL, AND HE ASKED AMBASSADOR
WOLFF HOW SOON CONGRESS MIGHT ACT FAVORABLY IN THIS REGARD.
WHEN AMBASSADOR WOLFF SAID THE TIME FRAME MIGHT BE TWO TO THREE
MONTHS, PM LEE APPEARED SURPRISED AND NOTED HE HAD THOUGHT
PASSAGE OF ENERGY BILL MIGHT TAKE PLACE IN ABOUT SIX WEEKS.
AMBASSADOR WOLFF EXPLAINED THAT TIME FRAME HE HAD SUGGESTED
WAS AN OUTSIDE LIMIT. HE INDICATED AMBASSADOR STRAUSS WAS IN CHARGE
OF LEGISLATIVE STATEGY FOR PASSAGE OF ENERGY BILL, AND STATED
THAT AMBASSADOR STRAUSS WAS CONFIDENT THAT CONGRESS WOULD
ACT FAVORABLY. PM LEE SAID &quot;YOU TELL BOB STRAUSS TO GET A GOOD
ENERGY BILL.&quot; REDUCTION OF U.S. DEPENDENCE ON ENERGY IMPORTS
HAD TO BE A TOP U.S. PRIORITY. (IN PASSING, PM LEE REMARKED THAT
IF A MAJOR OPEC PRODUCER SUCH AS SAUDI ARABIA TRIED TO REDUCE
PRODUCTION IN THE EVENT U.S. ENERGY IMPORTS WERE REDUCED

SIGNIFICANTLY, THE RESULT WOULD BE THE &quot;COLLAPSE&quot; OF THE SAUDI
ARABIAN ROYAL FAMILY. HE DID NOT ELABORATE, BUT PERHAPS HE HAD
IN MIND THE REQUIREMENT NOW BORNE BY SAUDI ARABIA TO MAINTAIN
INTERNAL DEVELOPMENT AND AT THE SAME TIME SUBSIDIZE MODERATE
ARAB STATES, ALL ON A BASIS OF REVENUES EARNED FROM OIL.)
4. DISCUSSION TURNED TO THE SUBJECT OF PROTECTIONISM,
WITH PM LEE GIVING THE U.S., AND PARTICULARLY AMBASSADOR
STRAUSS, HIGH MARKS FOR STANDING IN THE FOREFRONT AGAINST
PROTECTIONIST TRANDS AT HOME AND ABROAD. HE WAS RATHER
PESSIMISTIC ABOUT THE TREND TOWARD PROTECTIONISM WITHIN THE
EEC NATIONS, SINGLING OUT IN PARTICULAR THE U.K., WHICH HAD
AT ONE TIME ADVOCATED FREE TRADE BUT NOW APPARENTLY DECIDED
NOT ONLY TO GO ALONG WITH EEC PROTECTIONISM BUT TO ASK FOR MORE.
ALL THE U.K. LABOR UNIONS WANTED WAS TO RECEIVE AND NOT TO GIVE.
JIM CALLAGHAN WAS DOING AN OUTSTANDING JOB IN HOLDING THE COUNTRY
TOGETHER, BUT WAS UNABLE TO ACCOMPLISH ANYTHING MORE THAN MAINTAIN UNITY, AND ECONOMIC PRODUCTION WAS NOT INCREASING. PM
LEE EXPRESSED REGRET THAT THE U.K. HAD NOT BEEN ABLE TO ENTER
THE EEC IN 1963, WHEN IT WAS AT THE HEIGHT OF ITS POSTWAR CONFIDENCE, BUT CAME IN ONLY AFTER ITS CONFIDENCE HAD BEEN DESTROYED. HE CRITICIZED GENERAL DE GAULLE IN THIS REGARD,

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
SAYING THAT IT WAS DE GAULLE'S VINDICTIVENESS AGAINST THE U.K.
WHICH HAD HELPED TO BRING ABOUT ITS PRESENT SITUATION. GENERAL
DE GAULLE, PM LEE SAID, WAS IN MANY RESPECTS A VERY GOOD MAN,
BUT HE WAS ALSO A VERY EVIL MAN IN THE WAY HE HAD HARBORED A
GRUDGE AGAINST THE U.K.
5. ON THE SUBJECT OF U.S.-JAPANESE TRADE TALKS, PM LEE STATED
THAT HE WAS HOPEFUL BUT WONDERED IF RESULTS OF THE U.S.JAPANESE DISCUSSIONS AND THE JOINT COMMUNIQUE ISSUED IN TOKYO
BY AMBASSADORS USHIBA AND STRAUSS REALLY WERE AS SATISFACTORY TO
THE U.S. AS AMBASSADOR STRAUSS HAD SAID IN HIS PRESS CONFERENCE.
AMBASSADOR WOLFF AGREED THAT THE REALITY WAS SOMETHING LESS THAN
WE HAD DESIRED, BUT OBSERVED THAT AMBASSADOR STRUSS HAD FELT
IT NECESSARY TO GET THE JAPANESE MOVING AND TO DRAW THEM ALONG.

THEY WOULD PROBABLY NOT SUCCEED IN REACHING 7 PERCENT INCREASE
IN GNP THIS YEAR, AND THE TARIFF REDUCTIONS THEY HAD ANNOUNCED
WERE STILL FAIRLY MINOR; NEVERTHELESS THEY NOW SAW THE NECESSITY
OF MAKING ADJUSTMENTS ON TRADE AND TARIFFS TO MEET THE NEEDS
OF THE U.S. AND OTHER COUNTRIES. AMBASSADOR WOLFF
RECALLED THAT WHEN USHIBA HAD BEEN IN WASHINGTON HE HAD ENCOUNTERED AN IDENTICAL POINT OF VIEW ON THE PART
OF EVERYONE HE HAD TALKED WITH, AND HAD CARRIED THIS WORD
BACK TO TOKYO; FUKUDA HAD THEN ON HIS OWN SET A 7 PERCENT
TARGET FOR GROWTIH IN THE DOMESTIC ECONOMY. WE HAD HEARD
THAT IMPORTANT ELEMENTS IN JAPAN HAD WANTED TO HOLD THE GROWTH
RATE TO 6 PERCENT, WHILE SOME PEOPLE IN THE U.S. WOULD HAVE
FAVORED AN 8 PERCENT GROWTH RATE.

6. AMBASSADOR WOLFF THEN OUTLINED THE U.S. POSITION ON THE NEED
TO REACH AN MTN AGREEMENT IN THE CURRENT TOKYO ROUND BY NEXT
JULY, OR AT LEAST TO BE FAR ENOUGH ALONG TOWARD ONE WHEN CONGRESS
ADJOURNED SO THAT CONGRESSMEN RUNNING FOR ELECTION COULD HAVE
SOMETHING TANGIBLE TO SAY TO THEIR CONSTITUENTS AS TO HOW AN
MTN AGREMENT WOULD SERVE LOCAL INTERESTS. WE HAD BEEN
TALKING ABOUT AN MTN FOR YEARS WITH NO RESULTS AND UNLESS SOMETHING WUS ACHIEVED NOW, DOMESTIC PROTECTIONIST SENTIMENT
WOULD BE EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO OVERCOME. AMBASSADOR WOLFF NOTED
THAT ALTHOUGH GSP WOULD REMAIN IN EFFECT UNTIL 1984, IT WAS
UNILATERAL AND HENCE COULD BE WITHDRAWN AT ANY TIME; ON THE
OTHER HAND, AN MTN AGREEMENT WHICH CONTAINED SOME DEGREE OF
RECIPROCITY WOULD, IF WITHDRAWN, REQUIRE US TO GIVE SOMETHING
UP AND ACCORDINGLY HAD A GREATER DEGREE OF PERMANENCE. WE WERE
NOT ASKING FOR FULL RECIPROCITY, BUT BELIEVED IT WAS IMPORTANT
FOR ALL COUNTRIES, INCLUDING THE LDCS, TO EFFECT TARIFF REDUCTIONS WHERE THEY COULD AFFORD IT. AMBASSADOR WOLFF STRESSED
AGAIN THE URGENT NEED TO REACH AN AGREEMENT THIS YEAR.
7. WITH REGARD TO RECIPROCITY, PM LEE ASKED IF THERE
WERE ANY COUNTRIES AMONG THE LDCS WHICH MIGHT BE COUNTED
ON TO GO ALONG. AMBASSADOR WOLFF MENTIONED MEXICO, AND ALSO
POSSIBLY INDIA AND BRAZIL. PM LEE SAID THAT INDIAN POTENTIAL
FOR LEADERSHIP AMONG THE LDCS ON THIS AND OTHER MATTERS HAD
PERHAPS BEEN UNDERESTIMATED, AND THOUGHT THAT MEXICO WITHOUT

ECHEVERRIA MIGHT ALSO BE HELPFUL ON ECONOMIC ISSUES. HE DISCOUNTED
THE ROLE OF BRAZIL, HOWEVER, ON GROUNDS THAT THE BRAZILIAN
GENERALS BELIEVED CRITICISM OF THEIR DICTATORSHIP WOULD BE MADE
MORE DIFFICULT IF THEY ADHERED TO THE STRAIGHT LDC LINE.
HE SUGGESTED THAT WE WERE THEREFORE OVERESTIMATING BRAZILIAN
FLEXIBILITY AND WILLINGNESS TO ASSERT LEADERSHIP. (NOTE:
SINGAPORE ITSELF IS CONSIDERING OFFERING RECIPROCITY TO THE U.S.
IN TARIFF CUTS ON A NUMBER OF ITEMS IF AGREEMENT CAN BE REACHED
ON U.S. CONSIDERATION OF EXPORT ITEMS OF INTEREST IN SINGAPORE.)
8. AMBASSADOR WOLFF WENT ON TO OUTLINE THE U.S. VIEW THAT THE LDCS
SHOULD TAKE A MORE POSITIVE PART IN THE MTN NEGOTIATIONS. THEIR
POSITION APPEARED TO BE THAT THE LDCS SHOULD WAIT UNTIL THE BASIC
MTN NEGOTIATIONS WERE COMPLETED, AND THEN ASK FOR
PREFERENTIAL TREATMENT, BUT WE FELT THAT IT WAS IMPERATIVE FOR
THEM TO HELP REACH A BASIC AGREEMENT. ALTHOUGH MANY OF THE LDCS
SAID THEY AGREED WITH US IN PRIVATE, THEY NEVERTHELESS
TOOK A PUBLIC POSITION WHICH WAS NOT HELPFUL. AMBASSADOR WOLFF
ADDED THAT THIS LDC STANCE GAVE ENCOURAGEMENT TO THOSE IN
THE U.S., JAPAN, AND EEC WHO FAVORED REACHING AN MTN AGREEMENT

AMONG THESE COUNTRIES AND FORGETTING ABOUT THE LDCS.
9. PM LEE DECLARED THAT HE WAS WHOLLY IN ACCORD. HE
HAD NO USE FOR THE G-77 LINE, WHICH CALLED FOR THE DEVELOPED
COUNTRIES TO MAKE ALL THE CONCESSIONS WITHOUT ANY OBLIGATION
ON THE PART OF THE LDCS. ALL THAT SUCH COUNTRIES WERE DOING
WAS EXTENDING A BEGGING BOWL AND SAYING &quot;GIVE.&quot; SINGAPORE
BELIEVED IN THE FREE ENTERPRISE SYSTEM AND IN OVENING ITS MARKET
TO THE DEVELOPED COUNTRIES, WHILE AT THE SAME TIME EXPORTING
ITS OWN PRODUCTS IN RETURN. IN FACT, SINGAPORE ITSELF REPRESENTED THE NEW INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC ORDER, DEVELOPMENT THROUGH
TRADE AND INVESTMENT, AND MOST OF THE G-77 KNEW THAT WHAT
THEY WERE TALING ABOUT WAS BUNK. PM LEE REITERATED A POINT

PAGE 03

SINGAP 00641 02 OF 04 110716Z

WHICH HE HAS MADE PREVIOUSLY ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS: &quot;WE'RE PLUGGED
INTO YOUR GRID.&quot;
10. PM LEE EXPRESSED THE OPINION THAT THE U.S. ITSELF WAS PARTLY
TO BLAME FOR THE LDC ATTITUDE. LACK OF A FIRM STAND ON OUR
PART HAD ALLOWED THE LDCS TO MAINTAIN AN UNNATURAL SOLIDARITY.
HE HAD DISCUSSED THIS WITH DICK COOPER, AND COOPER HAD AGREED.
FOR EXAMPLE, IN RESPONSE TO THE LDC CALL FOR THE CAPITAL C,
CAPITAL F, &quot;COMMON FUND,&quot; WE HAD SAID WE WOULD SUPPORT A
&quot;COMMON FUND&quot; SMALL C, SMALL F. ALTHOUGH THE U.S. HAD SAID
THAT THE TERMS OF THIS LATTER COMMON FUND HAD YET TO BE WORKED
OUT, THE HARDLINERS AMONG THE G-77 HAD PICKED UP THE U.S.
POSITION AND WERE NOW SAYING WE SUPPORTED THE FORMER. IN SINGAPORE'S
CONVERSATIONS WITH VARIOUS LDCS IT HAD BEEN AMPLY
CLEAR THAT THEY UNDERSTOOD THE ISSUES INVOLVED, BUT WHEN THE
TIME CAME FOR THEM TO SPEAK UP PUBLICLY THEY FELL INTO LINE AND
FOLLOWED THE LEADERSHIP OF THE MORE RADICAL ELEMENTS REGARDLESS
OF THE FACT THAT THEY KNEW THEIR OWN INTERESTS WERE BEING COMPROMISED. PM LEE SAID IT WAS UP TO THE U.S. AND OTHER DEVELOPED
COUNTRIES NOT TO GIVE IN, BUT TO TAKE A FIRM POSITION ON ISSUES
INVOLVING TRADE AND DEVELOPMENT. THE MORE MODERATE LDCS
(INCLUDING BOTH OPEC AND NON-OPEC COUNTRIES) WOULD THEN BE MORE
LIKELY TO BREAK WITH THE LINE ESPOUSED BY THE RADICAL G-77 STATES.
11. PM LEE STATED THAT THE CLIMATE OF OPINION HE HAD DESCRIBED
EXTENDED EVEN TO THE COMMONWEALTH SECRETARIAT IN LONDON
WHERE, INCREDIBLY, THEY WANTED THE LDCS TO GIVE UP MTN.
HE CALLED TO HIS SECRETARY TO BRING A PAPER PRODUCED BY THE
COMMONWEALTH SECRETARIAT FOR DISCUSSION AT THE FORTHCOMING
COMMONWEALTH REGIONAL HEADS OF GOVERNMENT MEETING IN SYDNEY,
AND SHOWED A SECTION WHICH DECLARED THAT THE INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC ORDER ESTABLISHED IN 1944 HAD WORKED TO THE BENEFIT OF
THE DEVELOPED COUNTRIES RATHER THAN THE LDCS, AND THAT THE
LDCS SHOULD ACCORDINGLY REJECT THIS ORDER AND ITS EXISTING
PATTERNS OF TRADE BETWEEN LDCS AND DEVELOPED COUNTRIES

SUCH A SITUATION, THE PAPER SAID, IT MIGHT BE NECESSARY
FOR THE &quot;MORE DEVELOPED&quot; LDCS TO MAKE CONCESSIONS TO THE
OTHERS. PM LEE WONDERED RHETORICALLY WHO THESE MORE DEVELOPED
LDCS WERE, AND COMMENTED THAT HE ASSUMED IT MEANT SINGAPORE
AMONG OTHERS. HE TERMED THIS PAPER &quot;NONSENSE.&quot;
AUSTRALIAN PRIME MINISTER FRASER HAD ASKED HIM TO OPEN THE MEETING
IN SYDNEY BY SPEAKING TO IT, AND HE WOULD DO SO BY KNOCKING IT
DOWN.
12. AMBASSADOR WOLFF SAID IN REFERENCE TO THE TOKYO ROUND IN
GENEVA THAT WE WOULD LIKE PM LEE'S HELP. WHEN PM LEE ASKED
&quot;IN WHAT WAY?&quot; AMBASSADOR WOLFF REPLIED&quot; BY EXPRESSING PUBLICLY
IN MEETINGS SUCH AS THE GATT THE POSITION YOU TAKE IN PRIVATE.&quot;
PM LEE SAID THAT SINGAPORE HAD DELIBERATELY ADOPTED A
POLICY IN THE GATT TO &quot;LAY LOW.&quot; HE WOULD LIKE TO HELP; HOWEVER,
IF SINGAPORE SPOKE UP PUBLICLY &quot;WE'LL BE LYNCHED.&quot; HE WENT
ON TO SAY THAT SINGAPORE WAS ALREADY REGARDED WITH SUSPICION BY THE RADICAL LEADERSHIP OF THE G-77 STATES, WHO KNEW
WHERE HE, LEE, REALLY STOOD. HE HAD MADE THIS PLAIN WHEN
HE HAD REFUSED TO ATTEND THE NONALIGNED SUMMIT MEETING IN COLOMBO
BUT HAD HIS SPEECH READ, INSTEAD. HE HAD USED THE WORLD &quot;LYNCHED&quot;
BECAUSE THIS WAS PRECISELY WHAT HE HAD BEEN TOLD BY HIS U.N.
AMBASSADOR, A &quot;QUITE GOOD MAN,&quot; IN THE EVENT THAT SINGAPORE TOOK
A POSITION CONTRARY TO THAT OF THE OTHER G-77 LDC GROUP. WHAT
SINGAPORE FEARED WAS TO BE ISOLATED; THAT IS, TO BE ATTACKED
BY OTHER LDCS AS A COUNTRY WHICH WAS NO LONGER DEVELOPING BUT
WHICH WAS DEVELOPED, AND THUS LOOSE THE BENEFITS IT NOW ENJOYED
IN ITS CURRENT LDC STATUS.

13. PM LEE EXPLAINED THE HISTORY OF SINGAPORE SINCE IT HAD BEEN
EXPELLED FROM MALAYSIA IN 1965 AND HOW IT HAD REACHED ITS
PRESENT STATUS BOTH BY HARD WORK AND BY BENEFITING FROM ITS
EXPORTS TO MARKETS WHERE IT HAD RECEIVED
PREFERENCES, THANKS TO ITS BEING AN LDC. HE ALSO OUTLINED
THE THREATS TO ITS LDC STATUS WHICH IT HAD ALREADY ENCOUNTERED
RECENTLY, INCLUDING LOSS OF OPIC COVERAGE, AND ITS CLASSIFICATION
AS A DEVELOPED COUNTRY WITH RESPECT TO IMF GOLD SALES. IN SHIS
LATTER REGARD HE NOTED THAT THE IMF MOVE WAS A POLITICAL ONE
DESIGNED TO ASSURE CONTINUED ARAB CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE IMF:
IN ORDER TO REMOVE ISRAEL FROM THE DEVELOPING CATEGORY, A NUMBER
OF OTHER COUNTRIES HAD TO BE SIMILARLY TREATED, AND SINGAPORE
WAS ONE ALONG WITH PORTUGAL AND GREECE.
14. PM LEE ALSO OUTLINED THE PROBLEMS WHICH WOULD BE
CREATED FOR SINGAPORE BY WITHDRAWAL OF TAX DEFERRAL ON FOREIGN
U.S. INVESTMENTS AND REDUCTION OF TAX DECUCTIONS GRANTED
U.S. BUSINESSMEN UNDER SECTION 911. HE STRESSED THAT SINGAPORE
WAS NOT IN REALITY A DEVELOPED COUNTRY. IF THE 30,000 OR SO
EXPATRIATES IN SINGAPORE WHO MADE UP MUCH OF ITS MANAGERIAL AND
ENTREPRENEURIAL CLASS WERE REMOVED FROM THE PICTURE, SINGAPORE'S
PER CAPITA GNP WOULD BE REDUCED FROM ITS PRESENT LEVEL OF
US$2,500 PER ANNUN TO AROUND US$1,000 PER ANNUM, WHICH WOULD
BE A MUCH FAIRER PICTURE OF WHERE SINGAPORE STOOD IN ITS DEVELOPMENT. IN FACT, SINGAPORE WAS PREPARING A STUDY ON THIS

SUBJECT FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE IMF AND OTHERS WHICH WOULD PROVIDE
SOME SURPRISES. IT WOULD BE AT LEAST 10 OR 15 YEARS BEFORE
SINGAPORE WOULD REALLY REACH DEVELOPED STATUS, PROVIDED NO WAR
OR DEPRESSION OR OTHER CATACLYSM INTERFERED.
15. PM LEE THEN SAID &quot;WE'LL HELP YOU.&quot; DESPITE THE POSSIBILITY
THAT SINGAPORE MIGHT BE ISOLATED FROM THE G77, LDC GROUP,
SINGAPORE WOULD BE WILLING TO DO WHAT IT COULD IN SUPPORT OF AN
MTN. HOWEVER, TO COMPENSAGE FOR POSSIBLE DIFFICULTIES ARISING
AS A RESULT OF G77, LDC CRITICISM, HE HOPED THE U.S. WOULD
BE HELPFUL FOR ITS PART WITH RESPECT TO SUCH ISSUES AS TAX
DEFERRAL, AND OTHER INCENTIVES TO U.S. INVESTMENT IN SINGAPORE.
HE ALSO HOPED THAT THE U.S. WOULD CONTINUE GRANTING GSP TO
SINGAPORE. HE STRESSED AGAIN THAT SINGAPORE WAS NOT A DEVELOPED
COUNTRY, NOR SHOULD IT BE CONSIDERED ONE UNTIL PER CAPITAL INCOME
OF THE NON-EXPATRIATE ELEMENT OF SINGAPORE'S POPULATION REACHED,
SAY, US$4,000, IN AROUND 10 YEARS' TIME. THE U.S. SHOULD TELL HIM
WHAT TO DO TO BE HELPFUL AND HE WOULD DO IT (HOPEFULLY NOT TO

SUGGESTED THAT THE U.S. AMBASSADOR BE USED AS A CHANNEL THROUGH
WHICH FURTHER COMMUNICATIONS COULD BE HANDLED ON THIS SUBJECT,
AND AMBASSADOR WOLFF PROMISED TO SEND HIM U.S. VIEWS ON WHAT
PM LEE MIGHT DO THROUGH THE AMBASSADOR.
16. PM LEE ALSO PROMISED TO SEND A STRONG SPOKESMAN TO
GENEVA WHO UNDERSTOOD HIS VIEWS AND COULD PRESENT THEM, ONCE
HE KNEW WHAT WAS NEEDED.THIS INDIVIDUAL MIGHT NOT BE ON
A PERMANENT BASIS SINCE SINGAPORE'S RESOURCES OF QUALIFIED PERSONNEL WERE LIMITED, BUT WOULD BE SENT FOR THE PERIOD REQUIRED.
LOOKING TO THE FUTURE OF THE WORLD ECONOMIC SYSTEM,
HE CONCURRED WITH AMBASSADOR WOLFF THAT IT WAS THE SHAPE OF
THE SYSTEM AND NOT SPECIAL AND DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT THAT MATTERED
MOST.

17. AMBASSADOR WOLFF AND PM LEE TOUCHED ON THE SUBJECT OF THE GROSS
IMBALANCE IN THE WORLD BALANCES OF PAYMENTS DUE TO THE HUGH
SURPLUS EARNED BY THE OPEC COUNTRIES. PM LEE SUGGESTED THAT
THE OPEC COUNTRIES SHOULD CARRY THE COST OF DEVELOPMENT FOR
OTHER LDCS THROUGH ANY INSTITUTION THEY CARED TO USE: WORLD
BANK, REGIONAL BANKS OR THE ARAB BANK (WHICH HE MAINTAINED DID
NOTHING SIGNIFICANT TO HELP NON-ARAB LDCS.) HE OFFERED AN
ADDITIONAL THOUGHT:TO PICK UP AN IDEA WHICH HAD BEEN PUT FORWARD
PRIVATELY SOME YEARS EARLIER BY THE SHAH OR IRAN TO ESTABLISH
SOME SORT OF REGIONAL GROUPING AMONG MODERATE LDCS TO INCLUDE
IRAN, PAKISTAN, THE NON-COMMUNIST SOUTHEAST ASIAN NATIONS,
AND PERHAPS INDIA. THIS CONCEPT HAD APPARENTLY FALLEN BY THE
WAYWIDE WITH BHUTTO'S REMOVAL FROM POLITICAL POWER, BUT
MIGHT STILL HAVE SOME POTENTIALITIES. PM LEE EXPRESSED ADMIRATION FOR THE SHAH AS A MAN POSSESSING CONSIDERABLE VISION
AND AN AWARENESS OF WORLD REALITIES.
18. APROPOS OF OPEC, PM LEE REMARKED THAT ITS SUCCESS HAD
GIVEN RISE TO EFFORTS AMONG PRODUCERS OF OTHER COMMODITIES TO
SET UP SIMILAR GROUPINGS TO KEEP UP THE PRICE OF THEIR PARTICULAR RAW MATERIALS. HOWEVER, HE SAW LITTLE LIKELIHOOD THAT SUCH CARTELS WOULD BE SUCCESSFUL.
19. AMBASSADOR WOLFF ASKED PM LEE IF HE HAD FELT ANY APPREHENSIONS
ABLUT U.S. POLICY IN THE REGION WITH THE ADVENT OF
THE NEW ADMINISTRATION. PM LEE REPLIED THAT THE U.S. TROOP
REDUCTION IN KOREA HAD INDEED GIVEN RISE TO APPREHENSIONS AS
IT SUGGESTED A DIMINISHED INTEREST IN THE REGION.
HE MENTIONED THERE HAD SUBSEQUENTLY BEEN NUMEROUS STATEMENTS FROM
SENIOR U.S. OFFICIALS THAT THE U.S. INTENDED TO REMAIN A FORCE
IN THE REGION, AND HE INDICATED IN THE CONTEXT OF HIS REMARKS
THAT HE HAD ACCEPTED THESE STATEMENTS. HOWEVER, THE MOST EFFEC-

20. IN A FURTHER COMMENT ON U.S. POLICY, PM LEE REFERRED TO
HIS OWN STUDY OF MAO TSE-TUNG, A NECESSITY TO HIM BECAUSE HIS
OPPONENTS ALSO STUDIED MAO, AND STRESSED THAT ONE KEY LESSON
HE HAD LEARNED FROM HIS READNS WAS NOT TO FIGHT MORE THAN
ONE ENEMY AT A TIME. THIS WAS THE IMPORT OF MAO'S THESIS ON
DIFFERENTIATING BETWEEN ONE'S ENEMIES AND ONE'S FRIEDS.
21. DIGRESSING FROM WHAT HE APPARENTLY INTENDED TO BE A
REFERENCE TO THE MANY ISSUES THE ADMINISTRATION IS NOW
CONFRONTING, PM LEE THEN SPOKE OF THE PERSONAL LESSON HE HAD
LEARNED FROM STUDYING MAO, WHO HAD FIRST JOINED WITH KUOMINTANG
AGAINST THE JAPANESE AND THEN TURNED AGAINST THE KUOMINTANG
WITH THE SUPPORT OF THE SO-CALLED NATIONAL BOURGEOISIE AFTER
THE JAPANESE DEFEAT. MAO FINALLY TURNED AGAINST THE
NATIONAL BOURGEOISIE. IN SINGAPORE, LEE HIMSELF HAD JOINED WITH
THE COMMUNISTS AGAINST THE BRITISH BECAUSE THE COMMUNISTS WERE
WILLING TO FIGHT, BUT AFTER THE BRITISH DEPARTED HE HAD LOOKED
AROUND TO SEE WHO THE COMMUNISTS' NEXT OPPONENT MIGHT BE AND
SUDDENTLY DISCOVERED HE WAS IT. KNOWING THAT HE COMMUNISTS
WOULD TRY TO DESTROY HIM, HE RESOLVED TO MOVE FIRST. FORTUNATELY,
THE COMMUNISTS MADE SOME MISTAKES WHICH PUT THEM ON THE OTHER

THE SUPERPOWERS. PM LEE AGREED, BUT FELT IT HAD SOME APPLICATION
TO RELATIONS BETWEEN THE DEVELOPED POWERS AND THE LDCS.
22. IN CONCLUSION, PM LEE SAID AGAIN THAT HE WOULD BE WILLING
TO HELP OUT WITH RESPECT TO THE MTN IF WE TOLD HIM WHAT HE SHOULD
DO. AS WE WERE ALL WALKING TOWARD THE DOOR, HE SAID
THAT HE WAS AT A LOSS TO UNDERSTAND WHY THE G77, LDC GROUP
TOOK SUCH EXTREME POSITIONS, AND COULD ONLY CONCLUDE THAT THE
RADICAL STATES HOPED THAT THROUGH THEIR LEADERSHIP OF THIS GROUP
THEY COULE EVENTUALLY BREAKUP THE ENTIRE WORLD ECONOMIC
ORDER.

1. FOLLOWING IS MY RECOLLECTION OF HIGHLIGHTS OF TWO-HOUR
MEETING HELD FEBRUARY 3 BETWEEN AMBASSADOR WOLFF AND PRIME
MINISTER LEE KUAN YEW, SUPPLEMENTED BY NOTES PROVIDED BY AMBASSADOR WOLFF. PRIME MINISTER LEE WAS EXTREMELY FORTHCOMING
AND CANDID, AND CLEARLY EXPECTED THAT HIS REMARKS WOULD BE
TREATED AS SENSITIVE. SUBJECTS DISCUSSED INCLUDED A BROAD
SPECTRUM OF GLOBAL ISSUES AND WERE NOT RESTRICTED TO MTN
MATTERS. I BELIEVE PRIME MINISTER LEE WELCOMES DISCUSSIONS OF THIS
SORT, SINCE FEW IF ANY OF HIS ASSOCIATES IN SINGAPORE ARE AS
CONCERNED WITH GLOBAL MATTERS AS IS HE, AND HE ACCORDINGLY HAS
FEW OPPORTUNITIES TO EXPRESS HIS THOUGHTS ON IMPORTANT WORLD
(AS OPPOSED TO LOCAL OR REGIONAL) ISSUES EXCEPT WHEN WELL-INFORMED
VISITORS SUCH AS AMBASSADOR WOLFF PASS THROUGH SINGAPORE.

2. CONVERSATION BEGAN WITH REFERENCES TO UNEMPLOYMENT SITUATION
IN U.S. AND IN EUROPE, WITH AMBASSADOR WOLFF SAYING THAT WHILE
SITUATION HAD IMPROVED SOMEWHAT IN THE U.S. PROBLEMS STILL
EXISTED IN WESTERN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES. IN THE U.S., UNEMPLOYMENT WAS GREATEST AMONG YOUTH AND MINORITIES. PM LEE SAID THAT
THE PROBLEM, IN FACT, WAS PRIMARILY AMONG MINORITY YOUTH,
WHERE UNEMPLOYMENT RATES IN URBAN AREAS RUN AS HIGH AS 40

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
PERCENT. HE FELT PROBLEM COULD NOT BE SOLVED UNTIL EDUCATIONAL
OPPORTUNITIES WERE THE SAME FOR EVERYONE, WHICH WOULD TAKE
TIME--AS MUCH AS A GENERATION. PM LEE ALSO OBSERVED THAT HE
U.S. HAD ADDED 500,000 JOBS TO LABOR FORCE IN 1977 BUT THAT
THIS HAD ONLY CAUSED UNEMPLOYMENT RATE TO DROP BY A FEW
TENTHS OF A PERCENT. EVEN IF THE SAME NUMBER OF JOBS WAS ADDED
IN 1978, THE SITUATION WOULD NOT BE MUCH DIFFERENT.
AT THE SAME TIME, HOWEVER, THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE EMPLOYED
IN U.S. WAS HIGHEST IN ITS HISTORY.
3. PM LEE WENT ON TO SAY THAT AN ESSENTIAL INGREDIENT IN
BRINGING ABOUT IMPROVEMENT OF EMPLOYMENT SITUATION IN U.S.
IS AN EFFECTIVE ENERGY BILL, AND HE ASKED AMBASSADOR
WOLFF HOW SOON CONGRESS MIGHT ACT FAVORABLY IN THIS REGARD.
WHEN AMBASSADOR WOLFF SAID THE TIME FRAME MIGHT BE TWO TO THREE
MONTHS, PM LEE APPEARED SURPRISED AND NOTED HE HAD THOUGHT
PASSAGE OF ENERGY BILL MIGHT TAKE PLACE IN ABOUT SIX WEEKS.
AMBASSADOR WOLFF EXPLAINED THAT TIME FRAME HE HAD SUGGESTED
WAS AN OUTSIDE LIMIT. HE INDICATED AMBASSADOR STRAUSS WAS IN CHARGE
OF LEGISLATIVE STATEGY FOR PASSAGE OF ENERGY BILL, AND STATED
THAT AMBASSADOR STRAUSS WAS CONFIDENT THAT CONGRESS WOULD
ACT FAVORABLY. PM LEE SAID &quot;YOU TELL BOB STRAUSS TO GET A GOOD
ENERGY BILL.&quot; REDUCTION OF U.S. DEPENDENCE ON ENERGY IMPORTS
HAD TO BE A TOP U.S. PRIORITY. (IN PASSING, PM LEE REMARKED THAT
IF A MAJOR OPEC PRODUCER SUCH AS SAUDI ARABIA TRIED TO REDUCE
PRODUCTION IN THE EVENT U.S. ENERGY IMPORTS WERE REDUCED
SECRET
SECRET
PAGE 03

SINGAP 00641 01 OF 04 110619Z

SIGNIFICANTLY, THE RESULT WOULD BE THE &quot;COLLAPSE&quot; OF THE SAUDI
ARABIAN ROYAL FAMILY. HE DID NOT ELABORATE, BUT PERHAPS HE HAD
IN MIND THE REQUIREMENT NOW BORNE BY SAUDI ARABIA TO MAINTAIN
INTERNAL DEVELOPMENT AND AT THE SAME TIME SUBSIDIZE MODERATE
ARAB STATES, ALL ON A BASIS OF REVENUES EARNED FROM OIL.)
4. DISCUSSION TURNED TO THE SUBJECT OF PROTECTIONISM,
WITH PM LEE GIVING THE U.S., AND PARTICULARLY AMBASSADOR
STRAUSS, HIGH MARKS FOR STANDING IN THE FOREFRONT AGAINST
PROTECTIONIST TRANDS AT HOME AND ABROAD. HE WAS RATHER
PESSIMISTIC ABOUT THE TREND TOWARD PROTECTIONISM WITHIN THE
EEC NATIONS, SINGLING OUT IN PARTICULAR THE U.K., WHICH HAD
AT ONE TIME ADVOCATED FREE TRADE BUT NOW APPARENTLY DECIDED
NOT ONLY TO GO ALONG WITH EEC PROTECTIONISM BUT TO ASK FOR MORE.
ALL THE U.K. LABOR UNIONS WANTED WAS TO RECEIVE AND NOT TO GIVE.
JIM CALLAGHAN WAS DOING AN OUTSTANDING JOB IN HOLDING THE COUNTRY
TOGETHER, BUT WAS UNABLE TO ACCOMPLISH ANYTHING MORE THAN MAINTAIN UNITY, AND ECONOMIC PRODUCTION WAS NOT INCREASING. PM
LEE EXPRESSED REGRET THAT THE U.K. HAD NOT BEEN ABLE TO ENTER
THE EEC IN 1963, WHEN IT WAS AT THE HEIGHT OF ITS POSTWAR CONFIDENCE, BUT CAME IN ONLY AFTER ITS CONFIDENCE HAD BEEN DESTROYED. HE CRITICIZED GENERAL DE GAULLE IN THIS REGARD,

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
SAYING THAT IT WAS DE GAULLE'S VINDICTIVENESS AGAINST THE U.K.
WHICH HAD HELPED TO BRING ABOUT ITS PRESENT SITUATION. GENERAL
DE GAULLE, PM LEE SAID, WAS IN MANY RESPECTS A VERY GOOD MAN,
BUT HE WAS ALSO A VERY EVIL MAN IN THE WAY HE HAD HARBORED A
GRUDGE AGAINST THE U.K.
5. ON THE SUBJECT OF U.S.-JAPANESE TRADE TALKS, PM LEE STATED
THAT HE WAS HOPEFUL BUT WONDERED IF RESULTS OF THE U.S.JAPANESE DISCUSSIONS AND THE JOINT COMMUNIQUE ISSUED IN TOKYO
BY AMBASSADORS USHIBA AND STRAUSS REALLY WERE AS SATISFACTORY TO
THE U.S. AS AMBASSADOR STRAUSS HAD SAID IN HIS PRESS CONFERENCE.
AMBASSADOR WOLFF AGREED THAT THE REALITY WAS SOMETHING LESS THAN
WE HAD DESIRED, BUT OBSERVED THAT AMBASSADOR STRUSS HAD FELT
IT NECESSARY TO GET THE JAPANESE MOVING AND TO DRAW THEM ALONG.
SECRET

THEY WOULD PROBABLY NOT SUCCEED IN REACHING 7 PERCENT INCREASE
IN GNP THIS YEAR, AND THE TARIFF REDUCTIONS THEY HAD ANNOUNCED
WERE STILL FAIRLY MINOR; NEVERTHELESS THEY NOW SAW THE NECESSITY
OF MAKING ADJUSTMENTS ON TRADE AND TARIFFS TO MEET THE NEEDS
OF THE U.S. AND OTHER COUNTRIES. AMBASSADOR WOLFF
RECALLED THAT WHEN USHIBA HAD BEEN IN WASHINGTON HE HAD ENCOUNTERED AN IDENTICAL POINT OF VIEW ON THE PART
OF EVERYONE HE HAD TALKED WITH, AND HAD CARRIED THIS WORD
BACK TO TOKYO; FUKUDA HAD THEN ON HIS OWN SET A 7 PERCENT
TARGET FOR GROWTIH IN THE DOMESTIC ECONOMY. WE HAD HEARD
THAT IMPORTANT ELEMENTS IN JAPAN HAD WANTED TO HOLD THE GROWTH
RATE TO 6 PERCENT, WHILE SOME PEOPLE IN THE U.S. WOULD HAVE
FAVORED AN 8 PERCENT GROWTH RATE.

6. AMBASSADOR WOLFF THEN OUTLINED THE U.S. POSITION ON THE NEED
TO REACH AN MTN AGREEMENT IN THE CURRENT TOKYO ROUND BY NEXT
JULY, OR AT LEAST TO BE FAR ENOUGH ALONG TOWARD ONE WHEN CONGRESS
ADJOURNED SO THAT CONGRESSMEN RUNNING FOR ELECTION COULD HAVE
SOMETHING TANGIBLE TO SAY TO THEIR CONSTITUENTS AS TO HOW AN
MTN AGREMENT WOULD SERVE LOCAL INTERESTS. WE HAD BEEN
TALKING ABOUT AN MTN FOR YEARS WITH NO RESULTS AND UNLESS SOMETHING WUS ACHIEVED NOW, DOMESTIC PROTECTIONIST SENTIMENT
WOULD BE EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO OVERCOME. AMBASSADOR WOLFF NOTED
THAT ALTHOUGH GSP WOULD REMAIN IN EFFECT UNTIL 1984, IT WAS
UNILATERAL AND HENCE COULD BE WITHDRAWN AT ANY TIME; ON THE
OTHER HAND, AN MTN AGREEMENT WHICH CONTAINED SOME DEGREE OF
RECIPROCITY WOULD, IF WITHDRAWN, REQUIRE US TO GIVE SOMETHING
UP AND ACCORDINGLY HAD A GREATER DEGREE OF PERMANENCE. WE WERE
NOT ASKING FOR FULL RECIPROCITY, BUT BELIEVED IT WAS IMPORTANT
FOR ALL COUNTRIES, INCLUDING THE LDCS, TO EFFECT TARIFF REDUCTIONS WHERE THEY COULD AFFORD IT. AMBASSADOR WOLFF STRESSED
AGAIN THE URGENT NEED TO REACH AN AGREEMENT THIS YEAR.
7. WITH REGARD TO RECIPROCITY, PM LEE ASKED IF THERE
WERE ANY COUNTRIES AMONG THE LDCS WHICH MIGHT BE COUNTED
ON TO GO ALONG. AMBASSADOR WOLFF MENTIONED MEXICO, AND ALSO
POSSIBLY INDIA AND BRAZIL. PM LEE SAID THAT INDIAN POTENTIAL
FOR LEADERSHIP AMONG THE LDCS ON THIS AND OTHER MATTERS HAD
PERHAPS BEEN UNDERESTIMATED, AND THOUGHT THAT MEXICO WITHOUT
SECRET
SECRET
PAGE 02

SINGAP 00641 02 OF 04 110716Z

ECHEVERRIA MIGHT ALSO BE HELPFUL ON ECONOMIC ISSUES. HE DISCOUNTED
THE ROLE OF BRAZIL, HOWEVER, ON GROUNDS THAT THE BRAZILIAN
GENERALS BELIEVED CRITICISM OF THEIR DICTATORSHIP WOULD BE MADE
MORE DIFFICULT IF THEY ADHERED TO THE STRAIGHT LDC LINE.
HE SUGGESTED THAT WE WERE THEREFORE OVERESTIMATING BRAZILIAN
FLEXIBILITY AND WILLINGNESS TO ASSERT LEADERSHIP. (NOTE:
SINGAPORE ITSELF IS CONSIDERING OFFERING RECIPROCITY TO THE U.S.
IN TARIFF CUTS ON A NUMBER OF ITEMS IF AGREEMENT CAN BE REACHED
ON U.S. CONSIDERATION OF EXPORT ITEMS OF INTEREST IN SINGAPORE.)
8. AMBASSADOR WOLFF WENT ON TO OUTLINE THE U.S. VIEW THAT THE LDCS
SHOULD TAKE A MORE POSITIVE PART IN THE MTN NEGOTIATIONS. THEIR
POSITION APPEARED TO BE THAT THE LDCS SHOULD WAIT UNTIL THE BASIC
MTN NEGOTIATIONS WERE COMPLETED, AND THEN ASK FOR
PREFERENTIAL TREATMENT, BUT WE FELT THAT IT WAS IMPERATIVE FOR
THEM TO HELP REACH A BASIC AGREEMENT. ALTHOUGH MANY OF THE LDCS
SAID THEY AGREED WITH US IN PRIVATE, THEY NEVERTHELESS
TOOK A PUBLIC POSITION WHICH WAS NOT HELPFUL. AMBASSADOR WOLFF
ADDED THAT THIS LDC STANCE GAVE ENCOURAGEMENT TO THOSE IN
THE U.S., JAPAN, AND EEC WHO FAVORED REACHING AN MTN AGREEMENT

AMONG THESE COUNTRIES AND FORGETTING ABOUT THE LDCS.
9. PM LEE DECLARED THAT HE WAS WHOLLY IN ACCORD. HE
HAD NO USE FOR THE G-77 LINE, WHICH CALLED FOR THE DEVELOPED
COUNTRIES TO MAKE ALL THE CONCESSIONS WITHOUT ANY OBLIGATION
ON THE PART OF THE LDCS. ALL THAT SUCH COUNTRIES WERE DOING
WAS EXTENDING A BEGGING BOWL AND SAYING &quot;GIVE.&quot; SINGAPORE
BELIEVED IN THE FREE ENTERPRISE SYSTEM AND IN OVENING ITS MARKET
TO THE DEVELOPED COUNTRIES, WHILE AT THE SAME TIME EXPORTING
ITS OWN PRODUCTS IN RETURN. IN FACT, SINGAPORE ITSELF REPRESENTED THE NEW INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC ORDER, DEVELOPMENT THROUGH
TRADE AND INVESTMENT, AND MOST OF THE G-77 KNEW THAT WHAT
THEY WERE TALING ABOUT WAS BUNK. PM LEE REITERATED A POINT

PAGE 03

SINGAP 00641 02 OF 04 110716Z

WHICH HE HAS MADE PREVIOUSLY ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS: &quot;WE'RE PLUGGED
INTO YOUR GRID.&quot;
10. PM LEE EXPRESSED THE OPINION THAT THE U.S. ITSELF WAS PARTLY
TO BLAME FOR THE LDC ATTITUDE. LACK OF A FIRM STAND ON OUR
PART HAD ALLOWED THE LDCS TO MAINTAIN AN UNNATURAL SOLIDARITY.
HE HAD DISCUSSED THIS WITH DICK COOPER, AND COOPER HAD AGREED.
FOR EXAMPLE, IN RESPONSE TO THE LDC CALL FOR THE CAPITAL C,
CAPITAL F, &quot;COMMON FUND,&quot; WE HAD SAID WE WOULD SUPPORT A
&quot;COMMON FUND&quot; SMALL C, SMALL F. ALTHOUGH THE U.S. HAD SAID
THAT THE TERMS OF THIS LATTER COMMON FUND HAD YET TO BE WORKED
OUT, THE HARDLINERS AMONG THE G-77 HAD PICKED UP THE U.S.
POSITION AND WERE NOW SAYING WE SUPPORTED THE FORMER. IN SINGAPORE'S
CONVERSATIONS WITH VARIOUS LDCS IT HAD BEEN AMPLY
CLEAR THAT THEY UNDERSTOOD THE ISSUES INVOLVED, BUT WHEN THE
TIME CAME FOR THEM TO SPEAK UP PUBLICLY THEY FELL INTO LINE AND
FOLLOWED THE LEADERSHIP OF THE MORE RADICAL ELEMENTS REGARDLESS
OF THE FACT THAT THEY KNEW THEIR OWN INTERESTS WERE BEING COMPROMISED. PM LEE SAID IT WAS UP TO THE U.S. AND OTHER DEVELOPED
COUNTRIES NOT TO GIVE IN, BUT TO TAKE A FIRM POSITION ON ISSUES
INVOLVING TRADE AND DEVELOPMENT. THE MORE MODERATE LDCS
(INCLUDING BOTH OPEC AND NON-OPEC COUNTRIES) WOULD THEN BE MORE
LIKELY TO BREAK WITH THE LINE ESPOUSED BY THE RADICAL G-77 STATES.
11. PM LEE STATED THAT THE CLIMATE OF OPINION HE HAD DESCRIBED
EXTENDED EVEN TO THE COMMONWEALTH SECRETARIAT IN LONDON
WHERE, INCREDIBLY, THEY WANTED THE LDCS TO GIVE UP MTN.
HE CALLED TO HIS SECRETARY TO BRING A PAPER PRODUCED BY THE
COMMONWEALTH SECRETARIAT FOR DISCUSSION AT THE FORTHCOMING
COMMONWEALTH REGIONAL HEADS OF GOVERNMENT MEETING IN SYDNEY,
AND SHOWED A SECTION WHICH DECLARED THAT THE INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC ORDER ESTABLISHED IN 1944 HAD WORKED TO THE BENEFIT OF
THE DEVELOPED COUNTRIES RATHER THAN THE LDCS, AND THAT THE
LDCS SHOULD ACCORDINGLY REJECT THIS ORDER AND ITS EXISTING
PATTERNS OF TRADE BETWEEN LDCS AND DEVELOPED COUNTRIES

SUCH A SITUATION, THE PAPER SAID, IT MIGHT BE NECESSARY
FOR THE &quot;MORE DEVELOPED&quot; LDCS TO MAKE CONCESSIONS TO THE
OTHERS. PM LEE WONDERED RHETORICALLY WHO THESE MORE DEVELOPED
LDCS WERE, AND COMMENTED THAT HE ASSUMED IT MEANT SINGAPORE
AMONG OTHERS. HE TERMED THIS PAPER &quot;NONSENSE.&quot;
AUSTRALIAN PRIME MINISTER FRASER HAD ASKED HIM TO OPEN THE MEETING
IN SYDNEY BY SPEAKING TO IT, AND HE WOULD DO SO BY KNOCKING IT
DOWN.
12. AMBASSADOR WOLFF SAID IN REFERENCE TO THE TOKYO ROUND IN
GENEVA THAT WE WOULD LIKE PM LEE'S HELP. WHEN PM LEE ASKED
&quot;IN WHAT WAY?&quot; AMBASSADOR WOLFF REPLIED&quot; BY EXPRESSING PUBLICLY
IN MEETINGS SUCH AS THE GATT THE POSITION YOU TAKE IN PRIVATE.&quot;
PM LEE SAID THAT SINGAPORE HAD DELIBERATELY ADOPTED A
POLICY IN THE GATT TO &quot;LAY LOW.&quot; HE WOULD LIKE TO HELP; HOWEVER,
IF SINGAPORE SPOKE UP PUBLICLY &quot;WE'LL BE LYNCHED.&quot; HE WENT
ON TO SAY THAT SINGAPORE WAS ALREADY REGARDED WITH SUSPICION BY THE RADICAL LEADERSHIP OF THE G-77 STATES, WHO KNEW
WHERE HE, LEE, REALLY STOOD. HE HAD MADE THIS PLAIN WHEN
HE HAD REFUSED TO ATTEND THE NONALIGNED SUMMIT MEETING IN COLOMBO
BUT HAD HIS SPEECH READ, INSTEAD. HE HAD USED THE WORLD &quot;LYNCHED&quot;
BECAUSE THIS WAS PRECISELY WHAT HE HAD BEEN TOLD BY HIS U.N.
AMBASSADOR, A &quot;QUITE GOOD MAN,&quot; IN THE EVENT THAT SINGAPORE TOOK
A POSITION CONTRARY TO THAT OF THE OTHER G-77 LDC GROUP. WHAT
SINGAPORE FEARED WAS TO BE ISOLATED; THAT IS, TO BE ATTACKED
BY OTHER LDCS AS A COUNTRY WHICH WAS NO LONGER DEVELOPING BUT
WHICH WAS DEVELOPED, AND THUS LOOSE THE BENEFITS IT NOW ENJOYED
IN ITS CURRENT LDC STATUS.

EXDIS
13. PM LEE EXPLAINED THE HISTORY OF SINGAPORE SINCE IT HAD BEEN
EXPELLED FROM MALAYSIA IN 1965 AND HOW IT HAD REACHED ITS
PRESENT STATUS BOTH BY HARD WORK AND BY BENEFITING FROM ITS
EXPORTS TO MARKETS WHERE IT HAD RECEIVED
PREFERENCES, THANKS TO ITS BEING AN LDC. HE ALSO OUTLINED
THE THREATS TO ITS LDC STATUS WHICH IT HAD ALREADY ENCOUNTERED
RECENTLY, INCLUDING LOSS OF OPIC COVERAGE, AND ITS CLASSIFICATION
AS A DEVELOPED COUNTRY WITH RESPECT TO IMF GOLD SALES. IN SHIS
LATTER REGARD HE NOTED THAT THE IMF MOVE WAS A POLITICAL ONE
DESIGNED TO ASSURE CONTINUED ARAB CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE IMF:
IN ORDER TO REMOVE ISRAEL FROM THE DEVELOPING CATEGORY, A NUMBER
OF OTHER COUNTRIES HAD TO BE SIMILARLY TREATED, AND SINGAPORE
WAS ONE ALONG WITH PORTUGAL AND GREECE.
14. PM LEE ALSO OUTLINED THE PROBLEMS WHICH WOULD BE
CREATED FOR SINGAPORE BY WITHDRAWAL OF TAX DEFERRAL ON FOREIGN
U.S. INVESTMENTS AND REDUCTION OF TAX DECUCTIONS GRANTED
U.S. BUSINESSMEN UNDER SECTION 911. HE STRESSED THAT SINGAPORE
WAS NOT IN REALITY A DEVELOPED COUNTRY. IF THE 30,000 OR SO
EXPATRIATES IN SINGAPORE WHO MADE UP MUCH OF ITS MANAGERIAL AND
ENTREPRENEURIAL CLASS WERE REMOVED FROM THE PICTURE, SINGAPORE'S
PER CAPITA GNP WOULD BE REDUCED FROM ITS PRESENT LEVEL OF
US$2,500 PER ANNUN TO AROUND US$1,000 PER ANNUM, WHICH WOULD
BE A MUCH FAIRER PICTURE OF WHERE SINGAPORE STOOD IN ITS DEVELOPMENT. IN FACT, SINGAPORE WAS PREPARING A STUDY ON THIS
SECRET

SUBJECT FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE IMF AND OTHERS WHICH WOULD PROVIDE
SOME SURPRISES. IT WOULD BE AT LEAST 10 OR 15 YEARS BEFORE
SINGAPORE WOULD REALLY REACH DEVELOPED STATUS, PROVIDED NO WAR
OR DEPRESSION OR OTHER CATACLYSM INTERFERED.
15. PM LEE THEN SAID &quot;WE'LL HELP YOU.&quot; DESPITE THE POSSIBILITY
THAT SINGAPORE MIGHT BE ISOLATED FROM THE G77, LDC GROUP,
SINGAPORE WOULD BE WILLING TO DO WHAT IT COULD IN SUPPORT OF AN
MTN. HOWEVER, TO COMPENSAGE FOR POSSIBLE DIFFICULTIES ARISING
AS A RESULT OF G77, LDC CRITICISM, HE HOPED THE U.S. WOULD
BE HELPFUL FOR ITS PART WITH RESPECT TO SUCH ISSUES AS TAX
DEFERRAL, AND OTHER INCENTIVES TO U.S. INVESTMENT IN SINGAPORE.
HE ALSO HOPED THAT THE U.S. WOULD CONTINUE GRANTING GSP TO
SINGAPORE. HE STRESSED AGAIN THAT SINGAPORE WAS NOT A DEVELOPED
COUNTRY, NOR SHOULD IT BE CONSIDERED ONE UNTIL PER CAPITAL INCOME
OF THE NON-EXPATRIATE ELEMENT OF SINGAPORE'S POPULATION REACHED,
SAY, US$4,000, IN AROUND 10 YEARS' TIME. THE U.S. SHOULD TELL HIM
WHAT TO DO TO BE HELPFUL AND HE WOULD DO IT (HOPEFULLY NOT TO

THE POINT OF ISOLATING SINGAPORE AND LOSING INFLUENCE). HE
SUGGESTED THAT THE U.S. AMBASSADOR BE USED AS A CHANNEL THROUGH
WHICH FURTHER COMMUNICATIONS COULD BE HANDLED ON THIS SUBJECT,
AND AMBASSADOR WOLFF PROMISED TO SEND HIM U.S. VIEWS ON WHAT
PM LEE MIGHT DO THROUGH THE AMBASSADOR.
16. PM LEE ALSO PROMISED TO SEND A STRONG SPOKESMAN TO
GENEVA WHO UNDERSTOOD HIS VIEWS AND COULD PRESENT THEM, ONCE
HE KNEW WHAT WAS NEEDED.THIS INDIVIDUAL MIGHT NOT BE ON
A PERMANENT BASIS SINCE SINGAPORE'S RESOURCES OF QUALIFIED PERSONNEL WERE LIMITED, BUT WOULD BE SENT FOR THE PERIOD REQUIRED.
LOOKING TO THE FUTURE OF THE WORLD ECONOMIC SYSTEM,
HE CONCURRED WITH AMBASSADOR WOLFF THAT IT WAS THE SHAPE OF
THE SYSTEM AND NOT SPECIAL AND DIFFERENTIAL TREATMENT THAT MATTERED
MOST.

17. AMBASSADOR WOLFF AND PM LEE TOUCHED ON THE SUBJECT OF THE GROSS
IMBALANCE IN THE WORLD BALANCES OF PAYMENTS DUE TO THE HUGH
SURPLUS EARNED BY THE OPEC COUNTRIES. PM LEE SUGGESTED THAT
THE OPEC COUNTRIES SHOULD CARRY THE COST OF DEVELOPMENT FOR
OTHER LDCS THROUGH ANY INSTITUTION THEY CARED TO USE: WORLD
BANK, REGIONAL BANKS OR THE ARAB BANK (WHICH HE MAINTAINED DID
NOTHING SIGNIFICANT TO HELP NON-ARAB LDCS.) HE OFFERED AN
ADDITIONAL THOUGHT:TO PICK UP AN IDEA WHICH HAD BEEN PUT FORWARD
PRIVATELY SOME YEARS EARLIER BY THE SHAH OR IRAN TO ESTABLISH
SOME SORT OF REGIONAL GROUPING AMONG MODERATE LDCS TO INCLUDE
IRAN, PAKISTAN, THE NON-COMMUNIST SOUTHEAST ASIAN NATIONS,
AND PERHAPS INDIA. THIS CONCEPT HAD APPARENTLY FALLEN BY THE
WAYWIDE WITH BHUTTO'S REMOVAL FROM POLITICAL POWER, BUT
MIGHT STILL HAVE SOME POTENTIALITIES. PM LEE EXPRESSED ADMIRATION FOR THE SHAH AS A MAN POSSESSING CONSIDERABLE VISION
AND AN AWARENESS OF WORLD REALITIES.
18. APROPOS OF OPEC, PM LEE REMARKED THAT ITS SUCCESS HAD
GIVEN RISE TO EFFORTS AMONG PRODUCERS OF OTHER COMMODITIES TO
SET UP SIMILAR GROUPINGS TO KEEP UP THE PRICE OF THEIR PARTICULAR RAW MATERIALS. HOWEVER, HE SAW LITTLE LIKELIHOOD THAT SUCH CARTELS WOULD BE SUCCESSFUL.
19. AMBASSADOR WOLFF ASKED PM LEE IF HE HAD FELT ANY APPREHENSIONS
ABLUT U.S. POLICY IN THE REGION WITH THE ADVENT OF
THE NEW ADMINISTRATION. PM LEE REPLIED THAT THE U.S. TROOP
REDUCTION IN KOREA HAD INDEED GIVEN RISE TO APPREHENSIONS AS
IT SUGGESTED A DIMINISHED INTEREST IN THE REGION.
HE MENTIONED THERE HAD SUBSEQUENTLY BEEN NUMEROUS STATEMENTS FROM
SENIOR U.S. OFFICIALS THAT THE U.S. INTENDED TO REMAIN A FORCE
IN THE REGION, AND HE INDICATED IN THE CONTEXT OF HIS REMARKS
THAT HE HAD ACCEPTED THESE STATEMENTS. HOWEVER, THE MOST EFFEC-

20. IN A FURTHER COMMENT ON U.S. POLICY, PM LEE REFERRED TO
HIS OWN STUDY OF MAO TSE-TUNG, A NECESSITY TO HIM BECAUSE HIS
OPPONENTS ALSO STUDIED MAO, AND STRESSED THAT ONE KEY LESSON
HE HAD LEARNED FROM HIS READNS WAS NOT TO FIGHT MORE THAN
ONE ENEMY AT A TIME. THIS WAS THE IMPORT OF MAO'S THESIS ON
DIFFERENTIATING BETWEEN ONE'S ENEMIES AND ONE'S FRIEDS.
21. DIGRESSING FROM WHAT HE APPARENTLY INTENDED TO BE A
REFERENCE TO THE MANY ISSUES THE ADMINISTRATION IS NOW
CONFRONTING, PM LEE THEN SPOKE OF THE PERSONAL LESSON HE HAD
LEARNED FROM STUDYING MAO, WHO HAD FIRST JOINED WITH KUOMINTANG
AGAINST THE JAPANESE AND THEN TURNED AGAINST THE KUOMINTANG
WITH THE SUPPORT OF THE SO-CALLED NATIONAL BOURGEOISIE AFTER
THE JAPANESE DEFEAT. MAO FINALLY TURNED AGAINST THE
NATIONAL BOURGEOISIE. IN SINGAPORE, LEE HIMSELF HAD JOINED WITH
THE COMMUNISTS AGAINST THE BRITISH BECAUSE THE COMMUNISTS WERE
WILLING TO FIGHT, BUT AFTER THE BRITISH DEPARTED HE HAD LOOKED
AROUND TO SEE WHO THE COMMUNISTS' NEXT OPPONENT MIGHT BE AND
SUDDENTLY DISCOVERED HE WAS IT. KNOWING THAT HE COMMUNISTS
WOULD TRY TO DESTROY HIM, HE RESOLVED TO MOVE FIRST. FORTUNATELY,
THE COMMUNISTS MADE SOME MISTAKES WHICH PUT THEM ON THE OTHER

SIDE OF THE FENCE FROM THE PEOPLE, AND HE WAS THEREFORE ABLE TO
ISOLATE AND DESTOY THEM INSTEAD OF THE REVERSE. AMBASSADOR
WOLFF NOTED THAT IT WAS UNCLEAR WHETHER MAO'S THEORY
WOULD BE USEFUL FOR THE U.S. IN CURRENT RELATIONS WITH

THE SUPERPOWERS. PM LEE AGREED, BUT FELT IT HAD SOME APPLICATION
TO RELATIONS BETWEEN THE DEVELOPED POWERS AND THE LDCS.
22. IN CONCLUSION, PM LEE SAID AGAIN THAT HE WOULD BE WILLING
TO HELP OUT WITH RESPECT TO THE MTN IF WE TOLD HIM WHAT HE SHOULD
DO. AS WE WERE ALL WALKING TOWARD THE DOOR, HE SAID
THAT HE WAS AT A LOSS TO UNDERSTAND WHY THE G77, LDC GROUP
TOOK SUCH EXTREME POSITIONS, AND COULD ONLY CONCLUDE THAT THE
RADICAL STATES HOPED THAT THROUGH THEIR LEADERSHIP OF THIS GROUP
THEY COULE EVENTUALLY BREAKUP THE ENTIRE WORLD ECONOMIC
ORDER.
