		<h3>Tor</h3>
		<p><a href="https://www.torproject.org">Tor</a> is an encrypted anonymising network that makes it harder to intercept internet communications, or see where communications are coming from or going to.</p>
		<p>In order to use the WikiLeaks public submission system as detailed above you can download the Tor Browser Bundle, which is a Firefox-like browser available for Windows, Mac OS X and GNU/Linux and pre-configured to connect using the anonymising system Tor.</p>
		<h4>Tails</h4>
		<p>If you are at high risk and you have the capacity to do so, you can also access the submission system through a secure operating system called <a href="https://tails.boum.org">Tails</a>. Tails is an operating system launched from a USB stick or a DVD that aim to leaves no traces when the computer is shut down after use and automatically routes your internet traffic through Tor. Tails will require you to have either a USB stick or a DVD at least 4GB big and a laptop or desktop computer.</p>

		<h3>Tips</h3>
		<p>Our submission system works hard to preserve your anonymity, but we recommend you also take some of your own precautions. Please review these basic guidelines. </p>
		<div>
			<h4>1. Contact us if you have specific problems</h4>
			<p>If you have a very large submission, or a submission with a complex format, or are a high-risk source, please <a href="#submit_help_contact">contact us</a>. In our experience it is always possible to find a custom solution for even the most seemingly difficult situations.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h4>2. What computer to use</h4>
			<p>If the computer you are uploading from could subsequently be audited in an investigation, consider using a computer that is not easily tied to you. Technical users can also use <a href="https://tails.boum.org">Tails</a> to help ensure you do not leave any records of your submission on the computer.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h4>3. Do not talk about your submission to others</h4>
			<p>If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in source protection – it is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This includes other media organisations.</p>
		</div>

	</div>

		<h3>After</h3>

		<div>
			<h4>1. Do not talk about your submission to others</h4>
			<p>If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in source protection – it is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This includes other media organisations.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h4>2. Act normal</h4>
			<p>If you are a high-risk source, avoid saying anything or doing anything after submitting which might promote suspicion. In particular, you should try to stick to your normal routine and behaviour.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h4>3. Remove traces of your submission</h4>
			<p>If you are a high-risk source and the computer you prepared your submission on, or uploaded it from, could subsequently be audited in an investigation, we recommend that you format and dispose of the computer hard drive and any other storage media you used.</p>
			<p>In particular, hard drives retain data after formatting which may be visible to a digital forensics team and flash media (USB sticks, memory cards and SSD drives) retain data even after a secure erasure. If you used flash media to store sensitive data, it is important to destroy the media.</p>
			<p>If you do this and are a high-risk source you should make sure there are no traces of the clean-up, since such traces themselves may draw suspicion.</p>
			<div>
				<h4>4. If you face legal action</h4>
				<p>If a legal action is brought against you as a result of your submission, there are organisations that may help you. The Courage Foundation is an international organisation dedicated to the protection of journalistic sources. You can find more details at <a href="https://www.couragefound.org">https://www.couragefound.org</a>.</p>

		<p>WikiLeaks publishes documents of political or historical importance that are censored or otherwise suppressed. We specialise in strategic global publishing and large archives.</p>
		<p>The following is the address of our secure site where you can anonymously upload your documents to WikiLeaks editors. You can only access this submissions system through Tor. (See our <a href="#submit_help_tor">Tor tab</a> for more information.) We also advise you to read our <a href="#submit_help_tips">tips for sources</a> before submitting.</p>

			<!--<div>
				Copy this address into your Tor browser. Advanced users, if they wish, can also add a further layer of encryption to their submission using <a href="#submit_wlkey">our public PGP key</a>.
			</div>-->
		</div>

		<p>If you cannot use Tor, or your submission is very large, or you have specific requirements, WikiLeaks provides several alternative methods. <a href="#submit_help_contact">Contact us</a> to discuss how to proceed.</p>

LT. GOV. CHARLES ROBB (REFTEL) AND PRC VICE PREMIER
GENG BIAO ON AUGUST 7. THE TRANSCRIPT HAS NOT BEEN
CLEARED BY THE DELEGATION.
4. GENG: I WOULD LIKE TO WELCOME YOU. I WOULD LIKE
TO WELCOME AMBASSADOR WOODCOCK AND ALL OTHER MEMBERS
OF THE DELEGATION. IN ANOTHER TWO DAYS YOU WILL BE
LEAVING FOR OTHER CITIES. IN THE PAST, THERE WAS NOT
ENOUGHT CONTACT BETWEEN OUR TWO COUNTRIES. WE DID
NOT KNOW EACH OTHER VERY WELL. IT IS VERY BENEFICIAL

FOR BOTH OF US TO VISIT OUR RESPECTIVE COUNTRIES.
OUR COUNTRY IS RATHER BACKWARD COMPARED TO YOUR
COUNTRY. IT IS ALSO BACKWARD COMPARED TO WESTERN
EUROPE. WE KNOW WE ARE BACKWARD. WE HAVE MADE
EFFORTS TO CHANGE THE STATE OF AFFAIRS. IS THIS YOUR
FIRST TRIP?

ROBB: THIS IS THE FIRST TIME FOR EACH MEMBER OF THE
DELEGATION.
GENG: I AM SURE THAT SOME OF YOU WILL COME BACK
A THIRD OR A FOURTH TIME. WE KNOW THAT YOUR TIME IS
LIMITED SO THAT YOU CANNOT SEE ALL OF CHINA. WHEN
YOU COME BACK YOU CAN SEE MORE. I WANT TO TELL YOU
BRIEFLY ABOUT CHINA'S SITUATION. SINCE THE BEGINNING
OF THIS YEAR WE HAVE SHIFTED OUR EMPHASIS TOWARD
BUILDING OUR COUNTRY. IN THE PAST SEVEN MONTHS OR
SO WE HAVE SHIFTED WORK TO EMPHASIZE SOCIALIST
CONSTRUCTION UNDER THE LEADERSHIP OF THE GOVERNMENT.
OUR MODERNIZATION GOAL IS CHINESE-STYLE
MODERNIZATION. WE HOPE TO REACH THIS GOAL BY THE END
OF THIS CENTURY. WHAT WE MEAN IS THAT WE HOPE WE
CAN REACH YOUR PRESENT LEVEL, THAT IS THE LEVEL OF
THE UNITED STATES IN THE 1970S. OUR CONDITIONS
ARE BACKWARD BUT WE ARE ALSO MAKING PROGRESS. WE
HAVE TWENTY YEARS AHEAD OF US AND YOU HAVE TWENTY
YEARS AHEAD OF YOU. BECAUSE OF OBJECTIVE AND SUBJECTIVE FACTORS, WE HAVE MADE VERY LITTLE PROGRESS.
BUT DUE MAINLY TO SUBJECTIVE REASONS, WE ARE STILL
BACKWARD. IT WAS NOT ONLY SUBJECTIVE REASONS, OF
COURSE; WE ALSO MET OBJECTIVE DIFFICULTIES. SPEAKING
FRANKLY, THE U.S. AND THE SOVIET UNION EMBARGOED CHINA
IN THE PAST. THESE ARE THE OBJECTIVE FACTORS. BUT

WE WERE ALSO RATHER CONSERVATIVE IN THE PAST. I CAN
GIVE YOU SEVERAL EXAMPLES, FOR INSTANCE, YOU SEE
THIS THERMOS? THIS HAS REMAINED UNCHANGED IN THE
PAST FORTY YEARS. THIS IS ALSO THE CASE FOR
BICYCLES. YOU SEE THEM BEING RIDDEN BY PEOPLE NEAR
THE PEKING HOTEL, ALONG CHANG AN AVENUE. IN TERMS
OF QUALITY, THE BICYCLES ARE NOT AS GOOD AS BEFORE.
THEY ARE ONE OR TWO KILOGRAMS HEAVIER. THE QUALITY
OF STEEL IS NOT AS GOOD. FROM THESE TWO EXAMPLES
YOU CAN SEE HOW CONSERVATIVE WE WERE.
THERE WAS AN ABSENCE OF COMPETITION BETWEEN THE
FACTORIES AND BETWEEN PRICES. QUALITY ALSO WAS NOT
HIGH ENOUGH. WE TALK ABOUT REALIZING THE FOUR
MODERNIZATIONS. WE ALSO TALK ABOUT PEOPLE EMANCIPATING THEIR MINDS. PEOPLE WILL THINK OF IMPROVING
THE QUALITY OF PRODUCTS, LIKE STARTING UP MACHINERY.
PEOPLE ARE MAKING GREAT EFFORTS TO IMPROVE QUALITY.
WE WANT TO INSTITUTE THE FOUR MODERNIZATIONS MAINLY
FOR THE PURPOSE OF MEETING PEOPLE'S NEEDS. WE HAVE
GONE THROUGH THIRTY YEARS SINCE LIBERATION. THE
PEOPLE'S LIVELIHOOD NEEDED TO BE IMPROVED. IN A LOT
OF RESPECTS, AND ON A NATION-WIDE SCALE, PEOPLE'S

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014

NOT HAVE ENOUGHT PRODUCTS FOR THE PEOPLE.

IN THE PAST WE CONCENTRATED ON CONSTRUCTION IN
THREE ASPECTS: HEAVY INDUSTRY, LIGHT INDUSTRY AND
AGRICULTURE. IN THE PAST WE ALSO HAD A TEN-YEAR
PLAN. NOW WE ARE IN A PERIOD OF READJUSTMENT. THIS
MEANS INCREASED INVESTMENT IN AGRICULTURE. IN ORDER
TO INCREASE THE MOBILIZATION AND ENTHUSIASM OF THE
PEASANTS, WE HAVE INCREASED THE PRICE OF GRAIN THE
STATE PAYS TO THE COMMUNIES BY TWENTY PERCENT.
HOWEVER, THE MARKET PRICE OF GRAIN IN THE CITIES
STAYS THE SAME. THE GOVERNMENT IS SUBSIDIZING THIS
ARRANGEMENT BY MAKING UP THE BALANCE. ACCORDING TO
OUR INVESTIGATION, LIFE IN THE COUNTRYWIDE IS MORE
DIFFICULT THAN IN THE FACTORIES AND STATE OFFICES.
AND WE HAVE SEEN IMMEDIATE RESULTS IN AGRICULTURAL
PRODUCTION. FOR EXAMPLE, WE HAVE TWO HARVESTS, IN
SUMMER AND IN FALL. WE HAVE ACHIEVED INCREASES IN
THIS SUMMER'S HARVEST. NOW DIFFERENT COMMUNIES ARE
ADOPTING DIFFERENT MEASURES. WE ESTIMATE THAT AN
INCREASE WILL ALSO BE ACHIEVED IN THE FALL HARVEST.
FOR THE PEOPLE'S NEEDS, THE GRAIN PRODUCTION IS BEING
INCREASED.
WE ARE ALSO BEING FACED WITH A LARGE INCREASE
IN POPULATION. WE HAVE A LARGE POULATION, OVER

900 MILLION. THE SHORTAGE IN AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION
WILL BE AN OBSTACLE TO INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT.
ACCORDING TO OUR PLAN, 400 MILLION TONS OF GRAIN
WERE TO BE PRODUCED IN 1985. THIS WAS THE ORIGINAL
PLAN. LAST YEAR, WE PRODUCED 320 MILLION TONS OF
GRAIN. ON THE AVERAGE, EACH PERSON CAN GET SOMETHING
OVER 300 KILOGRAMS. THAT IS NOT MUCH. BY 1985,
EVEN IF GRAIN PRODUCTION REACHES 400 MILLION TONS,
THE POPULATION WILL GROW AS WELL. WE HAVE ONLY
SIX MORE YEARS UNTIL 1985. IF THE POPULATION GROWS
TO ONE BILLION, THE GRAIN QUOTA FOR EACH PERSON
WOULD BE 400 KILOGRAMS. THAT IS NOT MUCH OF AN
INCREASE. SO THE AVERAGE PERSON HAS ONLY 400
KILOGRAMS. IN ORDER TO STIMUATE THE PRODUCTION OF
GRAIN, WE HAVE INCREASED WATER CONSERVANCY METHODS,
FERTILIZERS, AND RAISED THE INCOME OF PEASANTS TO
STIMUATE THE PEASANTS' ENTHUSIASM. BY 1985 WE SHOULD
BE ABLE TO PRODUCE MORE THAN 400 MILLION TONS OF
GRAIN PER YEAR.
THE SECOND QUESTION IS THE NEED TO IMPROVE LIGHT
INDUSTRY. WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO SATISFY THE BASIC
NEEDS OF THE PEOPLE, INCLUDING CLOTHING. BY
INCREASING THE PEASANTS' INCOME, IT RAISES THEIR
PURCHASING POWER. THEY NEED MORE DAILY NECESSITIES.
AND BY DEVELOPING THE LIGHT INDUSTRIAL SECTOR, MORE
FUNDS WILL BE MADE AVAILABLE TO THE STATE. LIGHT
INDUSTRY CAN SUSTAIN A MUCH MORE RAPID GROWTH AND
DEVELOP FASTER, WHICH ACHIEVES A QUICKER TURNOVER,
THAN EMPHASIS ON HEAVY INDUSTRY. YOU CAN GAIN MORE
PROFITS BY STRESSING THE DEVELOPMENT OF LIGHT
INDUSTRY. SO, LIGHT INDUSTRY WILL GAIN A BIGGER
CAPACITY FASTER. IT IS EASIER TO DEVELOP.

TALKING ABOUT EMPHASIS. FIRST COMES AGRICULTURE,
SECOND LIGHT INDUSTRY, AND LASTLY HEAVY INDUSTRY.
HEAVY INDUSTRY INVOLVES NOT ONLY STEEL, ENERGY AND
MINERAL RESOURCES BUT ALSO TRANSPORTATION. IT NEEDS
RELATIVELY MORE INVESTMENT AND A LONGER TIME TO
DEVELOP. AT THE SAME TIME, HEAVY INDUSTRY NAQUIRES
POWER STATIONS. WITHOUT ELECTRICAL GENERATING
STATIONS, FACTORIES CANNOT BE PUT INTO OPERATION.
WE HAVE NOT USED OUR RESOURCES TO THE FULL. WE HAVE
GREAT POTENTIAL. IN THE PAST, THE USE OF NATURAL
WATER RESOURCES TO GENERATE ENECTRICITY WAS SLIGHTLY
MORE THAN TWO PERCENT OF AVAILABLE RESOURCES. THAT

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
MEANS WE DID NOT USE MORE THAN 97 PERCENT OF THE
POTENTIAL. WE WANT TO TAP THIS POTENTIAL. WE ALSO
HAVE RICH COAL RESERVES. IN THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS
WE HAVE EXPENDED GREAT ENERGIES TO INVESTIGATE OUR
NATURAL RESOURCES. WE HAVE DEVOTED A LOT OF EFFORT
TO FINDING OIL. I TELL MY FRIENDS THAT IN SHANXI
PROVINCE IN THE WEST THERE ARE A LOT OF COAL RESERVES.
IT IS HIGH QUALITY COAL. YOU CAN MAKE COKE OUT OF IT.
IF YOU MINE 200 BILLION METRIC TONS PER YEAR, YOU
WOULD NOT USE UP SHANXI'S RESOURCES IN ONE HUNDRED
YEARS. AND THIS IS ONLY THE COAL FROM 500 METERS
DEEP AND ABOVE. HOWEVER, WE HAVE SERIOUS TRANSPORTATION PROBLEMS. THERE IS ONLY ONE RAILROAD IN THE
AREA. SHANXI PROVINCE PLANS TO BUILD ELECTRICAL
POWER STATIONS TO SEND OUT ELECTRICITY INSTEAD OF
COAL. THIS IS MORE ECONOMICAL. WE ARE ALSO
CONSTRUCTING FACTORIES TO MAKE COAL INTO GAS AND
TRANSMIT IT IN PIPELINES MORE ECONOMICALLY.
NOW WE HAVE ONLY A SINGLE RAILROAD TRACK. WE CAN
MAKE IT A DOUBLE TRACK AND INCREASE RAILROAD VOLUME
BY 100 PERCENT. WE HAVE WORKED OUT THESE PLANS AND
WE ARE STRIVING TO IMPLEMENT THEM. AFTER WE HAVE
MET OUR NEEDS, WE CAN EXPORT THE SURPLUS.

CONTINENTAL OIL AS WELL AS OFFSHORE OIL. LAST
YEAR WE PRODUCED ONE HUNDRED MILLION TONS OF CRUDE
OIL, BUT WE EXPORTED ONLY TEN MILLION TONS. WE ARE

LONG AGO SOME AMERICAN FRIENDS OFFERED TO HELP EXTRACT
THE OIL. SEVEN U.S. COMPANIES WANT TO HELP EXPLORE
AND EXCAVATE THE OIL. SO MUCH FOR THE GENERAL PLAN.
REGARDING THE DEVELOPMENT OF CHINA'S ECOOMY,
WE ARE CONSTRUCTING ENTERPRISES. SOME OF THEM ARE
OPERATING AT A LOSS. WE HAVE MAINLY ACHIEVED ECONOMIC
OUTPUT TO CAPACITY IN THE LAST TWO YEARS. WE HAVE TO
CHANGE MANAGERIAL AND TECHNOLOGICAL LEVELS. WE HAVE

CONSOLIDATION, AND IMPROVEMENT.&quot; THE EMPHASIS IS
ON THE FIRST THREE WORDS. AFTER WE MEET THESE THREE
REQUIREMENTS, IMPROVEMENT CAN BE ACHIEVED. YOU WILL
HAVE BEEN TO SHANGHAI. SHANGHAI IS GOING ABOUT THIS

WE CONSTRUCT TOO MANY FACTORIES.
TALKING ABOUT READJUSTMENT, WE HAVE ALSO
PRODUCED SOME OIL. YEARS AGO, WE DIDN'T EXPORT IT,
HOWEVER. SOME FACTORIES CONVERTED FROM COAL USE TO
OIL USE. THESE FACTORIES ARE BEING RECONVERTED TO
COAL. WE NOW SAVE OIL FOR EXPORT TO EARN FOREIGN
EXCHANGE. SO MUCH FOR THE GENERAL PLAN. YOU CAN
CONCENTRATE ON THE STATISTICS ANNOUNCED AT THE
SECOND SESSION OF THE FIFTH NATIONAL PEOPLE'S CONGRESS.
I DON'T WANT TO REPEAT THESE NOW.
THERE IS ONE EXAMPLE IN SHAGHAI. THE FISHERMEN
USE ZHOU SHAN ISLAND AS A BASE. THERE ARE A LOT
OF JUNKS THERE BUT NOT MANY MOTORBOATS. IT TAKES
SEVERAL DAYS TO REACH THE FISHING GROUNDS. IT IS
NOT AN EASY TASK. WATER AND FOOD SUPPLIES OFTEN
RUN SHORT, FISH PRODUCTION USED TO BE 3,000 TONS
A DAY, BUT SOME OF THE FISH WOULD SPOIL BY THE TIME
THE BOATS RETURNED. WE HAVE NOW CONSTRUCTED
REFRIGERATED SHIPS. THE FISHERMEN GET FRESH WATER
AND FOOD FROM THE SHIP. THE SHIP IN TURN TAKES THE
FISH FROM THE BOATS. PRODUCTION HAS INCREASED BY
100 PERCENT. NOW, TOTAL PRODUCTION IS 6,000 TONS
A DAY. THIS METHOD ILLUSTRATES THE PROBLEM OF
MANAGEMENT AND TECHNOOOGY. IF WE MAKE THIS KIND
OF REORGANIZATION WE CAN DOUBLE OUR PRODUCTION. SO
NOW DIFFERENT FACTORIES ARE THINKING OF WAYS TO
INCREASE PRODUCTION.
I HAVE TALKED ABOUT CONSTRUCTION AND THE FOUR
MODERNIZATIONS. AFTER THE THIRD PLENUM OF THE
ELEVENTH CENTRAL COMMITTEE AND THE SECOND SESSION
OF THE FIFTH NATIONAL PEOPLE'S CONGRESS, WE HAVE

HAVE ALSO SET SOME GOALS. WE HAVE A LOT TO DO
INCLUDING ESTABLISHING LAWS. IN THE PAST THE GANG
OF OUR ROTTED PEOPLE'S MINDS AND THEY DID NOT ABIDE
BY LAWS. IT IS NECESSARY TO MAKE LAWS TO ACHIEVE
STABILITY, UNITY AND TRANQUILITY. IN THE
CONSTITUTION WE STIPULATED THE RIGHT TO STRIKE,
TO EXPRESS OPINIONS, TO PUT UP WALL POSTERS, TO
DEBATE. BUT THE ABSENCE OF LAWS MADE IT DIFFICULT
TO GUARANTEE THE BASIC RIGHTS OF THE CONSTITUTION.
LAST YEAR WE HAD DEMOCRACY WALL. THERE WERE SOME
DEMONSTRATIONS AND THESE WERE GUARANTEED BY LAW.
BUT SOME PEOPLE SMASHED SHOPS AND WENT BEYOND THE
LAW. THE GANG OF FOUR WANTED TO USURP STTE AND
PARTY POWER. WE OVERTHREW AND SMASHED THE GANG OF
FOUR. BUT THE INFLUENCE OF THE GANG OF FOUR IS
STILL PRESENT THREE YEARS LATER. AS THE CHINESE
SAYING GOES, THE PERNICIOUS INFLUENCE OF THE BANG
OF FOUR COULD AGAIN RAISE ITS UGLY HEAD. WHO KNOWS
IF THEY COULD COME BACK TO POWER SOME DAY. THE
LAWS AND REGULATIONS WILL BE IMPLEMENTED ON JANUARY 1,
1980. WE ARE NOW ALLOWING THE PEOPLE TO STUDY AND
UNDERSTAND THE LAW. THERE WILL BE TIME IN SHANGHAI,
PLUS SOME OTHER CITIES, FOR YOU TO SEE WHAT HAS BEEN
DONE. YOU WILL SEE WITH YOUR OWN EYES. YOU CAN GET
CLOSE TO THE PEOPLE, BUT UNFORTUNATELY NOT MANY
HAVE MASTERED ENGLISH (LAUFHTER).

SOME PEOPLE MAY ASK WHETHER CHINA IS DEPARTING
FROM CHAIRMAN MAO'S LINE IN PURSUING THE FOUR
MODERNIZATIONS. THIS IS NOT TRUE, SINCE THE LATE
CHAIRMAN MAO ATTENDED THE TENTH PARTY CONGRESS IN
1973 WHEN THE FOUR MODERNIZATIONS GOAL WAS
LAID OUT. PREMIER CHOU ALSO LAID THEM OUT IN HIS
REPORT ON GOVERNMENT WORK. THE GANG OF FOUR OPPOSED
AND NEGATED THE FOUR MODERNIZATIONS. WE HAVE TO
TELL PEOPLE THAT THE NEEDS OF THE MASSES MUST BE
PROVIDED FOR. WE HAVE A SOCIALIST COUNTRY. IF WE
DON'T RAISE LIVING STANDARDS, THEN WE CANNOT SHOW
THAT OUR SYSTEM IS SUPERIOR. WE HAVE TO INCREASE
PRODUCTION BECAUSE MONEY CANNOT DROP FROM THE SKY

STIPULATED THE LINE OF INDEPENDENCE IN POLITICS AND
SELF-RELIANCE IN ECONOMY. AT THE SAME TIME,
FOREIGN SUPPORT SHOULD ALSO BE SOUGHT WITH THE
EMPHASIS ON SELF-RELIANCE. FOR SOME TIME, FOREIGN
SUPPORT FOR ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT WAS NOT POSSIBIEL.

ON FOREIGN SUPPORT WAS A DISGRACE. TO SUM UP THE

CAME TO US. THE SOVIET UNION DID NOT AGREE WITH THE
PROPOSAL FOR THE PARIS NEGOTIATIONS. WE URGED VIETNAM
TO JOIN THE PARIS NEGOTIATIONS. WE WELCOMED YOUR
PRESIDENT NIXON TO CHINA IN 1972. AT THE TIME HE TOLD
US THE UNITED STATES HAD COMMITTED A MISTAKE IN ITS
STRATEGY. THE U.S. WAS SUFFERING IN AFRICA AND EUROPE.
IN ORDER TO STRENGTHEN THE U.S. POSITION IN AFRICA AND
EUROPE, WE URGED AND ENCOURAGED VIETNAM TO HAVE NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE UNITED STATES. BECAUSE VIETNAM WAS
CLOSE TO US AND YOUR ARMY WANTED TO GO TO EUROPE TO
FACE THE SOVIETS, WE AGREED WITH YOUR STRATEGY. WE
FELT AT EASE AFTER YOU WITHDREW FROM VIETNAM. BUT

THE SOVIET UNION.

IT WANTED TO RIG UP THE INDOCHINA FEDERATION AND
SWALLOW KAMPUCHEA. IT OCCUPIED THE XISHA ANDNANSHA

GUANGXI AND SOME OF THAILAND'S TERRITORY. WE DISCOVERED THEIR WILD AMBITIONS AND WARNED THEM, BUT THE

THEM FOR THEIR OWN MEGEMONISTIC DESIGN. IT BECAME THE

ATTACKED OUR BORDER AREA SOME 3,000 TIMES, INVOLVING

CONFLICT. THE ARMY DID NOT GO VERY FAR, ONLY TO A
DEPTH OF 30 KILOMATERS AT THE DEEPENST POINT. THE
VIETNAMESE HAD PENETRATED CHINA BY 35 KILOMETERS, SO
WE DID ALMOST THE SAME AMOUNT AS VIETNAM. BEFORE THE

ROBB: THIS IS THE FIRST TIME FOR EACH MEMBER OF THE
DELEGATION.
GENG: I AM SURE THAT SOME OF YOU WILL COME BACK
A THIRD OR A FOURTH TIME. WE KNOW THAT YOUR TIME IS
LIMITED SO THAT YOU CANNOT SEE ALL OF CHINA. WHEN
YOU COME BACK YOU CAN SEE MORE. I WANT TO TELL YOU
BRIEFLY ABOUT CHINA'S SITUATION. SINCE THE BEGINNING
OF THIS YEAR WE HAVE SHIFTED OUR EMPHASIS TOWARD
BUILDING OUR COUNTRY. IN THE PAST SEVEN MONTHS OR
SO WE HAVE SHIFTED WORK TO EMPHASIZE SOCIALIST
CONSTRUCTION UNDER THE LEADERSHIP OF THE GOVERNMENT.
OUR MODERNIZATION GOAL IS CHINESE-STYLE
MODERNIZATION. WE HOPE TO REACH THIS GOAL BY THE END
OF THIS CENTURY. WHAT WE MEAN IS THAT WE HOPE WE
CAN REACH YOUR PRESENT LEVEL, THAT IS THE LEVEL OF
THE UNITED STATES IN THE 1970S. OUR CONDITIONS
ARE BACKWARD BUT WE ARE ALSO MAKING PROGRESS. WE
HAVE TWENTY YEARS AHEAD OF US AND YOU HAVE TWENTY
YEARS AHEAD OF YOU. BECAUSE OF OBJECTIVE AND SUBJECTIVE FACTORS, WE HAVE MADE VERY LITTLE PROGRESS.
BUT DUE MAINLY TO SUBJECTIVE REASONS, WE ARE STILL
BACKWARD. IT WAS NOT ONLY SUBJECTIVE REASONS, OF
COURSE; WE ALSO MET OBJECTIVE DIFFICULTIES. SPEAKING
FRANKLY, THE U.S. AND THE SOVIET UNION EMBARGOED CHINA
IN THE PAST. THESE ARE THE OBJECTIVE FACTORS. BUT

WE WERE ALSO RATHER CONSERVATIVE IN THE PAST. I CAN
GIVE YOU SEVERAL EXAMPLES, FOR INSTANCE, YOU SEE
THIS THERMOS? THIS HAS REMAINED UNCHANGED IN THE
PAST FORTY YEARS. THIS IS ALSO THE CASE FOR
BICYCLES. YOU SEE THEM BEING RIDDEN BY PEOPLE NEAR
THE PEKING HOTEL, ALONG CHANG AN AVENUE. IN TERMS
OF QUALITY, THE BICYCLES ARE NOT AS GOOD AS BEFORE.
THEY ARE ONE OR TWO KILOGRAMS HEAVIER. THE QUALITY
OF STEEL IS NOT AS GOOD. FROM THESE TWO EXAMPLES
YOU CAN SEE HOW CONSERVATIVE WE WERE.
THERE WAS AN ABSENCE OF COMPETITION BETWEEN THE
FACTORIES AND BETWEEN PRICES. QUALITY ALSO WAS NOT
HIGH ENOUGH. WE TALK ABOUT REALIZING THE FOUR
MODERNIZATIONS. WE ALSO TALK ABOUT PEOPLE EMANCIPATING THEIR MINDS. PEOPLE WILL THINK OF IMPROVING
THE QUALITY OF PRODUCTS, LIKE STARTING UP MACHINERY.
PEOPLE ARE MAKING GREAT EFFORTS TO IMPROVE QUALITY.
WE WANT TO INSTITUTE THE FOUR MODERNIZATIONS MAINLY
FOR THE PURPOSE OF MEETING PEOPLE'S NEEDS. WE HAVE
GONE THROUGH THIRTY YEARS SINCE LIBERATION. THE
PEOPLE'S LIVELIHOOD NEEDED TO BE IMPROVED. IN A LOT
OF RESPECTS, AND ON A NATION-WIDE SCALE, PEOPLE'S

IN THE PAST WE CONCENTRATED ON CONSTRUCTION IN
THREE ASPECTS: HEAVY INDUSTRY, LIGHT INDUSTRY AND
AGRICULTURE. IN THE PAST WE ALSO HAD A TEN-YEAR
PLAN. NOW WE ARE IN A PERIOD OF READJUSTMENT. THIS
MEANS INCREASED INVESTMENT IN AGRICULTURE. IN ORDER
TO INCREASE THE MOBILIZATION AND ENTHUSIASM OF THE
PEASANTS, WE HAVE INCREASED THE PRICE OF GRAIN THE
STATE PAYS TO THE COMMUNIES BY TWENTY PERCENT.
HOWEVER, THE MARKET PRICE OF GRAIN IN THE CITIES
STAYS THE SAME. THE GOVERNMENT IS SUBSIDIZING THIS
ARRANGEMENT BY MAKING UP THE BALANCE. ACCORDING TO
OUR INVESTIGATION, LIFE IN THE COUNTRYWIDE IS MORE
DIFFICULT THAN IN THE FACTORIES AND STATE OFFICES.
AND WE HAVE SEEN IMMEDIATE RESULTS IN AGRICULTURAL
PRODUCTION. FOR EXAMPLE, WE HAVE TWO HARVESTS, IN
SUMMER AND IN FALL. WE HAVE ACHIEVED INCREASES IN
THIS SUMMER'S HARVEST. NOW DIFFERENT COMMUNIES ARE
ADOPTING DIFFERENT MEASURES. WE ESTIMATE THAT AN
INCREASE WILL ALSO BE ACHIEVED IN THE FALL HARVEST.
FOR THE PEOPLE'S NEEDS, THE GRAIN PRODUCTION IS BEING
INCREASED.
WE ARE ALSO BEING FACED WITH A LARGE INCREASE
IN POPULATION. WE HAVE A LARGE POULATION, OVER

900 MILLION. THE SHORTAGE IN AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION
WILL BE AN OBSTACLE TO INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT.
ACCORDING TO OUR PLAN, 400 MILLION TONS OF GRAIN
WERE TO BE PRODUCED IN 1985. THIS WAS THE ORIGINAL
PLAN. LAST YEAR, WE PRODUCED 320 MILLION TONS OF
GRAIN. ON THE AVERAGE, EACH PERSON CAN GET SOMETHING
OVER 300 KILOGRAMS. THAT IS NOT MUCH. BY 1985,
EVEN IF GRAIN PRODUCTION REACHES 400 MILLION TONS,
THE POPULATION WILL GROW AS WELL. WE HAVE ONLY
SIX MORE YEARS UNTIL 1985. IF THE POPULATION GROWS
TO ONE BILLION, THE GRAIN QUOTA FOR EACH PERSON
WOULD BE 400 KILOGRAMS. THAT IS NOT MUCH OF AN
INCREASE. SO THE AVERAGE PERSON HAS ONLY 400
KILOGRAMS. IN ORDER TO STIMUATE THE PRODUCTION OF
GRAIN, WE HAVE INCREASED WATER CONSERVANCY METHODS,
FERTILIZERS, AND RAISED THE INCOME OF PEASANTS TO
STIMUATE THE PEASANTS' ENTHUSIASM. BY 1985 WE SHOULD
BE ABLE TO PRODUCE MORE THAN 400 MILLION TONS OF
GRAIN PER YEAR.
THE SECOND QUESTION IS THE NEED TO IMPROVE LIGHT
INDUSTRY. WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO SATISFY THE BASIC
NEEDS OF THE PEOPLE, INCLUDING CLOTHING. BY
INCREASING THE PEASANTS' INCOME, IT RAISES THEIR
PURCHASING POWER. THEY NEED MORE DAILY NECESSITIES.
AND BY DEVELOPING THE LIGHT INDUSTRIAL SECTOR, MORE
FUNDS WILL BE MADE AVAILABLE TO THE STATE. LIGHT
INDUSTRY CAN SUSTAIN A MUCH MORE RAPID GROWTH AND
DEVELOP FASTER, WHICH ACHIEVES A QUICKER TURNOVER,
THAN EMPHASIS ON HEAVY INDUSTRY. YOU CAN GAIN MORE
PROFITS BY STRESSING THE DEVELOPMENT OF LIGHT
INDUSTRY. SO, LIGHT INDUSTRY WILL GAIN A BIGGER
CAPACITY FASTER. IT IS EASIER TO DEVELOP.
THIRD PLACE GOES TO HEAVY INDUSTRY, WE ARE
CONFIDENTIAL

PAGE 03

BEIJIN 05273 02 OF 07 111735Z

TALKING ABOUT EMPHASIS. FIRST COMES AGRICULTURE,
SECOND LIGHT INDUSTRY, AND LASTLY HEAVY INDUSTRY.
HEAVY INDUSTRY INVOLVES NOT ONLY STEEL, ENERGY AND
MINERAL RESOURCES BUT ALSO TRANSPORTATION. IT NEEDS
RELATIVELY MORE INVESTMENT AND A LONGER TIME TO
DEVELOP. AT THE SAME TIME, HEAVY INDUSTRY NAQUIRES
POWER STATIONS. WITHOUT ELECTRICAL GENERATING
STATIONS, FACTORIES CANNOT BE PUT INTO OPERATION.
WE HAVE NOT USED OUR RESOURCES TO THE FULL. WE HAVE
GREAT POTENTIAL. IN THE PAST, THE USE OF NATURAL
WATER RESOURCES TO GENERATE ENECTRICITY WAS SLIGHTLY
MORE THAN TWO PERCENT OF AVAILABLE RESOURCES. THAT

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
MEANS WE DID NOT USE MORE THAN 97 PERCENT OF THE
POTENTIAL. WE WANT TO TAP THIS POTENTIAL. WE ALSO
HAVE RICH COAL RESERVES. IN THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS
WE HAVE EXPENDED GREAT ENERGIES TO INVESTIGATE OUR
NATURAL RESOURCES. WE HAVE DEVOTED A LOT OF EFFORT
TO FINDING OIL. I TELL MY FRIENDS THAT IN SHANXI
PROVINCE IN THE WEST THERE ARE A LOT OF COAL RESERVES.
IT IS HIGH QUALITY COAL. YOU CAN MAKE COKE OUT OF IT.
IF YOU MINE 200 BILLION METRIC TONS PER YEAR, YOU
WOULD NOT USE UP SHANXI'S RESOURCES IN ONE HUNDRED
YEARS. AND THIS IS ONLY THE COAL FROM 500 METERS
DEEP AND ABOVE. HOWEVER, WE HAVE SERIOUS TRANSPORTATION PROBLEMS. THERE IS ONLY ONE RAILROAD IN THE
AREA. SHANXI PROVINCE PLANS TO BUILD ELECTRICAL
POWER STATIONS TO SEND OUT ELECTRICITY INSTEAD OF
COAL. THIS IS MORE ECONOMICAL. WE ARE ALSO
CONSTRUCTING FACTORIES TO MAKE COAL INTO GAS AND
TRANSMIT IT IN PIPELINES MORE ECONOMICALLY.
NOW WE HAVE ONLY A SINGLE RAILROAD TRACK. WE CAN
MAKE IT A DOUBLE TRACK AND INCREASE RAILROAD VOLUME
BY 100 PERCENT. WE HAVE WORKED OUT THESE PLANS AND
WE ARE STRIVING TO IMPLEMENT THEM. AFTER WE HAVE
MET OUR NEEDS, WE CAN EXPORT THE SURPLUS.

YEAR WE PRODUCED ONE HUNDRED MILLION TONS OF CRUDE
OIL, BUT WE EXPORTED ONLY TEN MILLION TONS. WE ARE

LONG AGO SOME AMERICAN FRIENDS OFFERED TO HELP EXTRACT
THE OIL. SEVEN U.S. COMPANIES WANT TO HELP EXPLORE
AND EXCAVATE THE OIL. SO MUCH FOR THE GENERAL PLAN.
REGARDING THE DEVELOPMENT OF CHINA'S ECOOMY,
WE ARE CONSTRUCTING ENTERPRISES. SOME OF THEM ARE
OPERATING AT A LOSS. WE HAVE MAINLY ACHIEVED ECONOMIC
OUTPUT TO CAPACITY IN THE LAST TWO YEARS. WE HAVE TO
CHANGE MANAGERIAL AND TECHNOLOGICAL LEVELS. WE HAVE
THE PHRASE: &quot;RECONSTRUCTION, READJUSTMENT,
CONSOLIDATION, AND IMPROVEMENT.&quot; THE EMPHASIS IS
ON THE FIRST THREE WORDS. AFTER WE MEET THESE THREE
REQUIREMENTS, IMPROVEMENT CAN BE ACHIEVED. YOU WILL
HAVE BEEN TO SHANGHAI. SHANGHAI IS GOING ABOUT THIS
TASK. THEY HAVE DONE A BETTER JOB IN TEXTILES. WE
HAVE ALSO CARRIED OUT REORGANIZATION IN FACTORIES,

DISCOVERED A SHORTAGE IN ELECTRICITY, ESPECIALLY IF

WE CONSTRUCT TOO MANY FACTORIES.
TALKING ABOUT READJUSTMENT, WE HAVE ALSO
PRODUCED SOME OIL. YEARS AGO, WE DIDN'T EXPORT IT,
HOWEVER. SOME FACTORIES CONVERTED FROM COAL USE TO
OIL USE. THESE FACTORIES ARE BEING RECONVERTED TO
COAL. WE NOW SAVE OIL FOR EXPORT TO EARN FOREIGN
EXCHANGE. SO MUCH FOR THE GENERAL PLAN. YOU CAN
CONCENTRATE ON THE STATISTICS ANNOUNCED AT THE
SECOND SESSION OF THE FIFTH NATIONAL PEOPLE'S CONGRESS.
I DON'T WANT TO REPEAT THESE NOW.
THERE IS ONE EXAMPLE IN SHAGHAI. THE FISHERMEN
USE ZHOU SHAN ISLAND AS A BASE. THERE ARE A LOT
OF JUNKS THERE BUT NOT MANY MOTORBOATS. IT TAKES
SEVERAL DAYS TO REACH THE FISHING GROUNDS. IT IS
NOT AN EASY TASK. WATER AND FOOD SUPPLIES OFTEN
RUN SHORT, FISH PRODUCTION USED TO BE 3,000 TONS
A DAY, BUT SOME OF THE FISH WOULD SPOIL BY THE TIME
THE BOATS RETURNED. WE HAVE NOW CONSTRUCTED
REFRIGERATED SHIPS. THE FISHERMEN GET FRESH WATER
AND FOOD FROM THE SHIP. THE SHIP IN TURN TAKES THE
FISH FROM THE BOATS. PRODUCTION HAS INCREASED BY
100 PERCENT. NOW, TOTAL PRODUCTION IS 6,000 TONS
A DAY. THIS METHOD ILLUSTRATES THE PROBLEM OF
MANAGEMENT AND TECHNOOOGY. IF WE MAKE THIS KIND
OF REORGANIZATION WE CAN DOUBLE OUR PRODUCTION. SO
NOW DIFFERENT FACTORIES ARE THINKING OF WAYS TO
INCREASE PRODUCTION.
I HAVE TALKED ABOUT CONSTRUCTION AND THE FOUR
MODERNIZATIONS. AFTER THE THIRD PLENUM OF THE
ELEVENTH CENTRAL COMMITTEE AND THE SECOND SESSION
OF THE FIFTH NATIONAL PEOPLE'S CONGRESS, WE HAVE

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014

PAGE 03

BEIJIN 05273 03 OF 07 111750Z

HAVE ALSO SET SOME GOALS. WE HAVE A LOT TO DO
INCLUDING ESTABLISHING LAWS. IN THE PAST THE GANG
OF OUR ROTTED PEOPLE'S MINDS AND THEY DID NOT ABIDE
BY LAWS. IT IS NECESSARY TO MAKE LAWS TO ACHIEVE
STABILITY, UNITY AND TRANQUILITY. IN THE
CONSTITUTION WE STIPULATED THE RIGHT TO STRIKE,
TO EXPRESS OPINIONS, TO PUT UP WALL POSTERS, TO
DEBATE. BUT THE ABSENCE OF LAWS MADE IT DIFFICULT
TO GUARANTEE THE BASIC RIGHTS OF THE CONSTITUTION.
LAST YEAR WE HAD DEMOCRACY WALL. THERE WERE SOME
DEMONSTRATIONS AND THESE WERE GUARANTEED BY LAW.
BUT SOME PEOPLE SMASHED SHOPS AND WENT BEYOND THE
LAW. THE GANG OF FOUR WANTED TO USURP STTE AND
PARTY POWER. WE OVERTHREW AND SMASHED THE GANG OF
FOUR. BUT THE INFLUENCE OF THE GANG OF FOUR IS
STILL PRESENT THREE YEARS LATER. AS THE CHINESE
SAYING GOES, THE PERNICIOUS INFLUENCE OF THE BANG
OF FOUR COULD AGAIN RAISE ITS UGLY HEAD. WHO KNOWS
IF THEY COULD COME BACK TO POWER SOME DAY. THE
LAWS AND REGULATIONS WILL BE IMPLEMENTED ON JANUARY 1,
1980. WE ARE NOW ALLOWING THE PEOPLE TO STUDY AND
UNDERSTAND THE LAW. THERE WILL BE TIME IN SHANGHAI,
PLUS SOME OTHER CITIES, FOR YOU TO SEE WHAT HAS BEEN
DONE. YOU WILL SEE WITH YOUR OWN EYES. YOU CAN GET
CLOSE TO THE PEOPLE, BUT UNFORTUNATELY NOT MANY
HAVE MASTERED ENGLISH (LAUFHTER).

SOME PEOPLE MAY ASK WHETHER CHINA IS DEPARTING
FROM CHAIRMAN MAO'S LINE IN PURSUING THE FOUR
MODERNIZATIONS. THIS IS NOT TRUE, SINCE THE LATE
CHAIRMAN MAO ATTENDED THE TENTH PARTY CONGRESS IN
1973 WHEN THE FOUR MODERNIZATIONS GOAL WAS
LAID OUT. PREMIER CHOU ALSO LAID THEM OUT IN HIS
REPORT ON GOVERNMENT WORK. THE GANG OF FOUR OPPOSED
AND NEGATED THE FOUR MODERNIZATIONS. WE HAVE TO
TELL PEOPLE THAT THE NEEDS OF THE MASSES MUST BE
PROVIDED FOR. WE HAVE A SOCIALIST COUNTRY. IF WE
DON'T RAISE LIVING STANDARDS, THEN WE CANNOT SHOW
THAT OUR SYSTEM IS SUPERIOR. WE HAVE TO INCREASE
PRODUCTION BECAUSE MONEY CANNOT DROP FROM THE SKY
(LAUFHTER). AFTER VICTORY IN 1949, CHAIRMAN MAO
STIPULATED THE LINE OF INDEPENDENCE IN POLITICS AND
SELF-RELIANCE IN ECONOMY. AT THE SAME TIME,
FOREIGN SUPPORT SHOULD ALSO BE SOUGHT WITH THE
EMPHASIS ON SELF-RELIANCE. FOR SOME TIME, FOREIGN
SUPPORT FOR ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT WAS NOT POSSIBIEL.
THE GANG OF FOUR OPPOSED IT. THEY SAID, RELIANCE
ON FOREIGN SUPPORT WAS A DISGRACE. TO SUM UP THE
EXPERIENCE OF THE LAST THIRTY YEARS, WE NOT ONLY
SEEK POLITICAL INDEPENDENCE AND SELF-RELIANCE, WE

CAME TO US. THE SOVIET UNION DID NOT AGREE WITH THE
PROPOSAL FOR THE PARIS NEGOTIATIONS. WE URGED VIETNAM
TO JOIN THE PARIS NEGOTIATIONS. WE WELCOMED YOUR
PRESIDENT NIXON TO CHINA IN 1972. AT THE TIME HE TOLD
US THE UNITED STATES HAD COMMITTED A MISTAKE IN ITS
STRATEGY. THE U.S. WAS SUFFERING IN AFRICA AND EUROPE.
IN ORDER TO STRENGTHEN THE U.S. POSITION IN AFRICA AND
EUROPE, WE URGED AND ENCOURAGED VIETNAM TO HAVE NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE UNITED STATES. BECAUSE VIETNAM WAS
CLOSE TO US AND YOUR ARMY WANTED TO GO TO EUROPE TO
FACE THE SOVIETS, WE AGREED WITH YOUR STRATEGY. WE
FELT AT EASE AFTER YOU WITHDREW FROM VIETNAM. BUT
THINGS ALWAS CHANGE. THEN THE VIETNAMESE LEANED ON
THE SOVIET UNION.

VIETNAME DID NOT PURSUE INTERNATIONAL SUPPORT. THIS
WAS WRONG. THIS WAS DUE TO THE FACT THAT VIETNAM
HARBORED GREAT AMBITIONS. IT HAD WILD AMBITIONS.
IT WANTED TO RIG UP THE INDOCHINA FEDERATION AND
SWALLOW KAMPUCHEA. IT OCCUPIED THE XISHA ANDNANSHA

GUANGXI AND SOME OF THAILAND'S TERRITORY. WE DISCOVERED THEIR WILD AMBITIONS AND WARNED THEM, BUT THE
SOVIETS SUPPORTED THEM. THE SOVIET UNION SUPPORTED
THEM FOR THEIR OWN MEGEMONISTIC DESIGN. IT BECAME THE
CUBA OF ASIA. IT CAUSED GREAT HAVOC IN SOUTHEAST
ASIA AND THE PACIFIC REGION, PLUS IT MENACED CHINA'S

ATTACKED OUR BORDER AREA SOME 3,000 TIMES, INVOLVING
UP TO 200-300 CHINESE EACH TIME. THE VIETNAMESE
SMASHED AND BURNED HOUSES. THEY ALSO KILLED THE

BARBARA ROSE COLLINS: MR. VICE PREMIER, SPEAKING OF
THE LAWS, I MISSED TWO: STRIKE AND SPEECH. IF WORKERS
STRIKE, WHAT ARE THEY STRIKING FOR AND DID THEY ACCOMPLISH THEIR GOALS?
GENG: YES, WE HAVE HAD STRIKES IN THE PAST. STRIKES
HELD TO PROTEST MISTAKES COMMITTED BY THE LEADERS IN
CERTAIN ENTERPRISES.
CHRISTOPHER BOND: WE HAVE WATCHED WITH GREAT ENTHUSIASM THE IMPROVEMENT IN RELATIONS BETWEEN CHINA AND
THE UNITED STATES. SOME IN THE U.S. ARE CONCERNED
ABOUT THE WITHDRAWAL OF RECOGNITITION AND THE CUTTING
OFF OF ARMS SALES, ETC., TO TAIWAN. WON'T THIS INVITE
THE INTERVENTION IN TAIWAN BY THE HEGEMONISTIC INTERESTS IN THE SOVIET UNION?
GENG: IT IS IMPOSSIBLE. REST ASSURED THAT THE SOVIET
UNION CANNOT ENTER TAIWAN. THE SOVIET UNION WOULD
EXPOSE ITSELF MORE NAKEDLY IN FRONT OF THE WORLD.
ROBERT S. CARTER: I WOULD LIKE A BRIEF DISCUSSION
ABOUT THE CONDITIONS IN TIBET. WHAT ARE THE PROSPECTS

FOR THE RETURN OF THE DALAI LAMA?
GENG: WE ARE NOT SURE IF HE IS COMING BACK. HE HAS
SPREAD THE WORD THAT HE IS COMING BACK, WE SAY HE IS
WELCOME TO VISIT AND HE CAN LEAVE WHEN HE WANTS. HE
IS ANXIOUS TO BE KING OF TIBET AND THAT CANNOT BE
ACHIEVED (LAUGHTER). TIBET HAS ALWAYS BEEN A PART
OF CHINA. IN THE PAST TIBET WAS A SLAVE-OWNING SOCIETY;
IT WAS A SERF SOCIETY. NOW IT IS SOCIALIST. NEXT TIME,
IF YOU WANT TO GO, YOU CAN GO TO TIBET. IN INVITE YOU
TO GO TO TIBET. YOU CAN SEE HOW HAPPY THE EX-SLAVES ARE.
ROBB: THANK YOU, WE ACCEPT YOUR INVITATION.
PETER MC PHERSON: I WOULD LIKE TO RAISE A QUESTION
ABOUT EXPANDING THE JOINT EFFORTS WE MIGHT MAKE. CAN
WE EXPAND THE EFFORRTS WE MIGHT MAKE TO ACCOMPLISH THE
MUTUAL EXPLOITATION OF COAL?
GENG: WE CAN CARRY OUT COOPERATION IN ALL FIELDS.
THERE ARE BROAD VISTAS IF THE UNITED STATES IS WILLING.
MC PHERSON: WE CAN USE COAL FOR OTHER PURPOSES. THIS
WOULD COST BILLIONS IN RESEARCH. I WANT TO ASK IF
WE CAN WORK TOGETHER?
GENG: IT CAN BE CONSIDERED. WE HAVE A BROAD ROAD IN
FRONT OF US IN ECONOHRC COOPERATION. WHEN YOU WANT TO
COOPERATE, YOU CAN COME WITH THE MONEY,COOPERATION,
TECHNOLOGY AND EQUIPMENT. BUT YOU CAN GET A PROFIT.
THIS IS OUR TUITION. BUT NOT TOO BIG OF A PROFIT.

PROPOSED TRI-PARTITE TALKS. HAVE CHINA AND NORTH
KOREA DISCUSSED THIS AS A WAY OF REDUCING TENSION ON
THE KOREAN PENINSULA?
GENG: CHINA WITHDREW ITS TROOPS FROM KOREA LONG AGO.
IT IS A MATTER BETWEEN YOU THREE. IF NORTH AND SOUTH
KOREA HAVE NO OBJECTION, NEITHER DO WE. THE FUNDEMANETAL
OBSTACLE IS U.S. TROOPS IN SOUTH KOREA. FRANKLY, IF
U.S. TROOPS WERE WITHDRAWN, IT WOULD BE EASIER TO HAVE
NEGOTIATIONS OF COURSE, SOUTH KOREA SAYS THAT IT IS
FACING AN ATTACK FROM THE NORTH SO THE U.S. TROOPS

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
SHOULD STAY. OUR VIEW IS JUST THE OPPOSITE. SOUTH
KOREA IS MUCH LARGER THAN THE NORTH IN POPULATION; IT
HAS A BIGGER ARMY NORTH KOREA WILL NOT INVADE SOUTH
KOREA. U.S. TROOPS ARE STATIONED IN SOUTH KOREA AND
NORTH KOREA IS AFRAID OF AN ATTACK FROM THE SOUTH.

QUESTION: DOES THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA
PLAN TO MODIFY ITS POSITION REGARDING THE MULTILATERAL
NONPROLIFERATION TREATY? WHAT IS ITS POSITION ON
NUCLEAR TESTING?
GENG: WE DIDN'T SIGN IT.
QUESTION: WILL YOU RECONSIDER?
GENG: WE WILL NOT JOINT. THE REASON WE ARE NOT JOINING
OR SIGNING IS THAT WE OPPOSE THE MONOPOLY OF NUCLEAR
ENERGY BY THE UNITED STATES AND THE SOVIET UNION. WE
HAVE ALSO MANUFACTURED SOME NUCLEAR WEAPONS BUT WE
DIDN'T PROLIFERATE THEM. THE PURPOSE IS TO BREAK THE
MONOPOLY. EVERY TIME WE TEST NUCLEAR WEAPONS, WE
ANNOUNCE THAT WE WILL NEVER USE THEM FIRST NOR
PROLIFERATE THEM.
FAITH WHITTELSY: WHAT IS YOUR VIEW OF SALT II?
GENG: YOU HAVE HAD TWO TALKS ON ARMS CONTROL BUT THE
MORE YOU TALK, THE MORE WEAPONS ARE MANUFACTURED.
THE SECOND TIME AROUND, WE FIND YOU HAVE MORE THAN THE

FIRST TIME. THE LIMIT WAS BROKEN AND THE TWO TREATIES
ARE NOT BINDING TO EITHER SIDE. ONE SIDE DOESN'T KNOW
THAT THE OTHER SIDE IS CONTINUING TO PRODUCE WEAPONS.
WE SUPPORT THOROUGH DISARMAMENT BY THE PARTICIPATION OF ALL
THE COUNTRIES OF THE WORLD. THE U.S. AND THE SOVIET
UNION DO NOT AGREE.
JOSEPH GRANDMAISON: MR. ICE PREMIER, ONE IS IMPRESSED
BY THE REALISTIC REEXAMINATION OF YOUR INTERNAL
ECONOMIC PROBLEMS. IF YOU RAISE MILITARY POWER, DO
YOU FEEL CHINA HAS THE ABILITY TO DEFEND ITSELF AGAINST
SOVIET INTRUSION? BOTH CONVENTIONAL AND NUCLEAR?
GENG: IF WE HAVE POSITIONAL WARFARE, WE WILL NOT WIN
THE WAR. BUT IF THE SOVIET UNION WANTS TO LAUNCH A
SURPRISE ATTACK, IT CANNOT WIN. THE ONLY WAR IS A
PROTRACTED WAR. WE CAN DIG TUNNELS, WE HAVE A BIG
MILITIA AND THERE ARE OTHER WAYS TO RESIST.
LOCKYER: I WOULD LIKE TO ASK A QUESTION ABOUT GLOBAL
STRATEGY. DO YOU CONSIDER U.S. GLOBAL STRATEGY WEAK IN
ANY WAY?
GENG: IT IS A GOOD QUESTION. I HAVE THE SAME VIEW
THAT THE U.S. IS SOFT ON A NUMBER OF QUESTIONS WE
CAN CARRY OUT A SMALL ATTACK ON THE LITTLE HEGEMONISTS CLOSE AT HOME. AT LEAST THE UNITED STATES CAN
DO SOMETHING ABOUT CUBA.
BOND: WE I THE U.S. ARE INTERESTED IN SOURCES OF
ENERGY. IF WE DO AWAY WITH BARRIERS IN THE U.S., ARE
THERE OTHER WAYS OR BARRIERS TO OVERCOME TO PARTICIPATE
IN COOPERATION IN ENERGY WITH THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF

UNDERGROUND. OUR FUTURE IS RIPE. WE BELIEVE THE UMS.

THE HIGH SEAS. WE TRUST YOU IN ECONOMIC COOPERATION.
