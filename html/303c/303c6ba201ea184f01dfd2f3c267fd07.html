		<h3>Tor</h3>
		<p><a href="https://www.torproject.org">Tor</a> is an encrypted anonymising network that makes it harder to intercept internet communications, or see where communications are coming from or going to.</p>
		<p>In order to use the WikiLeaks public submission system as detailed above you can download the Tor Browser Bundle, which is a Firefox-like browser available for Windows, Mac OS X and GNU/Linux and pre-configured to connect using the anonymising system Tor.</p>
		<h4>Tails</h4>
		<p>If you are at high risk and you have the capacity to do so, you can also access the submission system through a secure operating system called <a href="https://tails.boum.org">Tails</a>. Tails is an operating system launched from a USB stick or a DVD that aim to leaves no traces when the computer is shut down after use and automatically routes your internet traffic through Tor. Tails will require you to have either a USB stick or a DVD at least 4GB big and a laptop or desktop computer.</p>

		<h3>Tips</h3>
		<p>Our submission system works hard to preserve your anonymity, but we recommend you also take some of your own precautions. Please review these basic guidelines. </p>
		<div>
			<h4>1. Contact us if you have specific problems</h4>
			<p>If you have a very large submission, or a submission with a complex format, or are a high-risk source, please <a href="#submit_help_contact">contact us</a>. In our experience it is always possible to find a custom solution for even the most seemingly difficult situations.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h4>2. What computer to use</h4>
			<p>If the computer you are uploading from could subsequently be audited in an investigation, consider using a computer that is not easily tied to you. Technical users can also use <a href="https://tails.boum.org">Tails</a> to help ensure you do not leave any records of your submission on the computer.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h4>3. Do not talk about your submission to others</h4>
			<p>If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in source protection – it is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This includes other media organisations.</p>
		</div>

	</div>

		<h3>After</h3>

		<div>
			<h4>1. Do not talk about your submission to others</h4>
			<p>If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in source protection – it is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This includes other media organisations.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h4>2. Act normal</h4>
			<p>If you are a high-risk source, avoid saying anything or doing anything after submitting which might promote suspicion. In particular, you should try to stick to your normal routine and behaviour.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h4>3. Remove traces of your submission</h4>
			<p>If you are a high-risk source and the computer you prepared your submission on, or uploaded it from, could subsequently be audited in an investigation, we recommend that you format and dispose of the computer hard drive and any other storage media you used.</p>
			<p>In particular, hard drives retain data after formatting which may be visible to a digital forensics team and flash media (USB sticks, memory cards and SSD drives) retain data even after a secure erasure. If you used flash media to store sensitive data, it is important to destroy the media.</p>
			<p>If you do this and are a high-risk source you should make sure there are no traces of the clean-up, since such traces themselves may draw suspicion.</p>
			<div>
				<h4>4. If you face legal action</h4>
				<p>If a legal action is brought against you as a result of your submission, there are organisations that may help you. The Courage Foundation is an international organisation dedicated to the protection of journalistic sources. You can find more details at <a href="https://www.couragefound.org">https://www.couragefound.org</a>.</p>

		<p>WikiLeaks publishes documents of political or historical importance that are censored or otherwise suppressed. We specialise in strategic global publishing and large archives.</p>
		<p>The following is the address of our secure site where you can anonymously upload your documents to WikiLeaks editors. You can only access this submissions system through Tor. (See our <a href="#submit_help_tor">Tor tab</a> for more information.) We also advise you to read our <a href="#submit_help_tips">tips for sources</a> before submitting.</p>

			<!--<div>
				Copy this address into your Tor browser. Advanced users, if they wish, can also add a further layer of encryption to their submission using <a href="#submit_wlkey">our public PGP key</a>.
			</div>-->
		</div>

		<p>If you cannot use Tor, or your submission is very large, or you have specific requirements, WikiLeaks provides several alternative methods. <a href="#submit_help_contact">Contact us</a> to discuss how to proceed.</p>

THIS IS OUR FIRST VISIT TO CHINA AND WE WERE DELIGHTED TO VISIT
THE GREAT WALL.

ANY OF YOU HAVE BEEN TO CHINA BEFORE.

WAS HERE IN PEKING IN 1945 RIGHT AFTER THE WAR ENDED.

LI: THAT IS UNDER CHENNAULT?

CURTIS: WE ARRIVED LAST MONDAY, HAD A DELIGHTFUL STAY IN
SHANGHAI, TOOK THE TRAIN TO NANKING, ENJOYED OUR STAY THERE OF
TWO NIGHTS AND THEN HAD A VERY PLEASANT TRAIN RIDE HERE. WE HAVE
BEEN TREATED WONDERFULLY.

LI: SO YOU ARRIVED THE 8TH OF NOVEMBER. IN SHANGHAI DID YOU
READ THE BIG CHARACTER POSTERS?

CURTIS: WE COULDN'T READ THEM OURSELVES, BUT OUR GUIDES TOLD US
ABOUT SOME OF THEM.

LI: YOU HAVE ARRIVED IN CHINA AT A TIME THAT THE CENTRAL
COMMITTEE HAS MADE THE DECISION TO APPOINT HUA KUO-FENG AS
CHAIRMAN OF THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE AND OF THE MILITARY COMMISSION
OF THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE. IT IS ALSO AT THE TIME THAT WE HAVE
EXPLAINED THE SCHEMES OF THE GANG OF FOUR -- WANG HUNG-WEN, CHANG
CHUN-CHIAO, CHIANG CHING, AND YAO WEN-YUAN. THE DECISION WAS MADE IN
OCTOBER. THUS, YOU MUST HAVE
SEEM MANY BIG CHARACTER POSTERS IN SHANGHAI.

CURTIS: YES, WE DID.

LI: THAT WAS A MAJOR EVENT IN CHINA. THIS YEAR FIRST PREMIER
CHOU EN-LAI PASSED AWAY, THEN CHU TEH, THE CHAIRMAN OF THE NATIONAL
PEOPLE'S CONGRESS, AND THEN OUR GREAT LEADER AND TEACHER CHAIRMAN
MAO TSE-TUNG.

CURTIS: WE FOLLOW ALL THE NEWS WE GET FROM CHINA BECAUSE WE VALUE THE
FRIENDSHIP OF YOUR GREAT COUNTRY. WE WISH TO EXPRESS OUR CONDOLENCES
ON THE LOSS OF YOUR LEADERS, PARTICULARLY CHAIRMAN MAO. ALSO, WE
BRING GREETINGS TO YOU FROM PRESIDENT FORD.

LI: THANK YOU. WHEN PRESIDENT FORD VISITED CHINA LAST YEAR,
I MET HIM. PLEASE CONVEY MY GREETINGS TO HIM.

CURTIS: THANK YOU, I WILL DO SO. A FEW DAYS BEFORE I LEFT THE U.S.
I HAD A CALL FROM FORMER PRESIDENT NIXON AND HE ASKED THAT I CONVEY
HIS GREETINGS TO CHINA AND THE CHINESE PEOPLE.

LI: PLEASE CONVEY MY THANKS TO MR. NIXON.

CURTIS: YOU'LL BE PLEASED TO KNOW THAT WHEN THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF
OUR VISIT WAS MADE, ALL OF US EXPERIENCED A TREMDNDOUS RESPONSE
FROM OUR PEOPLE WHO EXPRESSED A GREAT INTEREST IN CHINA. MY

NEBRASKA CONSTITUENTS WERE DELIGHTED THAT WE WERE MAKING THIS TRIP.

LI: YOUR STATE HAS A HIGHLY DEVELOPED AGRICULTURE.

CURTIS: YES, WE ARE A GREAT AGRICULTURAL STATE. A NUMBER OF
THE SENATORS HERE REPRESENT AGRICULTURAL STATES AND WE HAVE BEEN
TREMENDOUSLY IMPRESSED BY THE INDUSTRIOUSNESS OF YOUR AGRICULTURAL
WORKERS.

LI: SENATOR YOUNG, YOU ARE ALSO FROM AN AGRICULTURAL STATE, I
BELIEVE.

YOUNG: I'M A FARMER MYSELF AND MY THREE SONS FARM. ONE OF THE
AMAZING THINGS TO ME IS THAT YOUR LAND HAS BEEN PRODUCING FOR
2,000 YEARS OR MORE AND PRODUCES JUST AS WELL AS OURS WHICH HAS
BEEN PRODUCING FOR ONLY A LITTLE OVER ONE HUNDRED YEARS.

LI: IN THE PAST 2,000 YEARS OR MORE WE WERE UNDER FEUDAL RULE
AND PRODUCTION WAS RESTRAINED. AFTERWARDS, THERE WAS AGGRESSION
BY FOREIGN IMPERIALIST STATES SO OUR AGRICULTURE DID NOT DEVELOP.
BEFORE LIBERATION (IN 1949) PRODUCTION WAS BACKWARD IN CHINA
AND NOT ONLY DRAFT ANIMALS BUT ALSO HUMAN BEINGS HAD TO
PULL PLOWS. THERE WAS THE RUTHLESS PLUNDER BY LANDLORDS
AND BUREAUTCRATIC-CAPITALISTS, AS WELL AS BY IMPERIALISTS. SO
PEASANTS
AT THAT TIME WERE IN A DIRE PLIGHT. IT WAS NOT SURPRISING THAT
SEVERAL MILLION PEASANTS STARVED TO DEATH. THAT WAS THE
SITUATION DURING THE FEUDAL DYNASTIES AND UNDER CHIANG KAI-SHEK
RULE. YOU MIGHT VERY WELL STUDY WHY CHIANG KAI-SHEK FELL,
THERE MUST BE SOME REASONS BEHIND IT. IT WAS BECAUSE HE
OFFENDED THE MAJORITY OF THE PEOPLE, ABOVE ALL HE OFFENDED THE
PEASANTS AND WORKERS. NOW IN CHINA, WITH SUCH A VAST TERRITORY
AND 800 MILLION PEOPLE, WE HAVE SOLVED THE FOOD PROBLEM IN THE
MAIN, SO PEOPLE WON'T STARVE TO DEATH OR DIE OF COLD. THIS WAS
THE GREAT ACHIEVEMENT MADE UNDER THE LEADERSHIP OF CHAIRMAN MAO
AND BY RELYING ON THE EFFORTS OF THE BROAD MASSES OF PEOPLE.
BUT WE ARE NOT SATISFIED. JUST NOW I SAID WE HAD SOLVED
THE FOOD PROBLEM IN THE MAIN. IT IS NOT YET COMPLETELY SOLVED AND
WE MUST CONTINUE OUR EFFORTS. WE JUST HAVE SUFFICIENT FOOD GRAIN
TO FEED OUR PEOPLE. WE HAVE SOME TO EXPORT BUT WE ALSO IMPORT
SOME. THE AMOUNT IS LIMITED COMPARED TO YOURS. WE EXPORT

RELY ON OUR OWN EFFORTS AND RUN EVERYTHING WITH OUR OWN STRENGTH.

CURTIS: I WISH TO COMEND YOU ON YOUR GREAT PROGRESS, AND ON
YOUR DETERMINATION TO BE SELF-SUFFICIENT IN FOOD. YOU HAVE DONE A
GREAT JOB. I UNDERSTAND YOUR EXPORTS INCLUDE SOME RICE. IS THAT
RIGHT?

LI: WE EXPORT SOME RICE AND SOY BEANS.

CURTIS: WHAT DO YOU IMPORT?

YOUR COUNTRY.

SELF-SUFFICIENT IN FOOD GRAIN, IF YOU HAVE TO BUY ANY, PLEASE
COME TO US. SENATOR YOUNG IS A WHEAT FARMER AND SO IS

CURTIS: THEN WE MUST BUY SOMETHING FROM YOU. DO YOU HAVE SOME
OIL TO SELL US?

LI: WE ARE JUST SELF-SUFFICIENT IN OIL. OUR SURPLUS IS
NOT MUCH. OF COURSE WE HAVE BIG OIL DEPOSITS.

CURTIS: WE UNDERSTAND THE POTENTIAL IS VERY GREAT.

LI: YES, YOU'RE RIGHT. FURTHER EFFORTS SHOULD BE MADE FOR
EXPLORATION. OUR OIL INDUSTRY IS STILL VERY YOUNG AND IN THE
PAST WE HAD VERY LITTLE. IN 1960 WE BEGAN TO HAVE OUR OWN OIL
INDUSTRY. BUT WE HAD TO IMPORT OIL FROM OTHERS, ESPECIALLY
FROM OUR NEIGHBOR TO THE NORTH WHO TRIED TO STRANGLE US.
PERHAPS YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN BY OUR NEIGHBOR TO THE NORTH. WE'VE HAD
BAD RELATIONS.

CURTIS: WE DON'T THINK THEY'RE VERY NEIGHBORLY.

LI: THEY SEEK HEGEMONY.

CURTIS: THE MAJOR REASON THE U.S. SPENDS SO MUCH TO STAY STRONG
MILITARILY IS THAT WE FEEL THAT WILL RETARD ANY CHANCE THAT THE SOVIET

UNION WILL TRY AGGRESSION.

LI: THE SOVIETS HAVE BIG AMBITIONS, AND WOULD LIKE TO HAVE THE
WHOLE GLOBE. BUT THEY ARE UNABLE TO ACHIEVE THAT BECAUSE
THEIR STRENGTH IS NOT THAT GREAT. POLITICALLY, THEY SEEK HEGEMONY
NO MATTER WHAT TRICKS OR FINE WORDS THEY USE, THEY WILL EVENTUALLY
BE EXPOSED BY THE PEOPLE OF THE WORLD. THEIR SEEKING HEGEMONY
MAKES THEM THE ENEMY OF THE WORLD'S PEOPLE. AT HOME THERE IS
LOPSIDED DEVELOPMENT IN THE SOVIET ECONOMY, THERE IS NOT ENOUGH
FOOD TO EAT, NOT ENOUGH FOOD GRAINS. SOME PEOPLE SATIRIZE THE
SOVIET UNION BY SAYING THE SOVIETS SOW SEEDS IN
THE UKRAINE AND HARVEST CROPS IN THE US.
THEIR TOP PRIORITY IS THE DEVELOPMENT OF NATIONAL DEFENSE AND IN
DOMESTIC POLICIES THE SOVIET UNION OPPRESSES THE MINORITY NATIONAL-
ITIES AND PRACTICES FASCIST RULE. ACTUALLY THEY ARE VERY
FEEBLE.

CURTIS: YOU HAVE HAD A LONG AND DISTINGUISHED CAREER AND YOU
ARE A STUDENT OF ECONOMICS. WHY IN YOUR OPINION IS THE SOVIET
ECONOMY WEAK?

LI: I'M NO STUDENT OF ECONOMICS. I'M NOT A SCHOLAR OF ECONOMICS.
BUT I DID FIGHT IN THE WAR. IN MY VIEW, THE SOVIET UNION HAS
OFFENDED THE WORKERS AND PEASANTS AND BROAD MASSES OF THE PEOPLE,
THEREFORE THERE IS NO ENTHUSIASM ON THEIR PART. IN PLANNING, THEY
GIVE PROMINENCE TO DEVELOPMENT OF NATIONAL DEFENSE. OTHER BRANCHES
OF INDUSTRY -- MACHINE BUILDING, CHEMICALS, ETC, -- ARE LAGGING BE-
HIND. IN RELATIONS BETWEEN INDUSTRY AND AGRICULTURE, THEY
NEGLECT THE DEVELOPMENT OF AGRICULTURE. YOU CAN STUDY WHETHER OR
NOT I'M RIGHT. IN THE SOVIET UNION LINE, PRINCIPLES, AND
POLICIES ARE ALL WRONG. THEY PRACTICE REVISIONISM AND FASCISM,
AND THERE IS NO WAY TO MOBILIZE THE ENTHUSIASM OF THE WORKERS,
PEASANTS AND OTHER PEOPLE.

CURTIS: WE IN THE U.S. ARE VERY AWARE OF THE SOVIET MILITARY
THREAT AND THE GREAT SUMS THEY ARE SPENDING ON ARMAMENTS. THAT IS
WHY WE INTEND TO STAY STRONG, WHY WE MAKE SACRIFICES IN MANY
PARTS OF THE WORLD TO RESIST SOVIET AGGRESSION.

LI: WE ARE ALSO AWARE OF SOVIET MILITARY STRENGTH, BUT THEY
CONFIDENTIAL

TALK OF DISARMAMENT EVERY DAY.

CURTIS: DO YOU THINK THE SOVIETS HAVE PLANS FOR WESTERN EUROPE IF
THEY ARE NOT RESISTED?

LI: WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY PLANS? THE SOVIETS THINK FIRST OF ALL
ABOUT EUROPE.

CURTIS: I MEAN AGGRESSIVE PLANS.

LI: SOME PEOPLE IN THE WORLD TEND TO THINK THAT THE FOCUS
OF SOVIET STRATEGY LIES IN THE EAST. CHAIRMAN MAO THOUGHT THAT
THE SOVIET STRATEGIC FOCUS WAS IN EUROPE, INCLUDING THE MIDDLE
EAST. THIS DOES NOT MEAN WE WILL SLACKEN OUR VIGILANCE. WE ARE
HEIGHTENING OUR VIGILANCE. THAT IS WHY WE DIG TUNNELS DEEP AND
STORE GRAIN EVERYWHERE. BY DIGGING TUNNELS DEEP WE MEAN IF THE
SOVIETS INVADE US WE WILL FIGHT BACK. MAO TAUGHT US TO PREPARE
AGAINST WAR, PREPARE AGAINST NATURAL DISASTERS, AND DO EVERYTHING
FOR THE PEOPLE. BY PREPARING FOR WAR WE MEAN IF THE SOVIETS ATTACK
CHINA, WE CERTAINLY WILL FIGHT BACK. BUT THE FOCUS OF SOVIET
STRATEGY REMAINS IN EUROPE INCLUDING THE MIDDLE EAST. SO WE
SUPPORT A UNITED EUROPE. BUT AT PRESENT THE
EUROPEAN COUNTRIES ARE TOO DIVIDED.

CURTIS: DO YOU SUPPORT THE EFFORTS OF THE UNITED STATES TO
MAKE NATO STRONG?

LI: YOU CAN'T AFFORD TO LEAVE EUROPE, NEITHER CAN EUROPE.

CURTIS: THE US HAS ASSUMED RESPONSIBILITY IN SO MANY PLACES
IN THE WORLD AND WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE THOSE RESPONSIBILITIES. SO
WE WELCOME THE SUPPORT OF THE GREAT PEOPLE OF CHINA IN OPPOSITION
TO SOVIET AGGRESSION.

LI: WE HOPE YOU WILL ESTABLISH AN EQUAL PARTNERSHIP WITH EUROPE
AND ALL OTHER PEOPLES OF THE WORLD.

CURTIS: DO THE SOVIETS HAVE MANY TROOPS ON YOUR BORDERS?

LI: THEY CLAIM TO HAVE STATIONED ABOUT ONE MILLION TROOPS ON THE
BORDER. THE BORDER EXTENDS OVER MANY THOUSANDS OF KILOMETERS. ITS
A LONG FRONT LINE. DO YOU THINK THE ONE MILLION TROOPS ARE
DIRECTED AGAINST CHINA ONLY? I THINK THEY ARE PRIMARILY DIRECTED
AGAINST THE U.S., THEN AGAINST JAPAN, AND OF COURSE ARE ALSO
DIRECTED AGAINST CHINA. ONE MILLION TROOPS IS NOT ENOUGH TO FIGHT
AGAINST CHINA. EVEN IF THEY ADDED ANOTHER ONE MILLION IT WOULD
NOT BE ENOUGH, NOR EVEN TWO MILLION MORE. IF THE SOVIETS COME,
WE'LL YIELD SOME PLACES TO THEM, THEN CLOSE OUR DOOR AND BEAT THE
DOG INSIDE THE ROOM. WHEN THE DOOR IS CLOSED, IT IS EASIER TO
DEAL WITH THE DOG AND TO BEAT THE DOG. THAT WAS THE WAY WE
FOUGHT THE JAPANESE. WE CLOSED THE DOOR AND THOROUGHLY
ANNIHILATED THE JAPANESE. AT THAT TIME, CHINA WAS RULED BY
CHIANG KAI-SHEK AND LARGE TRACTS OF TERRITORY IN THE NORTH AND
CENTRAL CHINA WERE LEFT TO US BECAUSE CHIANG KAI-SHEK RAN AWAY.
CHIANG KAI-SHEK FIRST RAN FROM THE NORTHEAST AND THE JAPANESE
OCCUPIED IT. THEN FROM NORTH, CENTRAL, SOUTH AND EAST CHINA.
CHIANG KAI-SHEK TROOPS WERE RUNNING IN FRONT OF THE JAPANESE AND
OUR TROOPS WERE RUNNING AFTER THE JAPANESE. THEY TURNED THEIR

OF RESISTANCE AGAINST THE JAPANESE, NORTH, CENTRAL, EVEN EAST AND
SOUTH CHINA WAS LED BY THE COMMUNIST PARTY. SO ONE MILLION
SOVIET TROOPS ON THE BORDER WILL BE NO MATCH FOR US.
IN FINAL ANALYSIS, THE FOCUS OF THE SOVIET STRATEGY IS EUROPE.
MY FRIENDS MAY NOT BELIEVE MY WORDS BUT FACTS WILL BEAR ME
OUT. AS FOR THE DISARMAMENT THEY ARE ALWAYS
TALKING ABOUT, WE DON'T BELIEVE IT.

CURTIS: WHAT WOULD BE THE BEST STRATEGY IN EUROPE TO OPPOSE
SOVIET AGGRESSION?

LI: I DON'T KNOW. THE SOVIET UNION WANTS TO SWALLOW UP THAT
PLACE.

CURTIS: ARE YOU MAKING PROGRESS IN YOUR ARMAMENT PROGRAM?

LI: SINCE WE MUST MAKE PREPARATIONS AGAINST WAR, WE MUST MANUFACTURE
SOME THINGS.

CURTIS: YOU HAVE BEEN VERY GRACIOUS IN RECEIVING US. I WOULD LIKE TO
YIELD AT THIS POINT TO THE VICE CHAIRMAN OF OUR DELEGATION,
SENATOR BIRCH BAYH OF THE STATE OF INDIANA. HE MIGHT WISH TO MAKE
SOME COMMENTS OR ASK SOME QUESTIONS.

BAYH: MR. VICE PREMIER. THIS IS MY FIRST TIME IN YOUR COUNTRY.
EARLIER
I SAW IT THROUGH THE EYES OF MY FATHER WHO WAS HERE AT THE TIME WHEN
SENATOR STEVENS WAS HERE, BUT IT'S NOT LIKE SEEING IT MYSELF. MY WIFE
AND I ARE DELIGHTED AND EXTREMELY IMPRESSED BY WHAT WE HAVE SEEN.
IT WOULD BE REMISS OF US NOT TO INDICATE OUR GRATITUDE
TO YOUR VICE FOREIGN MINISTER WHO MET US YESTERDAY, TO OUR HOST
AT THE BANQUET AND TO ALL THOSE, INCLUDING MADAME KANG, WHO HAVE
SHOWN US THE KINDEST HOSPITALITY.

LI: WHAT YEARS WAS YOUR FATHER IN CHINA?

BAYH: 1943-45. I'M A FARMER BASICALLY AS WELL AS A SENATOR. I HAVE
BEEN IMPRESSED BY THE WAY THAT THE GREATEST AMOUNT OF PRODUCTION IS
OBTAINED FROM EACH SQUARE CENTIMETER OF GROUND, BY THE INDUSTRIOUS-

WE CAN THUS REALIZE BETTER THE DEPTH OF THE GRIEF YOUR COUNTRY MUST

BAYH: THIS HAS BEEN A LONG PROLOGUE. I WOULD LIKE TO GET YOUR THOUGHT
S
ON WHAT I THINK OUR WHOLE COUNTRY WOULD LIKE TO KNOW. AS I UNDERSTAND
SOMETIME THIS YEAR YOU WILL PROMULGATE YOUR FIFTH FIVE YEAR PLAN OF
YOUR COUNTRY. ARE THERE ELEMENTS IN THIS PLAN WHICH YOU COULD DISCLOS

-- ALTHOUGH I CAN APPRECIATE YOUR STRONG FEELING OF SELF-RELIANCE --
TRADE OPPORTUNITIES, MACHINERY, FACTORIES, EQUIPMENT AND A LARGE
RANGE OF AREAS WHICH COULD BE PART OF THE
CONTINUING RELATIONSHIP BETEWEN OUR TWO COUNTRIES?

LI: SPEAKING ABOUT OUR PLAN IS COMPLEX AND INVOLVES LOTS OF
ASPECTS. IT IS DIFFICULT TO DISCUSS IN A SYSTEMATIC WAY.
DURING HIS LIFETIME, CHAIRMAN MAO NOT ONLY LAID DOWN THE BASIC
LINE FOR POLICY BUT ALSO THE BASIC LINE AND
PRINCIPLES FOR CONSTRUCTION OF THE COUNTRY. THESE PRINCIPLES WERE
CONFIDENTIAL

CONFIDENTIAL

PAGE 02        PEKING 02368  05 OF 07  161519Z

STATED IN THE REPORT BY THE LATE PREMIER CHOU EN-LAI AT THE FOURTH NP
C.
HE DISCUSSED THE MODERNIZATION OF INDUSTRY, AGRICULTURE, NATIONAL
DEFENSE, AND SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY. IN MAKING ECONOMIC PLANS, WE
MUST FIRST THINK OF THE 800 MILLION PEOPLE AND BEAR
IN MIND THE FOOD, CLOTHING AND HOUSING PROBLEMS OF 800 MILLION PEOPLE
.
SO WE PLAN THE ECONOMY IN THE ORDER OF AGRICULTURE, LIGHT INDUSTRY
AND HEAVY INDUSTRY. THIS WAS CONSISTENT WITH THE TEACHINGS OF CHAIRMA
N
MAO THAT WE MUST FIRST DEVELOP AGRICULTURE. IF WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH
FOOD FOR OUR PEOPLE, EVEN IF WE IMPORT 10 OR 20 MILLION TONS OF GRAIN
,
THIS WOULD NOT SOLVE OUR PROBLEM. IF AGRICULTURE IS DEVELOPED, IT
IS EASIER TO DEVELOP LIGHT INDUSTRY, AND HEAVY INDUSTRY WILL HAVE A
SOLID FOUNDATION. SO WE MAKE OUR PLANS ACCORDING TO THIS PRINCIPLE.
WE HAVE A PLAN BUT IT IS NOT YET FINALIZED. WE HAVE NO INTENTION OF
MAKING IT PUBLIC. THE PLAN HAS NOT YET MATURED AND IS STILL UNDER
DISCUSSION. IN DISCUSSING IT WE MAY FIND NEW PROBLEMS AND REVISE THE
PLAN. AS FOR RELATIONS BETWEEN OUR TWO COUNTRIES, ESPECIALLY
TRADE, IT REMAINS TO BE SEEN. WE HAVE BOUGHT SOME EQUIPMENT FROM THE
US
--SUCH AS CHEMICAL FERTILIZER PLANTS.

BAYH: THE KELLOGG UREA PLANTS.

LI: IT DEPENDS ON WHETHER WE NEED THIS AND ARE ABLE TO DO IT. THE
QUESTION OF NECESSITY IS EASY. BUT IF WE ASK OUR MINISTER, HE WILL
ASK FOR MANY THINGS. AS FOR OUR ABILITY, THAT IS VERY DIFFICULT,
WE DON'T HAVE THE MONEY TO BUY. ON PRINCIPLE WE RELY ON OUR OWN
EFFORTS. MAINLY WE RELY ON OUR OWN EFFORTS. WE DO NOT PLAN TO BE IN
DEBT. WE WERE ONCE IN DEBT TO THE SOVIET UNION. OUR DEBTS TO THE SOVI
ET
UNION WERE INCURRED IN 1950-51 DURING THE WAR OF RESISTANCE AGAINST
THE U.S. AND TO ASSIST KOREA. WE FOUGHT A WAR IN THAT COUNTRY, OUR
TWO COUNTRIES. IT IS NOT PLEASANT TO BE A DEBTOR.

BAYH: IT IS NOT PLEASANT TO BE A CREDITOR OF THE SOVIETS EITHER.

LI: PERHAPS THE SOVIET UNION FINDS IT PLEASANT. THEN WE MADE
OUR MINDS UP TO REPAY ALL DEBTS TO THE SOVIET UNION. AFTER THAT WE
CONFIDENTIAL

CONFIDENTIAL

PAGE 03        PEKING 02368  05 OF 07  161519Z

NEVER INCURRED ANY FOREIGN OR DOMESTIC DEBTS. ONCE WE ISSUED PUBLIC
BONDS BUT WE LATER REPAID THEM. SO AS TO TRADE BETWEEN OUR
TWO COUNTRIES, WE'LL HAVE TO SE. I HAVE JUST SAID THAT IT DEPENDS ON
NECESSITY AND ABILITY. ANOTHER THING IS YOUR HIGH TARRIFF WHICH IS
TROUBLESOME. I THINK IT IS NOT EASY TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM FOR THE
TIME BEING. ROUGHLY THIS IS WHERE WE ARE AT THE PRESENT STAGE. I
THINK WE IMPORT MORE FROM THE U.S. THAN YOU DO FROM US.

BAYH: YOU HAVE BEEN VERY KIND AND I APPRECIATE YOUR RESPONSE.
WHAT I ASKED WAS IN RESPECT TO OUR FUTURE RELATIONS. I THINK THAT TO
THE EXTENT THAT WE CAN INCREASE TRADE OPPORTUNITIES, PERMIT MORE
PEOPLE OF THE US TO VISIT CHINA AND MORE CHINESE TO VISIT THE U.S.
-- THERE HAS BEEN SOME OF THIS BUT IT SHOULD BE INCREASED -- TO
THE EXTENT THAT TRADE AND OTHER OPEN DOOR POLICIES CAN BE PURSUED
THEY WILL HELP TO FIND A SOLUTION. THE GROUP HERE IS GOING BACK
AS AMBASSADORS OF GOODWILL FOR CHINA.

LI: AT PRESENT THERE ARE LOTS OF EXCHANGES ALREADY.

CURTIS: WE FEEL PRIVILEGED AND APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO
CARRY ON THIS CONVERSATION WITH YOU. I WOULD LIKE TO EXTEND TO
MY COLLEAGUES THE OPPORTUNITY TO SAY SOMETHING OR TO ASK QUESTIONS.

YOUNG: FIRST I WOULD LIKE TO SAY THAT I DEEPLY APPRECIATE THE
REAL FRIENDSHIP WHICH WE HAVE RECEIVED WHILE HERE. YOU HAVE OPENED
YOUR DOORS TO US AND SHOWED US REAL FRIENDSHIP. I WOULD LIKE TO SAY
ALSO THAT NO OTHER NATION IN THE WORLD COULD FEED, CLOTHE, EDUCATE,
AND PROVIDE SUCH GOOD CARE OF 800 MILLION PEOPLE. TO DO THIS AND TO
STAY OUT OF DEBT IS SOMETHING. WE COULD LEARN A FEW THINGS FROM YOU A

STAYING OUT OF DEBT. THANK YOU.

HOLLINGS: MR. VICE PREMIER, I APPRECIATE VERY MUCH THE OPPORTUNITY
AND I AM PARTICULARLY HONORED TO HAVE THIS CONVERSATION WITH YOU,
SINCE YOU ARE WELL KNOWN IN THE U.S. AS ONE OF THE LAST OF THE
VETERANS OF THE LONG MARCH AND AS A PARTNER WITH CHAIRMAN MAO
AND PREMIER CHOU IN THE MODERNIZATION OF CHINA.

LI: WE'LL WORK STILL HARDER TO BUILD OUR COUNTRY UNDER THE
LEADERSHIP OF THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE HEADED BY CHAIRMAN HUA, RELYING
ON THE EFFORTS OF THE PROPLE.

HOLLINGS: AS A SENATOR, I MUST POINT OUT THAT I SPEAK INDIVIDUALLY.
WE ARE TOLD THATANYTHING A U.S. SENATOR MAY UTTER IS CONSIDERED
A POSITION OF THE USG. THAT IS NOT TRUE. EACH ONE OF US SPEAKS FOR
HIMSELF. THERE ARE FIVE OTHER SENATORS HERE AND THEY DO NOT
SPEAK FOR ME AND I CANNOT SPEAK FOR THEM. I BELIEVE YOU HAVE AN
INVESTMENT IN THE TIME AND EFFORT IT TOOK TO BRING ME
ALL THE WAY TO CHINA AND I WISH TO SPEAK FRANKLY. SPEAKING FOR
MYSELF,
WE BELIEVE IN THE PRINCIPLES OF THE SHANGHAI COMMUNIQUE AND WE
BELIEVE WE ARE ADHERING TO THE PRINCIPLES, AND AS THE COMMUNIQUE
STATES, AS TENSIONS EASE, WE CAN CONTINUE TO MAKE PROGRESS UNDER THE
SHANGHAI COMMUNIQUE. WE BELIEVE THIS TRIP SO GENEROUSLY PROVIDED TO
CONFIDENTIAL

US HAS HELPED TO EASE TENSIONS AND CERTAINLY HAS ENHANCED MY UNDER-
STANDING AND APPRECIATION OF CHINA. AS SENATOR, I BELIEVE THAT THERE
IS ONE CHINA AND THAT YOU ARE THAT CHINA.

LI: YOU'RE RIGHT.

HOLLINGS: HOWEVER, WE HAVE HAD FRIENDS OF LONG STANDING ON
TAIWAN AND AS A SENATOR, I DON'T BELIEVE THE MAJORITY OF THE
U.S. SENATORS WOULD ABRUPTLY ABANDON THAT FRIENDSHIP. A JOURNEY OF
1,000 MILES, THEY SAY IN CHINA, BEGINS WITH ONE STEP. I THINK WE
SHOULD MAKE STEPS TOGETHER TO TRY TO INCREASE TRADE,
OPEN AIR ROUTES, AND ON OUR SIDE REDUCE TROOPS ON TAIWAN TO
MAKE STEPS TO THE REALIZATION OF THE SHANGHAI COMMUNIQUE
PRINCIPLES. WE IN THE US HAVE NEVER BELIEVED IN HEGEMONY. THE FACT IN
OUR LONG HISTORY IS THAT WE GAVE FREEDOM TO THE PHILIPPINES
AND CUBA.
AFTER WORLD WAR II IN WHICH WE DEFEATED GERMANY, ITALY, AND JAPAN,
WE NOT ONLY GAVE THEM FREEDOM BUT ALSO FINANCED THEIR RECOVERY.

LI: PEOPLE IN THE WORLD BELIEVE YOU STILL HAVE SOME HEGEMONY.

HOLLINGS:
WE ABSOLUTELY REFUTE THAT BY OUR OWN ACTS OVER 200 YEARS
OF HISTORY. WE WISH NOTHING BUT FREEDOM FOR THE PEOPLES AND I THINK
THE U.S. AND CHINA WORKING TOGETHER COULD BRING ABOUT FREEDOM AND
ECONOMIC SUSTENANCE TO THE THIRD WORLD.
I'M SURE THIS VISIT HAS SERVED AS A PLATFORM OR STJATING POINT FOR
ME AS A SENATOR TO UNDERSTAND AND APPRECIATE THE GREATNESS OF CHINA
AND I HOPE SIMILAR VISITS BY YOUR DISTINGUISHED LEADERS TO THE U.S.
WILL FOLLOW.

LI: HOW CAN WE GO TO THE US SINCE THE EMBASSY OF THE TAIWAN CLIQUE IS
THERE?

HOLLINGS: THAT'S ONE OF THE PROBLEMS WE WILL HAVE TO SOLVE
AND WE IN THE SENATE WILL BE WORKING ON THAT PROBLEM.

LI: THE SOLUTION MUST CONFORM TO THE SHANGHAI COMMUNIQUE.

CURTIS: SENATOR STEVENS OF ALASKA.

STEVENS: YES WE ARE. ALASKA IS SOMEWHAT SIMILAR TO YUNNAN PROVINCE
WHERE I WAS STATIONED DURING THE WAR. IT MAY INTEREST YOU TO KNOW
THAT THOSE OF US IN THE AIR FORCE HERE HAD GREAT RES SECT FOR YOUR
PEOPLE IN THE NORTH.MY SQUADRON SUPPLIED YOUR TROOPS AT TIMES. YOU
SPEAK THE TRUTH WHEN YOU SAY YOU REALLY FOUGHT THE JAPANESE. WE
KNEW THAT AND RESPECTED YOU FOR IT. MY LARGE COLLEAGUE FROM THE
SOUTH,
HE SPEAKS CANDIDLY AND WE RESPECT HIS CANDOR. BUT I'D LIKE TO
PURSUE HIS POINT. ISN'T THERE SOME WAY WE COULD START THE FLOW
OF VISITS BOTH WAYS? WE HAVE DIFFICULTIES IN CONGRESS IN BEING
ABLE TO FOLLOW THROUGH ON THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS RELATIONSHIP
BASED ON A LACK OF UNDERSTANDING. YOUR PEOPLE HAVE DOUBLED SINCE I
WAS HERE. YOUR HOUSING AND FOOD PROBLEMS HAVE BEEN SOLVED, BUT THAT
WORD ISN'T GETTING BACK TO THE U.S. WE NEED MORE OF OUR PEOPLE
COMING THIS WAY BUT ALSO MORE OF YOUR PEOPLE COMING TO THE U.S. TO
VISIT
COLLEGES, OUR COUNTIES, OUR CITIES, TO INCREASE FRIENDSHIP AND
UNDERSTANDING. I HAVE BEEN AMAZED BY THE FRIENDSHIP I HAVE FOUND
HERE.
I AM DEEPLY IMPRESSED BY THE SMILES I HAVE SEEN ON THE
STREETS HERE BECAUSE I DIDN'T SEE THAT DURING THE WAR. PERHAPS
PEOPLE DON'T SMILE DURING WARS. BUT THIS IS A TWO WAY STREET, THIS
APPROACH TO NORMALIZATION. SOMEHOW I DON'T SEE MUCH COMING OUR WAY
ON THAT TWO-WAY STREET.

SHANGHAI, TOOK THE TRAIN TO NANKING, ENJOYED OUR STAY THERE OF
TWO NIGHTS AND THEN HAD A VERY PLEASANT TRAIN RIDE HERE. WE HAVE
BEEN TREATED WONDERFULLY.

LI: SO YOU ARRIVED THE 8TH OF NOVEMBER. IN SHANGHAI DID YOU
READ THE BIG CHARACTER POSTERS?

CURTIS: WE COULDN'T READ THEM OURSELVES, BUT OUR GUIDES TOLD US
ABOUT SOME OF THEM.

LI: YOU HAVE ARRIVED IN CHINA AT A TIME THAT THE CENTRAL
COMMITTEE HAS MADE THE DECISION TO APPOINT HUA KUO-FENG AS
CHAIRMAN OF THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE AND OF THE MILITARY COMMISSION
OF THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE. IT IS ALSO AT THE TIME THAT WE HAVE
EXPLAINED THE SCHEMES OF THE GANG OF FOUR -- WANG HUNG-WEN, CHANG
CHUN-CHIAO, CHIANG CHING, AND YAO WEN-YUAN. THE DECISION WAS MADE IN
OCTOBER. THUS, YOU MUST HAVE

I MET HIM. PLEASE CONVEY MY GREETINGS TO HIM.

CURTIS: THANK YOU, I WILL DO SO. A FEW DAYS BEFORE I LEFT THE U.S.
I HAD A CALL FROM FORMER PRESIDENT NIXON AND HE ASKED THAT I CONVEY
HIS GREETINGS TO CHINA AND THE CHINESE PEOPLE.

NEBRASKA CONSTITUENTS WERE DELIGHTED THAT WE WERE MAKING THIS TRIP.

LI: YOUR STATE HAS A HIGHLY DEVELOPED AGRICULTURE.

CURTIS: YES, WE ARE A GREAT AGRICULTURAL STATE. A NUMBER OF
THE SENATORS HERE REPRESENT AGRICULTURAL STATES AND WE HAVE BEEN
TREMENDOUSLY IMPRESSED BY THE INDUSTRIOUSNESS OF YOUR AGRICULTURAL
WORKERS.

LI: SENATOR YOUNG, YOU ARE ALSO FROM AN AGRICULTURAL STATE, I
BELIEVE.

YOUNG: I'M A FARMER MYSELF AND MY THREE SONS FARM. ONE OF THE
AMAZING THINGS TO ME IS THAT YOUR LAND HAS BEEN PRODUCING FOR
2,000 YEARS OR MORE AND PRODUCES JUST AS WELL AS OURS WHICH HAS
BEEN PRODUCING FOR ONLY A LITTLE OVER ONE HUNDRED YEARS.

LI: IN THE PAST 2,000 YEARS OR MORE WE WERE UNDER FEUDAL RULE
AND PRODUCTION WAS RESTRAINED. AFTERWARDS, THERE WAS AGGRESSION
BY FOREIGN IMPERIALIST STATES SO OUR AGRICULTURE DID NOT DEVELOP.
BEFORE LIBERATION (IN 1949) PRODUCTION WAS BACKWARD IN CHINA
AND NOT ONLY DRAFT ANIMALS BUT ALSO HUMAN BEINGS HAD TO
PULL PLOWS. THERE WAS THE RUTHLESS PLUNDER BY LANDLORDS
AND BUREAUTCRATIC-CAPITALISTS, AS WELL AS BY IMPERIALISTS. SO
PEASANTS
AT THAT TIME WERE IN A DIRE PLIGHT. IT WAS NOT SURPRISING THAT
SEVERAL MILLION PEASANTS STARVED TO DEATH. THAT WAS THE
SITUATION DURING THE FEUDAL DYNASTIES AND UNDER CHIANG KAI-SHEK
RULE. YOU MIGHT VERY WELL STUDY WHY CHIANG KAI-SHEK FELL,
THERE MUST BE SOME REASONS BEHIND IT. IT WAS BECAUSE HE
OFFENDED THE MAJORITY OF THE PEOPLE, ABOVE ALL HE OFFENDED THE
PEASANTS AND WORKERS. NOW IN CHINA, WITH SUCH A VAST TERRITORY
AND 800 MILLION PEOPLE, WE HAVE SOLVED THE FOOD PROBLEM IN THE
MAIN, SO PEOPLE WON'T STARVE TO DEATH OR DIE OF COLD. THIS WAS
THE GREAT ACHIEVEMENT MADE UNDER THE LEADERSHIP OF CHAIRMAN MAO
AND BY RELYING ON THE EFFORTS OF THE BROAD MASSES OF PEOPLE.
BUT WE ARE NOT SATISFIED. JUST NOW I SAID WE HAD SOLVED
THE FOOD PROBLEM IN THE MAIN. IT IS NOT YET COMPLETELY SOLVED AND
WE MUST CONTINUE OUR EFFORTS. WE JUST HAVE SUFFICIENT FOOD GRAIN
TO FEED OUR PEOPLE. WE HAVE SOME TO EXPORT BUT WE ALSO IMPORT
SOME. THE AMOUNT IS LIMITED COMPARED TO YOURS. WE EXPORT

ONE OR TWO MILLION TONS AND IMPORT ABOUT THE SAME. WE MUST
RELY ON OUR OWN EFFORTS AND RUN EVERYTHING WITH OUR OWN STRENGTH.

CURTIS: I WISH TO COMEND YOU ON YOUR GREAT PROGRESS, AND ON
YOUR DETERMINATION TO BE SELF-SUFFICIENT IN FOOD. YOU HAVE DONE A
GREAT JOB. I UNDERSTAND YOUR EXPORTS INCLUDE SOME RICE. IS THAT
RIGHT?

LI: WE EXPORT SOME RICE AND SOY BEANS.

CURTIS: WHAT DO YOU IMPORT?

LI: A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF WHEAT, ALSO SOME FOOD GRAINS FROM
YOUR COUNTRY.

CURTIS: WHILE WE COMMEND YOUR DETERMINATION TO BE
SELF-SUFFICIENT IN FOOD GRAIN, IF YOU HAVE TO BUY ANY, PLEASE
COME TO US. SENATOR YOUNG IS A WHEAT FARMER AND SO IS

CURTIS: WE UNDERSTAND THE POTENTIAL IS VERY GREAT.

LI: YES, YOU'RE RIGHT. FURTHER EFFORTS SHOULD BE MADE FOR

FROM OUR NEIGHBOR TO THE NORTH WHO TRIED TO STRANGLE US.

UNION WILL TRY AGGRESSION.

LI: THE SOVIETS HAVE BIG AMBITIONS, AND WOULD LIKE TO HAVE THE
WHOLE GLOBE. BUT THEY ARE UNABLE TO ACHIEVE THAT BECAUSE
THEIR STRENGTH IS NOT THAT GREAT. POLITICALLY, THEY SEEK HEGEMONY
NO MATTER WHAT TRICKS OR FINE WORDS THEY USE, THEY WILL EVENTUALLY
BE EXPOSED BY THE PEOPLE OF THE WORLD. THEIR SEEKING HEGEMONY
MAKES THEM THE ENEMY OF THE WORLD'S PEOPLE. AT HOME THERE IS
LOPSIDED DEVELOPMENT IN THE SOVIET ECONOMY, THERE IS NOT ENOUGH
FOOD TO EAT, NOT ENOUGH FOOD GRAINS. SOME PEOPLE SATIRIZE THE
SOVIET UNION BY SAYING THE SOVIETS SOW SEEDS IN
THE UKRAINE AND HARVEST CROPS IN THE US.
THEIR TOP PRIORITY IS THE DEVELOPMENT OF NATIONAL DEFENSE AND IN
DOMESTIC POLICIES THE SOVIET UNION OPPRESSES THE MINORITY NATIONAL-
ITIES AND PRACTICES FASCIST RULE. ACTUALLY THEY ARE VERY
FEEBLE.

CURTIS: YOU HAVE HAD A LONG AND DISTINGUISHED CAREER AND YOU
ARE A STUDENT OF ECONOMICS. WHY IN YOUR OPINION IS THE SOVIET
ECONOMY WEAK?

LI: I'M NO STUDENT OF ECONOMICS. I'M NOT A SCHOLAR OF ECONOMICS.
BUT I DID FIGHT IN THE WAR. IN MY VIEW, THE SOVIET UNION HAS
OFFENDED THE WORKERS AND PEASANTS AND BROAD MASSES OF THE PEOPLE,
THEREFORE THERE IS NO ENTHUSIASM ON THEIR PART. IN PLANNING, THEY
GIVE PROMINENCE TO DEVELOPMENT OF NATIONAL DEFENSE. OTHER BRANCHES
OF INDUSTRY -- MACHINE BUILDING, CHEMICALS, ETC, -- ARE LAGGING BE-
HIND. IN RELATIONS BETWEEN INDUSTRY AND AGRICULTURE, THEY
NEGLECT THE DEVELOPMENT OF AGRICULTURE. YOU CAN STUDY WHETHER OR
NOT I'M RIGHT. IN THE SOVIET UNION LINE, PRINCIPLES, AND
POLICIES ARE ALL WRONG. THEY PRACTICE REVISIONISM AND FASCISM,
AND THERE IS NO WAY TO MOBILIZE THE ENTHUSIASM OF THE WORKERS,
PEASANTS AND OTHER PEOPLE.

CURTIS: WE IN THE U.S. ARE VERY AWARE OF THE SOVIET MILITARY
THREAT AND THE GREAT SUMS THEY ARE SPENDING ON ARMAMENTS. THAT IS
WHY WE INTEND TO STAY STRONG, WHY WE MAKE SACRIFICES IN MANY
PARTS OF THE WORLD TO RESIST SOVIET AGGRESSION.

LI: WE ARE ALSO AWARE OF SOVIET MILITARY STRENGTH, BUT THEY

CURTIS: DO YOU THINK THE SOVIETS HAVE PLANS FOR WESTERN EUROPE IF
THEY ARE NOT RESISTED?

LI: WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY PLANS? THE SOVIETS THINK FIRST OF ALL
ABOUT EUROPE.

CURTIS: I MEAN AGGRESSIVE PLANS.

LI: SOME PEOPLE IN THE WORLD TEND TO THINK THAT THE FOCUS
OF SOVIET STRATEGY LIES IN THE EAST. CHAIRMAN MAO THOUGHT THAT
THE SOVIET STRATEGIC FOCUS WAS IN EUROPE, INCLUDING THE MIDDLE
EAST. THIS DOES NOT MEAN WE WILL SLACKEN OUR VIGILANCE. WE ARE
HEIGHTENING OUR VIGILANCE. THAT IS WHY WE DIG TUNNELS DEEP AND
STORE GRAIN EVERYWHERE. BY DIGGING TUNNELS DEEP WE MEAN IF THE
SOVIETS INVADE US WE WILL FIGHT BACK. MAO TAUGHT US TO PREPARE
AGAINST WAR, PREPARE AGAINST NATURAL DISASTERS, AND DO EVERYTHING
FOR THE PEOPLE. BY PREPARING FOR WAR WE MEAN IF THE SOVIETS ATTACK
CHINA, WE CERTAINLY WILL FIGHT BACK. BUT THE FOCUS OF SOVIET
STRATEGY REMAINS IN EUROPE INCLUDING THE MIDDLE EAST. SO WE
SUPPORT A UNITED EUROPE. BUT AT PRESENT THE
EUROPEAN COUNTRIES ARE TOO DIVIDED.

CURTIS: DO YOU SUPPORT THE EFFORTS OF THE UNITED STATES TO
MAKE NATO STRONG?

LI: YOU CAN'T AFFORD TO LEAVE EUROPE, NEITHER CAN EUROPE.

CURTIS: THE US HAS ASSUMED RESPONSIBILITY IN SO MANY PLACES
IN THE WORLD AND WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE THOSE RESPONSIBILITIES. SO
WE WELCOME THE SUPPORT OF THE GREAT PEOPLE OF CHINA IN OPPOSITION
TO SOVIET AGGRESSION.

AND ALL OTHER PEOPLES OF THE WORLD.

CURTIS: DO THE SOVIETS HAVE MANY TROOPS ON YOUR BORDERS?

LI: THEY CLAIM TO HAVE STATIONED ABOUT ONE MILLION TROOPS ON THE
BORDER. THE BORDER EXTENDS OVER MANY THOUSANDS OF KILOMETERS. ITS
A LONG FRONT LINE. DO YOU THINK THE ONE MILLION TROOPS ARE
DIRECTED AGAINST CHINA ONLY? I THINK THEY ARE PRIMARILY DIRECTED
AGAINST THE U.S., THEN AGAINST JAPAN, AND OF COURSE ARE ALSO
DIRECTED AGAINST CHINA. ONE MILLION TROOPS IS NOT ENOUGH TO FIGHT
AGAINST CHINA. EVEN IF THEY ADDED ANOTHER ONE MILLION IT WOULD
NOT BE ENOUGH, NOR EVEN TWO MILLION MORE. IF THE SOVIETS COME,
WE'LL YIELD SOME PLACES TO THEM, THEN CLOSE OUR DOOR AND BEAT THE
DOG INSIDE THE ROOM. WHEN THE DOOR IS CLOSED, IT IS EASIER TO
DEAL WITH THE DOG AND TO BEAT THE DOG. THAT WAS THE WAY WE
FOUGHT THE JAPANESE. WE CLOSED THE DOOR AND THOROUGHLY
ANNIHILATED THE JAPANESE. AT THAT TIME, CHINA WAS RULED BY
CHIANG KAI-SHEK AND LARGE TRACTS OF TERRITORY IN THE NORTH AND
CENTRAL CHINA WERE LEFT TO US BECAUSE CHIANG KAI-SHEK RAN AWAY.
CHIANG KAI-SHEK FIRST RAN FROM THE NORTHEAST AND THE JAPANESE
OCCUPIED IT. THEN FROM NORTH, CENTRAL, SOUTH AND EAST CHINA.
CHIANG KAI-SHEK TROOPS WERE RUNNING IN FRONT OF THE JAPANESE AND
OUR TROOPS WERE RUNNING AFTER THE JAPANESE. THEY TURNED THEIR

OF RESISTANCE AGAINST THE JAPANESE, NORTH, CENTRAL, EVEN EAST AND
SOUTH CHINA WAS LED BY THE COMMUNIST PARTY. SO ONE MILLION
SOVIET TROOPS ON THE BORDER WILL BE NO MATCH FOR US.
IN FINAL ANALYSIS, THE FOCUS OF THE SOVIET STRATEGY IS EUROPE.
MY FRIENDS MAY NOT BELIEVE MY WORDS BUT FACTS WILL BEAR ME
OUT. AS FOR THE DISARMAMENT THEY ARE ALWAYS
TALKING ABOUT, WE DON'T BELIEVE IT.

CURTIS: WHAT WOULD BE THE BEST STRATEGY IN EUROPE TO OPPOSE
SOVIET AGGRESSION?

LI: I DON'T KNOW. THE SOVIET UNION WANTS TO SWALLOW UP THAT
PLACE.

CURTIS: ARE YOU MAKING PROGRESS IN YOUR ARMAMENT PROGRAM?

LI: SINCE WE MUST MAKE PREPARATIONS AGAINST WAR, WE MUST MANUFACTURE
SOME THINGS.

CURTIS: YOU HAVE BEEN VERY GRACIOUS IN RECEIVING US. I WOULD LIKE TO
YIELD AT THIS POINT TO THE VICE CHAIRMAN OF OUR DELEGATION,
SENATOR BIRCH BAYH OF THE STATE OF INDIANA. HE MIGHT WISH TO MAKE
SOME COMMENTS OR ASK SOME QUESTIONS.

BAYH: MR. VICE PREMIER. THIS IS MY FIRST TIME IN YOUR COUNTRY.

I SAW IT THROUGH THE EYES OF MY FATHER WHO WAS HERE AT THE TIME WHEN
SENATOR STEVENS WAS HERE, BUT IT'S NOT LIKE SEEING IT MYSELF. MY WIFE

AT THE BANQUET AND TO ALL THOSE, INCLUDING MADAME KANG, WHO HAVE
SHOWN US THE KINDEST HOSPITALITY.

LI: WHAT YEARS WAS YOUR FATHER IN CHINA?

BAYH: 1943-45. I'M A FARMER BASICALLY AS WELL AS A SENATOR. I HAVE
BEEN IMPRESSED BY THE WAY THAT THE GREATEST AMOUNT OF PRODUCTION IS
OBTAINED FROM EACH SQUARE CENTIMETER OF GROUND, BY THE INDUSTRIOUS-

WE CAN THUS REALIZE BETTER THE DEPTH OF THE GRIEF YOUR COUNTRY MUST

SOMETIME THIS YEAR YOU WILL PROMULGATE YOUR FIFTH FIVE YEAR PLAN OF
YOUR COUNTRY. ARE THERE ELEMENTS IN THIS PLAN WHICH YOU COULD DISCLOS

ASPECTS. IT IS DIFFICULT TO DISCUSS IN A SYSTEMATIC WAY.
DURING HIS LIFETIME, CHAIRMAN MAO NOT ONLY LAID DOWN THE BASIC
LINE FOR POLICY BUT ALSO THE BASIC LINE AND
PRINCIPLES FOR CONSTRUCTION OF THE COUNTRY. THESE PRINCIPLES WERE
CONFIDENTIAL

CONFIDENTIAL

PAGE 02        PEKING 02368  05 OF 07  161519Z

STATED IN THE REPORT BY THE LATE PREMIER CHOU EN-LAI AT THE FOURTH NP
C.
HE DISCUSSED THE MODERNIZATION OF INDUSTRY, AGRICULTURE, NATIONAL
DEFENSE, AND SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY. IN MAKING ECONOMIC PLANS, WE
MUST FIRST THINK OF THE 800 MILLION PEOPLE AND BEAR
IN MIND THE FOOD, CLOTHING AND HOUSING PROBLEMS OF 800 MILLION PEOPLE
.
SO WE PLAN THE ECONOMY IN THE ORDER OF AGRICULTURE, LIGHT INDUSTRY
AND HEAVY INDUSTRY. THIS WAS CONSISTENT WITH THE TEACHINGS OF CHAIRMA
N
MAO THAT WE MUST FIRST DEVELOP AGRICULTURE. IF WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH
FOOD FOR OUR PEOPLE, EVEN IF WE IMPORT 10 OR 20 MILLION TONS OF GRAIN
,
THIS WOULD NOT SOLVE OUR PROBLEM. IF AGRICULTURE IS DEVELOPED, IT
IS EASIER TO DEVELOP LIGHT INDUSTRY, AND HEAVY INDUSTRY WILL HAVE A
SOLID FOUNDATION. SO WE MAKE OUR PLANS ACCORDING TO THIS PRINCIPLE.
WE HAVE A PLAN BUT IT IS NOT YET FINALIZED. WE HAVE NO INTENTION OF
MAKING IT PUBLIC. THE PLAN HAS NOT YET MATURED AND IS STILL UNDER
DISCUSSION. IN DISCUSSING IT WE MAY FIND NEW PROBLEMS AND REVISE THE
PLAN. AS FOR RELATIONS BETWEEN OUR TWO COUNTRIES, ESPECIALLY
TRADE, IT REMAINS TO BE SEEN. WE HAVE BOUGHT SOME EQUIPMENT FROM THE
US
--SUCH AS CHEMICAL FERTILIZER PLANTS.

BAYH: THE KELLOGG UREA PLANTS.

LI: IT DEPENDS ON WHETHER WE NEED THIS AND ARE ABLE TO DO IT. THE
QUESTION OF NECESSITY IS EASY. BUT IF WE ASK OUR MINISTER, HE WILL
ASK FOR MANY THINGS. AS FOR OUR ABILITY, THAT IS VERY DIFFICULT,
WE DON'T HAVE THE MONEY TO BUY. ON PRINCIPLE WE RELY ON OUR OWN
EFFORTS. MAINLY WE RELY ON OUR OWN EFFORTS. WE DO NOT PLAN TO BE IN
DEBT. WE WERE ONCE IN DEBT TO THE SOVIET UNION. OUR DEBTS TO THE SOVI
ET
UNION WERE INCURRED IN 1950-51 DURING THE WAR OF RESISTANCE AGAINST
THE U.S. AND TO ASSIST KOREA. WE FOUGHT A WAR IN THAT COUNTRY, OUR
TWO COUNTRIES. IT IS NOT PLEASANT TO BE A DEBTOR.

BAYH: IT IS NOT PLEASANT TO BE A CREDITOR OF THE SOVIETS EITHER.

LI: PERHAPS THE SOVIET UNION FINDS IT PLEASANT. THEN WE MADE
OUR MINDS UP TO REPAY ALL DEBTS TO THE SOVIET UNION. AFTER THAT WE
CONFIDENTIAL

CONFIDENTIAL

PAGE 03        PEKING 02368  05 OF 07  161519Z

NEVER INCURRED ANY FOREIGN OR DOMESTIC DEBTS. ONCE WE ISSUED PUBLIC
BONDS BUT WE LATER REPAID THEM. SO AS TO TRADE BETWEEN OUR
TWO COUNTRIES, WE'LL HAVE TO SE. I HAVE JUST SAID THAT IT DEPENDS ON
NECESSITY AND ABILITY. ANOTHER THING IS YOUR HIGH TARRIFF WHICH IS
TROUBLESOME. I THINK IT IS NOT EASY TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM FOR THE
TIME BEING. ROUGHLY THIS IS WHERE WE ARE AT THE PRESENT STAGE. I
THINK WE IMPORT MORE FROM THE U.S. THAN YOU DO FROM US.

BAYH: YOU HAVE BEEN VERY KIND AND I APPRECIATE YOUR RESPONSE.
WHAT I ASKED WAS IN RESPECT TO OUR FUTURE RELATIONS. I THINK THAT TO
THE EXTENT THAT WE CAN INCREASE TRADE OPPORTUNITIES, PERMIT MORE
PEOPLE OF THE US TO VISIT CHINA AND MORE CHINESE TO VISIT THE U.S.
-- THERE HAS BEEN SOME OF THIS BUT IT SHOULD BE INCREASED -- TO
THE EXTENT THAT TRADE AND OTHER OPEN DOOR POLICIES CAN BE PURSUED
THEY WILL HELP TO FIND A SOLUTION. THE GROUP HERE IS GOING BACK
AS AMBASSADORS OF GOODWILL FOR CHINA.

LI: AT PRESENT THERE ARE LOTS OF EXCHANGES ALREADY.

CURTIS: WE FEEL PRIVILEGED AND APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO
CARRY ON THIS CONVERSATION WITH YOU. I WOULD LIKE TO EXTEND TO
MY COLLEAGUES THE OPPORTUNITY TO SAY SOMETHING OR TO ASK QUESTIONS.

YOUNG: FIRST I WOULD LIKE TO SAY THAT I DEEPLY APPRECIATE THE
REAL FRIENDSHIP WHICH WE HAVE RECEIVED WHILE HERE. YOU HAVE OPENED
YOUR DOORS TO US AND SHOWED US REAL FRIENDSHIP. I WOULD LIKE TO SAY
ALSO THAT NO OTHER NATION IN THE WORLD COULD FEED, CLOTHE, EDUCATE,
AND PROVIDE SUCH GOOD CARE OF 800 MILLION PEOPLE. TO DO THIS AND TO
STAY OUT OF DEBT IS SOMETHING. WE COULD LEARN A FEW THINGS FROM YOU A

HOLLINGS: MR. VICE PREMIER, I APPRECIATE VERY MUCH THE OPPORTUNITY
AND I AM PARTICULARLY HONORED TO HAVE THIS CONVERSATION WITH YOU,
SINCE YOU ARE WELL KNOWN IN THE U.S. AS ONE OF THE LAST OF THE
VETERANS OF THE LONG MARCH AND AS A PARTNER WITH CHAIRMAN MAO
AND PREMIER CHOU IN THE MODERNIZATION OF CHINA.

LI: WE'LL WORK STILL HARDER TO BUILD OUR COUNTRY UNDER THE
LEADERSHIP OF THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE HEADED BY CHAIRMAN HUA, RELYING
ON THE EFFORTS OF THE PROPLE.

HOLLINGS: AS A SENATOR, I MUST POINT OUT THAT I SPEAK INDIVIDUALLY.
WE ARE TOLD THATANYTHING A U.S. SENATOR MAY UTTER IS CONSIDERED
A POSITION OF THE USG. THAT IS NOT TRUE. EACH ONE OF US SPEAKS FOR
HIMSELF. THERE ARE FIVE OTHER SENATORS HERE AND THEY DO NOT
SPEAK FOR ME AND I CANNOT SPEAK FOR THEM. I BELIEVE YOU HAVE AN
INVESTMENT IN THE TIME AND EFFORT IT TOOK TO BRING ME
ALL THE WAY TO CHINA AND I WISH TO SPEAK FRANKLY. SPEAKING FOR
MYSELF,
WE BELIEVE IN THE PRINCIPLES OF THE SHANGHAI COMMUNIQUE AND WE
BELIEVE WE ARE ADHERING TO THE PRINCIPLES, AND AS THE COMMUNIQUE
STATES, AS TENSIONS EASE, WE CAN CONTINUE TO MAKE PROGRESS UNDER THE
SHANGHAI COMMUNIQUE. WE BELIEVE THIS TRIP SO GENEROUSLY PROVIDED TO

US HAS HELPED TO EASE TENSIONS AND CERTAINLY HAS ENHANCED MY UNDER-
STANDING AND APPRECIATION OF CHINA. AS SENATOR, I BELIEVE THAT THERE
IS ONE CHINA AND THAT YOU ARE THAT CHINA.

LI: YOU'RE RIGHT.

HOLLINGS: HOWEVER, WE HAVE HAD FRIENDS OF LONG STANDING ON
TAIWAN AND AS A SENATOR, I DON'T BELIEVE THE MAJORITY OF THE
U.S. SENATORS WOULD ABRUPTLY ABANDON THAT FRIENDSHIP. A JOURNEY OF
1,000 MILES, THEY SAY IN CHINA, BEGINS WITH ONE STEP. I THINK WE
SHOULD MAKE STEPS TOGETHER TO TRY TO INCREASE TRADE,
OPEN AIR ROUTES, AND ON OUR SIDE REDUCE TROOPS ON TAIWAN TO
MAKE STEPS TO THE REALIZATION OF THE SHANGHAI COMMUNIQUE
PRINCIPLES. WE IN THE US HAVE NEVER BELIEVED IN HEGEMONY. THE FACT IN
OUR LONG HISTORY IS THAT WE GAVE FREEDOM TO THE PHILIPPINES
AND CUBA.
AFTER WORLD WAR II IN WHICH WE DEFEATED GERMANY, ITALY, AND JAPAN,
WE NOT ONLY GAVE THEM FREEDOM BUT ALSO FINANCED THEIR RECOVERY.

LI: PEOPLE IN THE WORLD BELIEVE YOU STILL HAVE SOME HEGEMONY.

HOLLINGS:
WE ABSOLUTELY REFUTE THAT BY OUR OWN ACTS OVER 200 YEARS
OF HISTORY. WE WISH NOTHING BUT FREEDOM FOR THE PEOPLES AND I THINK
THE U.S. AND CHINA WORKING TOGETHER COULD BRING ABOUT FREEDOM AND
ECONOMIC SUSTENANCE TO THE THIRD WORLD.
I'M SURE THIS VISIT HAS SERVED AS A PLATFORM OR STJATING POINT FOR
ME AS A SENATOR TO UNDERSTAND AND APPRECIATE THE GREATNESS OF CHINA
AND I HOPE SIMILAR VISITS BY YOUR DISTINGUISHED LEADERS TO THE U.S.
WILL FOLLOW.

LI: HOW CAN WE GO TO THE US SINCE THE EMBASSY OF THE TAIWAN CLIQUE IS
THERE?

HOLLINGS: THAT'S ONE OF THE PROBLEMS WE WILL HAVE TO SOLVE
AND WE IN THE SENATE WILL BE WORKING ON THAT PROBLEM.

LI: THE SOLUTION MUST CONFORM TO THE SHANGHAI COMMUNIQUE.

WHERE I WAS STATIONED DURING THE WAR. IT MAY INTEREST YOU TO KNOW
THAT THOSE OF US IN THE AIR FORCE HERE HAD GREAT RES SECT FOR YOUR
PEOPLE IN THE NORTH.MY SQUADRON SUPPLIED YOUR TROOPS AT TIMES. YOU
SPEAK THE TRUTH WHEN YOU SAY YOU REALLY FOUGHT THE JAPANESE. WE
KNEW THAT AND RESPECTED YOU FOR IT. MY LARGE COLLEAGUE FROM THE
SOUTH,
HE SPEAKS CANDIDLY AND WE RESPECT HIS CANDOR. BUT I'D LIKE TO
PURSUE HIS POINT. ISN'T THERE SOME WAY WE COULD START THE FLOW
OF VISITS BOTH WAYS? WE HAVE DIFFICULTIES IN CONGRESS IN BEING
ABLE TO FOLLOW THROUGH ON THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS RELATIONSHIP
BASED ON A LACK OF UNDERSTANDING. YOUR PEOPLE HAVE DOUBLED SINCE I
WAS HERE. YOUR HOUSING AND FOOD PROBLEMS HAVE BEEN SOLVED, BUT THAT
WORD ISN'T GETTING BACK TO THE U.S. WE NEED MORE OF OUR PEOPLE
COMING THIS WAY BUT ALSO MORE OF YOUR PEOPLE COMING TO THE U.S. TO
VISIT
COLLEGES, OUR COUNTIES, OUR CITIES, TO INCREASE FRIENDSHIP AND
UNDERSTANDING. I HAVE BEEN AMAZED BY THE FRIENDSHIP I HAVE FOUND
HERE.
I AM DEEPLY IMPRESSED BY THE SMILES I HAVE SEEN ON THE
STREETS HERE BECAUSE I DIDN'T SEE THAT DURING THE WAR. PERHAPS
PEOPLE DON'T SMILE DURING WARS. BUT THIS IS A TWO WAY STREET, THIS
APPROACH TO NORMALIZATION. SOMEHOW I DON'T SEE MUCH COMING OUR WAY

AND THE MINOR QUESTION IS TAIWAN. I THINK SHE PUT THE QUESTION
VERY WELL. NEVERTHELESS TAIWAN REMAINS AN ISSUE. I THINK OUR
AMERICAN FRIENDS, ESPECIALLY MR. GATES, KNOW OUR VIEWS VERY
WELL SO I WON'T DISCUSS THIS ANY MORE.

JOHNSTON: MR. VICE PREMIER, I WOULD LIKE TO ADD MY THANKS FOR THE
WARM HOSPITALITY, I AM PARTICULARLY REASSURED AND
PLEASED TO LEARN THAT CHAIRMAN HUA IS COMMITTED
TO CHAIRMAN MAO'S POLICIES IN CARRYING OUT THE PRINCIPLES OF THE
SHANGHAI COMMUNIQUE, AND TO DEVELOP FURTHER RELATIONSHIPS AND
COOPERATION BETWEEN OUR TWO COUNTRIES.

LI: YOU ARE RIGHT THAT WE WILL CARRY OUT THE BEHEST OF CHAIRMAN
MAO.

JOHNSTON: IN OUR COUNTRY, POLICY DOES NOT TRICKLE DOWN FROM THE
TOP BUT COMES UP FROM THE PEOPLE. PRESIDENTS HAVE FOUND THIS OUT

IN A COUPLE OF INSTANCES, MOST RECENTLY IN OUR POLICIES IN SOUTHEAST
ASIA AND THE MIDDLE EAST. WHAT MY COLLEAGUES ARE TRYING TO SAY IS THAT

WE ARE TRYING TO HELP YOU AND YOU MUST HELP US WITH OUR PEOPLE IN
DEVELOPING THIS FRIENDSHIP.

CURTIS: MR. VICE PREMIER, THIS HAS BEEN A MOST ENJOYABLE AND HELPFUL
OCCASION. I AM GRATEFUL TO YOU FOR HAVING RECEIVED US AND EXPRESS THE
GRATITUDE OF ALL OF US FOR THE INVITATION TO BRING OUR WIVES ALONG.
THEY ARE A AVERY INFLUENTIAL GROUP AND HAVE ENJOYED IT, ESPECIALLY
OUR HOSPITAL TRIP YESTERDAY TO SEE YOUR ADVANCES IN CANCER
TREATMENT. THANK YOU FOR THIS AND I EXPRESS THE GRATITUDE OF ALL
OF US.

LI: YOU SHOULD HAVE ASKED THE LADIES TO SIT IN FRONT.

CURTIS: YOU ARE A VERY WISE MAN.

LI: WE MUST SHOW RESPECT FOR THE LADIES. I WOULD LIKE TO THANK
YOU FOR COMING, FOR HAVING TRAVELLED SO FAR. I EXPRESS
MY WELCOME TO YOU.
