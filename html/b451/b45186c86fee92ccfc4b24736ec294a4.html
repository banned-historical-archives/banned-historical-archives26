		<h3>Tor</h3>
		<p><a href="https://www.torproject.org">Tor</a> is an encrypted anonymising network that makes it harder to intercept internet communications, or see where communications are coming from or going to.</p>
		<p>In order to use the WikiLeaks public submission system as detailed above you can download the Tor Browser Bundle, which is a Firefox-like browser available for Windows, Mac OS X and GNU/Linux and pre-configured to connect using the anonymising system Tor.</p>
		<h4>Tails</h4>
		<p>If you are at high risk and you have the capacity to do so, you can also access the submission system through a secure operating system called <a href="https://tails.boum.org">Tails</a>. Tails is an operating system launched from a USB stick or a DVD that aim to leaves no traces when the computer is shut down after use and automatically routes your internet traffic through Tor. Tails will require you to have either a USB stick or a DVD at least 4GB big and a laptop or desktop computer.</p>

		<h3>Tips</h3>
		<p>Our submission system works hard to preserve your anonymity, but we recommend you also take some of your own precautions. Please review these basic guidelines. </p>
		<div>
			<h4>1. Contact us if you have specific problems</h4>
			<p>If you have a very large submission, or a submission with a complex format, or are a high-risk source, please <a href="#submit_help_contact">contact us</a>. In our experience it is always possible to find a custom solution for even the most seemingly difficult situations.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h4>2. What computer to use</h4>
			<p>If the computer you are uploading from could subsequently be audited in an investigation, consider using a computer that is not easily tied to you. Technical users can also use <a href="https://tails.boum.org">Tails</a> to help ensure you do not leave any records of your submission on the computer.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h4>3. Do not talk about your submission to others</h4>
			<p>If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in source protection – it is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This includes other media organisations.</p>
		</div>

	</div>

		<h3>After</h3>

		<div>
			<h4>1. Do not talk about your submission to others</h4>
			<p>If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in source protection – it is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This includes other media organisations.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h4>2. Act normal</h4>
			<p>If you are a high-risk source, avoid saying anything or doing anything after submitting which might promote suspicion. In particular, you should try to stick to your normal routine and behaviour.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h4>3. Remove traces of your submission</h4>
			<p>If you are a high-risk source and the computer you prepared your submission on, or uploaded it from, could subsequently be audited in an investigation, we recommend that you format and dispose of the computer hard drive and any other storage media you used.</p>
			<p>In particular, hard drives retain data after formatting which may be visible to a digital forensics team and flash media (USB sticks, memory cards and SSD drives) retain data even after a secure erasure. If you used flash media to store sensitive data, it is important to destroy the media.</p>
			<p>If you do this and are a high-risk source you should make sure there are no traces of the clean-up, since such traces themselves may draw suspicion.</p>
			<div>
				<h4>4. If you face legal action</h4>
				<p>If a legal action is brought against you as a result of your submission, there are organisations that may help you. The Courage Foundation is an international organisation dedicated to the protection of journalistic sources. You can find more details at <a href="https://www.couragefound.org">https://www.couragefound.org</a>.</p>

		<p>WikiLeaks publishes documents of political or historical importance that are censored or otherwise suppressed. We specialise in strategic global publishing and large archives.</p>
		<p>The following is the address of our secure site where you can anonymously upload your documents to WikiLeaks editors. You can only access this submissions system through Tor. (See our <a href="#submit_help_tor">Tor tab</a> for more information.) We also advise you to read our <a href="#submit_help_tips">tips for sources</a> before submitting.</p>

			<!--<div>
				Copy this address into your Tor browser. Advanced users, if they wish, can also add a further layer of encryption to their submission using <a href="#submit_wlkey">our public PGP key</a>.
			</div>-->
		</div>

		<p>If you cannot use Tor, or your submission is very large, or you have specific requirements, WikiLeaks provides several alternative methods. <a href="#submit_help_contact">Contact us</a> to discuss how to proceed.</p>

AMBASSADOR CHARLES YOST AND NATIONAL COMMITTEE ON US-

CHINA RELATIONS BOARD DELEGATION
DAVID DEAN, USLO

CHRIS SZYMANSKI, USLO

3. YOST: WE APPRECIATE YOUR WELCOME. FOUR YEARS AGO









WHEN I WAS HERE I HAD THE HONOR OF BEING RECEIVED BY
PREMIER CHOU EN-LAI. NOW I HAVE THE HONOR OF BEING

RECEIVED BY THE VICE PREMIER.


4. TENG: THANK YOU.


5. YOST: WE HAVE BEEN GIVEN EXCELLENT CARE BY
AMBASSADOR HAO, AND THE MEMBERS OF THE CHINESE PEOPLE'S
INSTITUTE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS.


6. TENG: AS YOU KNOW, LAST YEAR WE LOST CHAIRMAN

MAO, PREMIER CHOU AND NATIONAL PEOPLE'S CONGRESS
CHAIRMAN CHU TEH. DO YOU SMOKE? HELP YOURSELVES.

YES INDEED, LAST YEAR THE GANG OF FOUR WAS RAMPANT AND
CAUSED SABOTAGE IN MANY FIELDS.


7. YOST: YES, WE KNOW THAT LAST YEAR WAS TRAGIC BUT

WE HAVE BEEN REASSURED ABOUT YOUR RECOVERY. WE ARE
INTERESTED IN LEARNING ABOUT YOUR PLANS FOR ECONOMIC

DEVELOPMENT, SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY AND MODERNIZATION.


8. TENG: NOW WE ARE STARTING WORK IN ALL THESE FIELDS.
DURING THE LAST TEN YEARS, THESE FIELDS EXPERIENCED

SABOTAGE BY THE GANG OF FOUR. THE GANG OF FOUR IS IN
THE SAME CATEGORY AS LIN PAIO. IT WAS AT THE TIME WHEN
CHAIRMAN MAO WAS CRITICALLY ILL THAT THE UGLY FEATURES

CONFIDENTIAL


CONFIDENTIAL


PAGE 03    PEKING 02447 01 OF 03 250439Z


OF THE GANG OF FOUR WERE REVEALED AND THEY STEPPED
UP THEIR ACTIVITIES TO SEIZE POWER. WHEN THEIR FEA-

TURES WERE REVEALED, WE TOOK PROMPT AND RESOLUTE ACTION
TO DEAL WITH THE GANG OF FOUR UNDER THE LEADERSHIP OF

CHAIRMAN HUA AND THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE. THIS HAS
ENABLED US TO TAKE MEASURES TO REALIZE THE FOUR MODERN-

IZATIONS. THIS WAS NOT POSSIBLE IN THE PAST. NOW WE
CAN MAKE GREAT EFFORTS. A LOT OF TIME HAS BEEN LOST.

NOW WE CAN CATCH UP AND GO FASTER. NOW THE MOST
FAVORABLE CONDITIONS ARE THE UNITY OF MINDS IN THE
LEADERSHIP AND THE MASSES' ENTHUSIASM. ACTUALLY, THE

GOAL OF THE FOUR MODERNIZATIONS -- AGRICULTURE, INDUS-
TRY, NATIONAL DEFENSE AND SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY --

WERE SET FORTH BY CHAIRMAN MAO AND ENUNCIATED BY
PREMIER CHOU EN-LAI ON MORE THAN ONE OCCASION. THESE

WERE OFFICIALLY SET FORTH BY PREMIER CHOU IN HIS
REPORT ON THE WORK OF THE GOVERNMENT IN JANUARY 1975

AT TNE NATIONAL PEOPLE'S CONGRESS (TENG
CHECKED WITH OTHERS PRESENT FOR THE EXACT DATE). THE

GANG OF FOUR OPPOSED THE FOUR MODERNIZATIONS.


9. FOR INSTANCE, LEARNING FROM THE ADVANCED EXPERIENCES









OF THE WORLD IS A PRINCIPLE OF CHAIRMAN MAO'S THAT WAS
CARRIED OUT BY PREMIER CHOU. THE GANG OF FOUR LABELED

IT ASA SLAVISH COMPRADOR PHILOSOPHY. THE CONSISTENT
POLICY OF CHAIRMAN MAO'S IS TO RELY ON OUR OWN EFFORTS.

THIS PRINCIPLE OF SELF-RELIANCE WILL BE ADHERED TO IN
THE FUTURE. BY SELF-RELIANCE, WE MEAN HAVING SELF-

CONFIDENCE. BY SELF-RELIANCE, CHAIRMAN MAO MEANT TO
RELY MAINLY ON OUR OWN EFFORTS BUT ALSO TO ABSORB THE

ADVANCED EXPERIENCE OF OTHER NATIONS. CHAIRMAN MAO
HAD A SAYING, &quot;MAKE FOREIGN THINGS SERVE CHINA&quot;. WE

SHOULD ALSO CREATE SOMETHING. ONE OTHER ASPECT OF
SELF-RELIANCE IS THAT WE SHOULD BUILD UP BY OUR OWN

ACCUMULATED FUNDS AND NOT BY BORROWING. WE HAVE
SUFFERED A LOT AS DEBTORS. ONCE WE OWED MONEY TO

CONFIDENTIAL


CONFIDENTIAL


PAGE 04    PEKING 02447 01 OF 03 250439Z

THE SOVIET UNION AND THE SOVIET UNION WANTED TO CONTROL

US BY TAKING ADVANTAGE OF OUR DEBTS TO TURN CHINA INTO
A COLONY LIKE EASTERN EUROPE. WE BAILED OUT. (SIC)

WE SAY THAT THE SOVIET UNION TURNED FROM THE FIRST
SOCIALIST COUNTRY INTO A SOCIAL-IMPERIALIST COUNTRY.

THIS IS DRAWN FROM THE EXPERIENCES OF THE WORLD SITU-
ATION AND FROM OUR OWN EXPERIENCE. WE HAVE BUILT THE

BASIS FOR THE FOUR MODERNIZATIONS IN AGRICULTURE,
INDUSTRY, NATIONAL DEFENSE AND SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY

SINCE LIBERATION.


10. THIS BASIS WAS BUILT COMPLETELY ON OUR OWN.
THE SOVIET UNION ACTED IN BAD FAITH BY WITHDRAWING ITS

EXPERTS AND TORE UP THE PLANS FOR INDUSTRIAL PROJECTS.
IN THE EARLY DAYS OF THE FOUNDING OF THE PEOPLE'S

REPUBLIC OF CHINA, THE SOVIET UNION PROMISED US
SOMETHING WHICH WAS WITHDRAWN BY KHRUSHCHEV. THE WEST,

FOUR OBSTRUCTION IN 1974 AND THE PROPOSAL TO RAISE
WAGES DID NOT SUCCEED. IN 1975, THE SAME PROPOSAL WAS

WE ARE NOW WORKING OUT A RAISE FOR CERTAIN CATEGORIES

OF LOWER LEVEL WAGE EARNERS. THIS INVOLVES A LOT OF PEOPLE.
WITH GROWTH IN THE NATIONAL ECONOMY, WE WILL

FREQUENTLY RAISE WAGES, ESPECIALLY LOW WAGES. AS OUR
ECONOMY IS NOT DEVELOPED, EVEN IF WE ADJUST WAGES, OUR

POLICY IS ONE OF LOW WAGES. EVEN IF WE WANT TO RAISE
WAGES, IT HAS TO BE DONE STEP-BY-STEP. THEY CANNOT

WE ARE ALSO PREPARING TO RECEIVE A TROUPE THAT WILL BE

TO THE UNITED SATES AND THE MOST IMPORTANT WAS THE
CHINESE PEOPLE'S INSTITUTE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS WHICH

VISITED FOR THREE WEEKS. WE BELIEVE AND HOPE THEY

25. YOST: I WOULD LIKE TO ASK A QUESTION ABOUT

SOUTHEAST ASIA. I HAVE BEEN IN SOUTHEAST ASIA AND
EARLIER THIS YEAR I VISITED VIETNAM AND LAOS WITH

AMBASSADOR WOODCOCK. I NOTICED THAT THE CAMBODIAN
PRIME MINISTER VISITED CHINA. WE IN THE UNITED STATES

HAVE NO CONTACT WITH CAMBODIA. I WOULD APPRECIATE
YOUR COMMENTS ON SOUTHEAST ASIA.


26. TENG: IN SOUTHEAST ASIA, WE HAVE PRETTY GOOD
RELATIONS WITH CAMBODIA. WE ALSO HAVE GOOD RELATIONS

WITH LAOS AND VIETNAM. AS FOR THE FIVE COUNTRIES OF
ASEAN, WE SUPPORT THEIR PROPOSAL FOR CREATING A ZONE

OF PEACE IN SOUTHEAAST ASIA. WE HAVE ASSISTED ALL THE
INDOCHINA COUNTRIES. VIETNAM GETS THE MOST. IT

FOUGHT A WAR WITH YOU. OUR AID WAS GREATER THAN THE
SOVIET UNION'S DURING THE WAR. IN CAMBODIA, OUR AID

WAS VERY LITTLE. IT WAS ISOLATED GEOGRAPHICALLY AND
CONFIDENTIAL


CONFIDENTIAL


PAGE 02    PEKING 02447 03 OF 03 250509Z


IT WAS DIFFICULT TO TRANSPORT AID THERE. SO THE

CAMBODIANS RELIED ON THEIR OWN EFFORTS. EVEN NOW, OUR
ASSISTANCE TO VIETNAM IS LARGER THAN CAMBODIA AND LAOS.
WE APPRECIATE THE POLICY OF THE CAMBODIANS. THEY DON'T

RAISE MANY QUESTIONS FOR ASSISTANCE. WE KNOW THEY ARE
DOING WELL, ESPECIALLY IN AGRICULTURE.


27. YOST: LAST MARCH WHEN I WAS IN SOUTHEAST ASIA,

THEREWAS MUCH CONCERN OVER THE CAMBODIAN-THAI AND
CAMBODIA-VIETNAMESE BORDER TENSION. IS IT QUIETER

NOW? IS THERE STILL CONCERN?


28. TENG: RECENTLY WE HAVE HAD NO CONTACTS WITH LAOS.
BUT PRIME MINISTER POL POT VISITED RECENTLY AND WE

LEARNED SOM INFORMATION FROM THIS. WE KNOW THAILAND'S









ATTITUDE. BOTH SIDES WANT TO SETTLE THIS QUESTION IN
THE PROPER WAY. WE SUPPORT THESE EFFORTS. WE NOTE

THAT BOTH SIDES THINK THIS IS A MINOR MATTER. THE
IMPORTANT THING IS THE IMPROVEMENT OF RELATIONS.


29. HENRY SAILOR: YOU HAVE MADE EFFORTS AT CONTROLLING

YOUR POPULATION. IS ZERO POPULATION GROWTH POSSIBLE?
DO YOU CONSIDER IT AN IMPORTANT GOAL?


30. TENG: IT WILL BE DIFFICULT TO REACH THE GOAL OF

ZERO POPULATION GROWTH (TENG LAUGHS), BUT WE HOPE WE
CAN ATTAIN THIS GOAL. MUCH WORK IS REQUIRED IN THE

COUNTRYSIDE BECAUSE THERRE HASBEEN A TRADITION SINCE
ANCIENT TIMES THAT BIG FAMILIES ARE PREFERRED. THERE

HAS BEEN SUCCESS IN A NUMBER OF AREAS. THINGS ARE
BETTER IN THECITIES. IN KIANGSU FOR EXAMPLE, POPU-

LATION GROWTH IN THE CITIESAND IN THE COUNTRYSIDE IS
BELOW ONE PERCENT. THIS IS THE DIRECTION WE ARE TAKING.

31. YOST: IN AGRICULTURE, HINA HAS DONE VERY WELL.

DOES THE VICE PREMIER ENVISION CHANGES IN AGRICULTURAL
PRODUCTION METHODS AND COOPERATION WITH THE WORLD

COMMUNITY IN DEALING WITH THE FOOD PROBLEM ?


32. TENG: WE DO NOT FEEL SATISFIED WITH OUR AGRI-
CULTURAL PRODUCTION BUT THE POTENTIAL IS GREAT. WE

HAVE HELD TWO MEETINGS IN LEARNING FROM TACHAI IN
AGRCULTURE UNDER THE CHAIRMANSHIP OF HUA KUO-FENG.

IF ONE THIRD OF OUR COUNTRIES CAN BE TUNED INTO
TACHAI-TYPE COUNTIES, THE FOOD PROBLEM WILL NOT ONLY

BE SOLVED THERE WILL BE A BIG SURPLUS. WE ARE STEPPING
UP OUR EFFORTS TO MECAHNIZE AGRICULTURE. IT IS

POSSIBLE TO REALIZE OUR PLANS IN AGRICULTURE. IN
TERMS O EXCHANGES, CHINA LEARNS FROM THE GOOD EXPERIENCES

OF OTHERS AS WELL. BUT THERE ARE DIFFERENT CHARACTERIS-
TICS IN CHINA, DIFFERENT FROM OTHERS, EVEN THE UNITED STATES.

IN CHINA, EACH REGION IS DIFFERENT. I WILL
GIVE YOU A STATISTIC. 7.5 PEOPLE SHARE ONE HECTARE OF

LAND IN CHINA. BUT IN KWANGTUNG, 17 OR 18 PEOPLE SHARE
ONE HECTARE. SO OUR PROBLEMS ARE QQUITE DIFFERENT THAN

YOURS. IN ORDER TO RAISE MORE GRAIN FROM SUCH SMALL
PLOTS, WE HAVE TO RELY ON OUR OWN EFFORTS. BUT THIS

DOESN'T MEAN WE WILL NOT LEARN FROM FOREIGN COUNTRIES,
ESPECIALLY IN SEEDS, CHEMICAL FERTILIZERS AND OTHER
QUESTIONS. MECHANIZATION ALONE CANNOT SOLVE THE PROB-










LEM. WE HAVE TO DO INTENSIVE FARMING AND SEVERAL
CROPS A YEAR IN THE SOUTH.

TECHNOLOGY CANNOT BE TRANSFERRED EASILY TO OTHER COUN-

ASK ONE MORE QUESTION ON THE ECONOMY. WE JUST VISITED

AN OIL REFINERY. DOES THE VICE PREMIER BELIEVE THE
PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA WILL BE ABLE TO XPORT A

SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF OIL PRODUCTS OR WILL MOST OF IT
BE USED FOR DOMESTIC CONSUMPTION? THIS IS AN IMPORTANT

INTERNATIONAL QUESTION BECAUSE OF THE SERIOUS ENERGY
CRISIS.


34. TENG: WE ARE PREPARED TO EXPORT MORE OIL PRODUCTS.

WE CAN DO THAT. ACCORDING TO OUR OWN STATISTICS, WE
HAVE LARGE OIL DEPOSITS. WE ARE BASICALLY ABLE TO

SOLVE THE EXPLORATION PROBLEM OURSELVES. IN ORDER TO
INTRDUCE TECHNOLOGY FROM OTHER COUNTRIES, WE MUST
EXPORT. OIL IS THE MAIN PRODUCT. WE ARE TRYING TO

EXPORT MOREBUT THIS MUST BE INCREASED STEP-BY-STEP.
THE JAPANESE HAVE TOLD US WE HAVE 55 BILLION TONS IN

OIL DEPOSITS. I ASKED WHERE WE CAN GET SO MUCH. I ASKED
BUSH WHEN HE WAS HERE SINCE HE WAS DIRECTOR OFTHE CIA,

DID IT COME FROM THE SKY? (LAUGHTER) HE SAID IT MIGHT
BE POSSIBLE (LAUGHTER).

ANY MESSAGES YOU WANT TO GIVE US?

CHAIRMAN CHU TEH. DO YOU SMOKE? HELP YOURSELVES.

YES INDEED, LAST YEAR THE GANG OF FOUR WAS RAMPANT AND
CAUSED SABOTAGE IN MANY FIELDS.

WE HAVE BEEN REASSURED ABOUT YOUR RECOVERY. WE ARE
INTERESTED IN LEARNING ABOUT YOUR PLANS FOR ECONOMIC

DEVELOPMENT, SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY AND MODERNIZATION.

DURING THE LAST TEN YEARS, THESE FIELDS EXPERIENCED

SABOTAGE BY THE GANG OF FOUR. THE GANG OF FOUR IS IN
THE SAME CATEGORY AS LIN PAIO. IT WAS AT THE TIME WHEN
CHAIRMAN MAO WAS CRITICALLY ILL THAT THE UGLY FEATURES

UP THEIR ACTIVITIES TO SEIZE POWER. WHEN THEIR FEA-

TURES WERE REVEALED, WE TOOK PROMPT AND RESOLUTE ACTION
TO DEAL WITH THE GANG OF FOUR UNDER THE LEADERSHIP OF

CHAIRMAN HUA AND THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE. THIS HAS
ENABLED US TO TAKE MEASURES TO REALIZE THE FOUR MODERN-

IZATIONS. THIS WAS NOT POSSIBLE IN THE PAST. NOW WE
CAN MAKE GREAT EFFORTS. A LOT OF TIME HAS BEEN LOST.

NOW WE CAN CATCH UP AND GO FASTER. NOW THE MOST
FAVORABLE CONDITIONS ARE THE UNITY OF MINDS IN THE
LEADERSHIP AND THE MASSES' ENTHUSIASM. ACTUALLY, THE

GOAL OF THE FOUR MODERNIZATIONS -- AGRICULTURE, INDUS-
TRY, NATIONAL DEFENSE AND SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY --

WERE SET FORTH BY CHAIRMAN MAO AND ENUNCIATED BY
PREMIER CHOU EN-LAI ON MORE THAN ONE OCCASION. THESE

WERE OFFICIALLY SET FORTH BY PREMIER CHOU IN HIS
REPORT ON THE WORK OF THE GOVERNMENT IN JANUARY 1975

AT TNE NATIONAL PEOPLE'S CONGRESS (TENG
CHECKED WITH OTHERS PRESENT FOR THE EXACT DATE). THE

GANG OF FOUR OPPOSED THE FOUR MODERNIZATIONS.


9. FOR INSTANCE, LEARNING FROM THE ADVANCED EXPERIENCES









OF THE WORLD IS A PRINCIPLE OF CHAIRMAN MAO'S THAT WAS
CARRIED OUT BY PREMIER CHOU. THE GANG OF FOUR LABELED

IT ASA SLAVISH COMPRADOR PHILOSOPHY. THE CONSISTENT
POLICY OF CHAIRMAN MAO'S IS TO RELY ON OUR OWN EFFORTS.

THIS PRINCIPLE OF SELF-RELIANCE WILL BE ADHERED TO IN
THE FUTURE. BY SELF-RELIANCE, WE MEAN HAVING SELF-

CONFIDENCE. BY SELF-RELIANCE, CHAIRMAN MAO MEANT TO
RELY MAINLY ON OUR OWN EFFORTS BUT ALSO TO ABSORB THE

ADVANCED EXPERIENCE OF OTHER NATIONS. CHAIRMAN MAO
HAD A SAYING, &quot;MAKE FOREIGN THINGS SERVE CHINA&quot;. WE

SHOULD ALSO CREATE SOMETHING. ONE OTHER ASPECT OF
SELF-RELIANCE IS THAT WE SHOULD BUILD UP BY OUR OWN

US BY TAKING ADVANTAGE OF OUR DEBTS TO TURN CHINA INTO

WE SAY THAT THE SOVIET UNION TURNED FROM THE FIRST
SOCIALIST COUNTRY INTO A SOCIAL-IMPERIALIST COUNTRY.

THIS IS DRAWN FROM THE EXPERIENCES OF THE WORLD SITU-
ATION AND FROM OUR OWN EXPERIENCE. WE HAVE BUILT THE

BASIS FOR THE FOUR MODERNIZATIONS IN AGRICULTURE,
INDUSTRY, NATIONAL DEFENSE AND SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY

SINCE LIBERATION.

THE SOVIET UNION ACTED IN BAD FAITH BY WITHDRAWING ITS

EXPERTS AND TORE UP THE PLANS FOR INDUSTRIAL PROJECTS.
IN THE EARLY DAYS OF THE FOUNDING OF THE PEOPLE'S

REPUBLIC OF CHINA, THE SOVIET UNION PROMISED US
SOMETHING WHICH WAS WITHDRAWN BY KHRUSHCHEV. THE WEST,

EFFORTS. WE WILL ACT ACCORDING TO PRINCIPLES LAID

FOUR OBSTRUCTION IN 1974 AND THE PROPOSAL TO RAISE
WAGES DID NOT SUCCEED. IN 1975, THE SAME PROPOSAL WAS

MADE AND IT FAILED AGAIN BECAUSE OF THE GANG OF FOUR.
WE ARE NOW WORKING OUT A RAISE FOR CERTAIN CATEGORIES

OF LOWER LEVEL WAGE EARNERS. THIS INVOLVES A LOT OF PEOPLE.
WITH GROWTH IN THE NATIONAL ECONOMY, WE WILL

FREQUENTLY RAISE WAGES, ESPECIALLY LOW WAGES. AS OUR
ECONOMY IS NOT DEVELOPED, EVEN IF WE ADJUST WAGES, OUR

POLICY IS ONE OF LOW WAGES. EVEN IF WE WANT TO RAISE
WAGES, IT HAS TO BE DONE STEP-BY-STEP. THEY CANNOT

BE RAISED TOO HIGH; THE STATE MUST HAVE ACCUMULATION
OF FUNDS FOR CONSTRUCTION AND THERE SHOULD NOT BE

A GAP BETWEEN WORKERS AND PEASANTS.


19. ART ROSEN: I WOULD LIKE TO NOTE THAT THE PEOPLE'S
REPUBLIC OF CHINA HAS HAD A NUMBER OF EXHIBITIONS IN

THE UNITED STATES INCLUDING THE ARCHEOLOGICAL EXHIBI-
TION, THE HUHSIEN PAINTERS, PERFORMING ARTS TROUPES.

WE ARE ALSO PREPARING TO RECEIVE A TROUPE THAT WILL BE
MAKING A FIVE STATE TOUR. OTHER DELEGATIONS HAVE COME

TO THE UNITED SATES AND THE MOST IMPORTANT WAS THE
CHINESE PEOPLE'S INSTITUTE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS WHICH

VISITED FOR THREE WEEKS. WE BELIEVE AND HOPE THEY
RETURNED WITH A DEEPER UNDERSTANDING OF THE UNITED

STATES. WE BELIEVE AMERICAN EXHIBITIOS IN CHINA AND
PERFORMING ARTS TROUPES FROM THE US WOULD ALSO BE
BENEFICIAL. WE BELIEVE MORE CULTURAL EXCHANGES CAN










IMPROVE UNDERSTANDING AN THE CLIMATE FOR NORMALIZATION
THESE RESTRICTIONS ON THE NUMBER OOF EXCHANGES IN TURN

RESTRICTS THE CLIMATE FOR NORMALIZATION.


20. TENG: WELL, WE CAN STUDY THIS PROBLEM. THERE
IS EVERY ADVANTAGE IN HAVING EXCHANGES AND NO HARM AT

ALL.

21. LUCIEN PYE: I WOULD LIKE TO ASK ABOUT EDUCATION

POLICY, SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY AND ENTRANCE FROM
MIDDLE SCHOOLS DIRECTLY INTO COLLEGE. WHAT PROPORTION

OF STUDENTS WILLGO DIRECTLY TO COLLEGE AND WHAT PRO-
PORTION DIRECTLY TO THE COUNTRYSIDE?


22. TENG: I SUPPOSE YOU HAVE READ OUR PLAN FOR RECRUIT-

MENT OF UNIVERSITY STUDENTSM.

23. PYE: YES, I HAVE.


24. TENG: FROM THIS YEAR ON, WE HAVE STARTED DIRECT
ADMISSION. ACTUALLY, THIS POLICY WAS ADVOCATED BY

CHAIRMAN MAO AND PREMIER CHOU. HE STARTED THIS POLICY
IN 1972 BUT THE GANG OF FOUR INTERFERED. THE PROPOR-

TION ADMITTED DIRECTLY TO THE UNIVERSITY CANNOT BE
LARGE. AROUND 30 PERCENT WILL BE ADMITTEDD DIRECTLY

BECAUSE THE MIDDLE SCHOOL STANDARDS ARE VERY LOW.
ACCORDING TO THE GANG OF FOUR, THE MORE PROFESSIONAL

EXPERTISE YOU HAVE, THE MORE REACTIONARY YOU ARE.
THIS IS ABSURD. IF WE RECRUIT STUDENTS DIRECTLY AND

COMPLETELY FROM THE MIDDLE SCHOOL, WE CANNOT INSURE THE
QUALITY. WE MUST ALSO RECRUIT FROM AMONG THE SELF-

STANDARDS OF THE MIDDLE SCHOOLS IMPROVE. STUDENTS

STILL MUST DO MANUAL LABOR BUT THIS WILL BE DONE MORE

25. YOST: I WOULD LIKE TO ASK A QUESTION ABOUT

SOUTHEAST ASIA. I HAVE BEEN IN SOUTHEAST ASIA AND
EARLIER THIS YEAR I VISITED VIETNAM AND LAOS WITH

AMBASSADOR WOODCOCK. I NOTICED THAT THE CAMBODIAN
PRIME MINISTER VISITED CHINA. WE IN THE UNITED STATES

HAVE NO CONTACT WITH CAMBODIA. I WOULD APPRECIATE
YOUR COMMENTS ON SOUTHEAST ASIA.


26. TENG: IN SOUTHEAST ASIA, WE HAVE PRETTY GOOD
RELATIONS WITH CAMBODIA. WE ALSO HAVE GOOD RELATIONS

WITH LAOS AND VIETNAM. AS FOR THE FIVE COUNTRIES OF
ASEAN, WE SUPPORT THEIR PROPOSAL FOR CREATING A ZONE

OF PEACE IN SOUTHEAAST ASIA. WE HAVE ASSISTED ALL THE
INDOCHINA COUNTRIES. VIETNAM GETS THE MOST. IT

FOUGHT A WAR WITH YOU. OUR AID WAS GREATER THAN THE
SOVIET UNION'S DURING THE WAR. IN CAMBODIA, OUR AID

WAS VERY LITTLE. IT WAS ISOLATED GEOGRAPHICALLY AND
CONFIDENTIAL


CONFIDENTIAL


PAGE 02    PEKING 02447 03 OF 03 250509Z


IT WAS DIFFICULT TO TRANSPORT AID THERE. SO THE

CAMBODIANS RELIED ON THEIR OWN EFFORTS. EVEN NOW, OUR
ASSISTANCE TO VIETNAM IS LARGER THAN CAMBODIA AND LAOS.
WE APPRECIATE THE POLICY OF THE CAMBODIANS. THEY DON'T

RAISE MANY QUESTIONS FOR ASSISTANCE. WE KNOW THEY ARE
DOING WELL, ESPECIALLY IN AGRICULTURE.


27. YOST: LAST MARCH WHEN I WAS IN SOUTHEAST ASIA,

THEREWAS MUCH CONCERN OVER THE CAMBODIAN-THAI AND
CAMBODIA-VIETNAMESE BORDER TENSION. IS IT QUIETER

NOW? IS THERE STILL CONCERN?


28. TENG: RECENTLY WE HAVE HAD NO CONTACTS WITH LAOS.
BUT PRIME MINISTER POL POT VISITED RECENTLY AND WE

LEARNED SOM INFORMATION FROM THIS. WE KNOW THAILAND'S









ATTITUDE. BOTH SIDES WANT TO SETTLE THIS QUESTION IN
THE PROPER WAY. WE SUPPORT THESE EFFORTS. WE NOTE

THAT BOTH SIDES THINK THIS IS A MINOR MATTER. THE
IMPORTANT THING IS THE IMPROVEMENT OF RELATIONS.


29. HENRY SAILOR: YOU HAVE MADE EFFORTS AT CONTROLLING

YOUR POPULATION. IS ZERO POPULATION GROWTH POSSIBLE?
DO YOU CONSIDER IT AN IMPORTANT GOAL?


30. TENG: IT WILL BE DIFFICULT TO REACH THE GOAL OF

ZERO POPULATION GROWTH (TENG LAUGHS), BUT WE HOPE WE
CAN ATTAIN THIS GOAL. MUCH WORK IS REQUIRED IN THE

COUNTRYSIDE BECAUSE THERRE HASBEEN A TRADITION SINCE
ANCIENT TIMES THAT BIG FAMILIES ARE PREFERRED. THERE

HAS BEEN SUCCESS IN A NUMBER OF AREAS. THINGS ARE
BETTER IN THECITIES. IN KIANGSU FOR EXAMPLE, POPU-

LATION GROWTH IN THE CITIESAND IN THE COUNTRYSIDE IS
BELOW ONE PERCENT. THIS IS THE DIRECTION WE ARE TAKING.

A LOT OF PROPAGANDA WORK IS NEEDED. WE SHOULD NOT

FORCE PEOPLE. BIRTH CONTROL IS FREE OF CHARGE. ANYWAY,
GIGANTIC EFFORTS ARE REQUIRED. (TENG LAUGHS).


31. YOST: IN AGRICULTURE, HINA HAS DONE VERY WELL.

DOES THE VICE PREMIER ENVISION CHANGES IN AGRICULTURAL
PRODUCTION METHODS AND COOPERATION WITH THE WORLD

COMMUNITY IN DEALING WITH THE FOOD PROBLEM ?


32. TENG: WE DO NOT FEEL SATISFIED WITH OUR AGRI-
CULTURAL PRODUCTION BUT THE POTENTIAL IS GREAT. WE

HAVE HELD TWO MEETINGS IN LEARNING FROM TACHAI IN
AGRCULTURE UNDER THE CHAIRMANSHIP OF HUA KUO-FENG.

IF ONE THIRD OF OUR COUNTRIES CAN BE TUNED INTO
TACHAI-TYPE COUNTIES, THE FOOD PROBLEM WILL NOT ONLY

BE SOLVED THERE WILL BE A BIG SURPLUS. WE ARE STEPPING
UP OUR EFFORTS TO MECAHNIZE AGRICULTURE. IT IS

POSSIBLE TO REALIZE OUR PLANS IN AGRICULTURE. IN
TERMS O EXCHANGES, CHINA LEARNS FROM THE GOOD EXPERIENCES

OF OTHERS AS WELL. BUT THERE ARE DIFFERENT CHARACTERIS-
TICS IN CHINA, DIFFERENT FROM OTHERS, EVEN THE UNITED STATES.

IN CHINA, EACH REGION IS DIFFERENT. I WILL
GIVE YOU A STATISTIC. 7.5 PEOPLE SHARE ONE HECTARE OF

LAND IN CHINA. BUT IN KWANGTUNG, 17 OR 18 PEOPLE SHARE
ONE HECTARE. SO OUR PROBLEMS ARE QQUITE DIFFERENT THAN

YOURS. IN ORDER TO RAISE MORE GRAIN FROM SUCH SMALL
PLOTS, WE HAVE TO RELY ON OUR OWN EFFORTS. BUT THIS

DOESN'T MEAN WE WILL NOT LEARN FROM FOREIGN COUNTRIES,
ESPECIALLY IN SEEDS, CHEMICAL FERTILIZERS AND OTHER
QUESTIONS. MECHANIZATION ALONE CANNOT SOLVE THE PROB-










LEM. WE HAVE TO DO INTENSIVE FARMING AND SEVERAL
CROPS A YEAR IN THE SOUTH.


33. YOST: THERE IS AN UNDERSTANDING IN THE WEST THAT

TECHNOLOGY CANNOT BE TRANSFERRED EASILY TO OTHER COUN-
TRIES. I DON'T WANT TO IMPOSE TOO LONG. IF I MAY

PAGE 04    PEKING 02447 03 OF 03 250509Z


ASK ONE MORE QUESTION ON THE ECONOMY. WE JUST VISITED

AN OIL REFINERY. DOES THE VICE PREMIER BELIEVE THE
PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA WILL BE ABLE TO XPORT A

SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF OIL PRODUCTS OR WILL MOST OF IT
BE USED FOR DOMESTIC CONSUMPTION? THIS IS AN IMPORTANT

INTERNATIONAL QUESTION BECAUSE OF THE SERIOUS ENERGY
CRISIS.


34. TENG: WE ARE PREPARED TO EXPORT MORE OIL PRODUCTS.

WE CAN DO THAT. ACCORDING TO OUR OWN STATISTICS, WE
HAVE LARGE OIL DEPOSITS. WE ARE BASICALLY ABLE TO

SOLVE THE EXPLORATION PROBLEM OURSELVES. IN ORDER TO
INTRDUCE TECHNOLOGY FROM OTHER COUNTRIES, WE MUST
EXPORT. OIL IS THE MAIN PRODUCT. WE ARE TRYING TO

EXPORT MOREBUT THIS MUST BE INCREASED STEP-BY-STEP.
THE JAPANESE HAVE TOLD US WE HAVE 55 BILLION TONS IN

OIL DEPOSITS. I ASKED WHERE WE CAN GET SO MUCH. I ASKED
BUSH WHEN HE WAS HERE SINCE HE WAS DIRECTOR OFTHE CIA,

DID IT COME FROM THE SKY? (LAUGHTER) HE SAID IT MIGHT
BE POSSIBLE (LAUGHTER).


35. YOST: WE ARE OPTIMISTIC. WE DON'T WANT TO IMPOSE.

ANY MESSAGES YOU WANT TO GIVE US?


36. TENG: SPITTING DURING TRANSLATION): AS I HAVE
SAID, MUTUAL EXCHANGES ARE USEFUL. YOU ARE ENTHUSIASTIC

TO PROMOTE RELATIONS BETWEEN CHINA AND THE UNITED
STATES. I WISH TO THANK YOU. I HOPE RELATIONS CAN BE

NORMALIZED AT AN EARLY DATE.

REMARKED TO TENG THAT SHE HOPED TO SEE HIM IN THE
UNITED STATES. TENG: AFTER NORMALIZATION, I WILL BE
