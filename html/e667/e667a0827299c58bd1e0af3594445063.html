		<h3>Tor</h3>
		<p><a href="https://www.torproject.org">Tor</a> is an encrypted anonymising network that makes it harder to intercept internet communications, or see where communications are coming from or going to.</p>
		<p>In order to use the WikiLeaks public submission system as detailed above you can download the Tor Browser Bundle, which is a Firefox-like browser available for Windows, Mac OS X and GNU/Linux and pre-configured to connect using the anonymising system Tor.</p>
		<h4>Tails</h4>
		<p>If you are at high risk and you have the capacity to do so, you can also access the submission system through a secure operating system called <a href="https://tails.boum.org">Tails</a>. Tails is an operating system launched from a USB stick or a DVD that aim to leaves no traces when the computer is shut down after use and automatically routes your internet traffic through Tor. Tails will require you to have either a USB stick or a DVD at least 4GB big and a laptop or desktop computer.</p>

		<h3>Tips</h3>
		<p>Our submission system works hard to preserve your anonymity, but we recommend you also take some of your own precautions. Please review these basic guidelines. </p>
		<div>
			<h4>1. Contact us if you have specific problems</h4>
			<p>If you have a very large submission, or a submission with a complex format, or are a high-risk source, please <a href="#submit_help_contact">contact us</a>. In our experience it is always possible to find a custom solution for even the most seemingly difficult situations.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h4>2. What computer to use</h4>
			<p>If the computer you are uploading from could subsequently be audited in an investigation, consider using a computer that is not easily tied to you. Technical users can also use <a href="https://tails.boum.org">Tails</a> to help ensure you do not leave any records of your submission on the computer.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h4>3. Do not talk about your submission to others</h4>
			<p>If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in source protection – it is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This includes other media organisations.</p>
		</div>

	</div>
</div>

<div id="submit_help_after" class="submit_elem">

			</div>
		</div>

		<h3>After</h3>

		<div>
			<h4>1. Do not talk about your submission to others</h4>
			<p>If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in source protection – it is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This includes other media organisations.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h4>2. Act normal</h4>
			<p>If you are a high-risk source, avoid saying anything or doing anything after submitting which might promote suspicion. In particular, you should try to stick to your normal routine and behaviour.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h4>3. Remove traces of your submission</h4>
			<p>If you are a high-risk source and the computer you prepared your submission on, or uploaded it from, could subsequently be audited in an investigation, we recommend that you format and dispose of the computer hard drive and any other storage media you used.</p>
			<p>In particular, hard drives retain data after formatting which may be visible to a digital forensics team and flash media (USB sticks, memory cards and SSD drives) retain data even after a secure erasure. If you used flash media to store sensitive data, it is important to destroy the media.</p>
			<p>If you do this and are a high-risk source you should make sure there are no traces of the clean-up, since such traces themselves may draw suspicion.</p>
			<div>
				<h4>4. If you face legal action</h4>
				<p>If a legal action is brought against you as a result of your submission, there are organisations that may help you. The Courage Foundation is an international organisation dedicated to the protection of journalistic sources. You can find more details at <a href="https://www.couragefound.org">https://www.couragefound.org</a>.</p>

		<p>WikiLeaks publishes documents of political or historical importance that are censored or otherwise suppressed. We specialise in strategic global publishing and large archives.</p>
		<p>The following is the address of our secure site where you can anonymously upload your documents to WikiLeaks editors. You can only access this submissions system through Tor. (See our <a href="#submit_help_tor">Tor tab</a> for more information.) We also advise you to read our <a href="#submit_help_tips">tips for sources</a> before submitting.</p>

   INSIDE OF 40,000<br />
   MIDDLE CLASS IN RUSSIA IS SHRINKIN<br />
   Author: Yelena Zibrova<br />
   [Middle class in Russia is down from 15% to 11%.]<br />
<br />
         Rosgosstrakh's Center for Strategic Studies conducted a<br />
   survey and discovered that the Russians regarded 40,000 a month an<br />
   adequate salary ensuring decent living standards. Center officials<br />
   approached 19,000 Russians throughout the country in September and<br />
   October. Only 14% of the latter called their income fine. The<br />
   group of those confident that they would never earn 40,000 rubles<br />
   meanwhile dwindled from 47% to 38%. Respondents suggested that<br />
   42,000 rubles had constituted a decent salary in spring 2008.<br />
   &quot;This change in income evaluation stems from the crash in the real<br />
   estate market and surplus consumption reduction,&quot; specialists<br />
   said.<br />
         Life was discovered to be particularly expensive in Moscow.<br />
   The Muscovites said 62,000 rubles a month were the sum necessary<br />
   for adequate living standards. Moscow was followed by<br />
   Yekaterinburg where the necessary sum was estimated at 45,000<br />
   rubles. The minimum income in Nizhny Novgorod and St.Petersburg<br />
   was evaluated at 41,000 rubles.<br />
         Fourteen percent respondents said they were making adequate<br />
   money and 33% expressed confidence in their ability to start<br />
   making it within three years. At the same time, 38% said that they<br />
   would never earn a reasonably decent income (they had numbered 47%<br />
   three years ago).<br />
         &quot;The Russians are convinced that their labor is undervalued.<br />
   Average monthly pay in Moscow is 40,000 rubles and the Muscovites<br />
   want 60,000. Average monthly pay throughout the rest of the<br />
   country is 18,000 rubles or so but the Russians want 20,000,&quot; said<br />
   Sergei Smirnov, Director of the Institute of Social Policy and<br />
   Socioeconomic Programs of the Supreme School of Economics.<br />
         Judging by the Rosgosstrakh's study, the middle class in<br />
   Russia society dwindled from 15% to 11%.<br />

   Russia reports first swine flu deaths<br />
<br />
   CHITA, October 27 (RIA Novosti) - Two women<br />
   diagnosed with swine flu have died in eastern<br />
   Siberia's Chita, the regional governor's press service said on Tuesday.<br />
<br />
   &quot;Two women are believed to have died of the<br />
   A/H1N1 virus,&quot; the spokesman said, adding that<br />
   official confirmation of the causes of death<br />
   would only be available in 21 days.<br />
<br />
   One of the victims, a 29-year-old woman, was<br />
   pregnant. Doctors were unable to save the baby.<br />
<br />
   Russia's top sanitary official said the woman was<br />
   hospitalized with swine flu and pneumonia and<br />
   died on October 19, and the other victim, a<br />
   50-year-old patient, died in hospital on October 22.<br />
<br />
   Gennady Onishchenko also said there were more<br />
   than 1,300 confirmed swine flu cases across Russia as of October 26.<br />
<br />
   Russia plans to start a swine flu vaccination<br />
   program in December. Ten million people - medical<br />
   staff, employees at electric power and water<br />
   treatment plants and other facilities - will be<br />
   given flu jabs in the first instance. Another 30<br />
   million will be vaccinated if the virus spreads.<br />

   A Hypnotizing Hunt Leaves Russians Bewildered<br />
   By ELLEN BARRY<br />
<br />
   MOSCOW A Earlier this month, a sodden and<br />
   unshaven man emerged from the woods near the<br />
   southern Russian village of Goryachy Klyuch,<br />
   telling rescuers he spent three nights perched in<br />
   trees to get away from jackals.<br />
<br />
   A similar tale came from the taiga near Bratsk,<br />
   in Siberia, where a 22-year-old man wandered for<br />
   five days, covering himself with pine boughs at<br />
   night to ward off frostbite. Eleven time zones to<br />
   the west, near the Baltic Sea, a search and<br />
   rescue team found an elderly couple in a swamp<br />
   where they had spent the night, the wife in what<br />
   officials described as a**a state of panic.a**<br />
<br />
   It happens every mushroom season. Russians are<br />
   passionate about gathering mushrooms, an ancient<br />
   pastime they call the a**quiet hunt,a** and routinely<br />
   become so hypnotized that they get hopelessly<br />
   lost. Regional search-and-rescue teams fan out on<br />
   foot or in helicopters, occasionally enlisting<br />
   tracking dogs or parachute jumpers, and<br />
   newspapers retell their stories with gusto.<br />
<br />
   Fall has drawn Russians into the forest for too<br />
   many centuries to count. Even hardened urbanites<br />
   whisper endearments to the wood spirits before<br />
   turning their eyes to the ground, a gesture to<br />
   their pagan ancestors. But Aleksandr Kuznetsov,<br />
   who founded an online a**mushroomersa** club,a** said<br />
   he believed that Russiansa** sense of the natural<br />
   world had dulled over the generations, leaving<br />
   them too often disoriented in the woods.<br />
<br />
   a**People are leaning on technology, forgetting<br />
   that nature is still nature,a** said Mr. Kuznetsov,<br />
   a Muscovite, whose Web site advertises a mobile<br />
   global positioning system as a**the mushroomera**s best friend.a**<br />
<br />
   a**Civilization carries a certain negative side,<br />
   and people are losing their natural instincts,a**<br />
   he added. a**They are city people now.a**<br />
<br />
   City people or not, they creep out with wicker<br />
   baskets at dawn, when mist is still rising from<br />
   the earth, looking for humid, sun-warmed spots<br />
   where mushrooms have risen overnight. True<br />
   devotees are unapologetically competitive, hiding<br />
   their secrets from the neighbors and slyly<br />
   covering their baskets with cloth when someone<br />
   approaches. At its best, mushroom hunting is a<br />
   trance state, blotting out everyday concerns like<br />
   the passage of time, or the way home.<br />
<br />
   Herein lies the problem. Russiaa**s Ministry of<br />
   Emergency Situations does not keep statistics on<br />
   lost mushroomers, and a spokeswoman said the<br />
   number of the missing was so small as to be statistically irrelevant.<br />
<br />
   But reports trickle out from regional rescue<br />
   services throughout the fall: The western region<br />
   of Kaluga conducted 21 searches for mushroom<br />
   hunters, of whom seven were brought to safety,<br />
   five were found dead and nine were still missing.<br />
<br />
   Perm reported 11; Irkutsk had carried out 35 by late August.<br />
<br />
   Aleksandr Zmanovsky, who leads a rescue team near<br />
   Bratsk, said nearly every year someone goes into<br />
   the wild and is never found A often because of<br />
   bears, who so thoroughly bury the remains of a<br />
   body that a**we will never find anything.a**<br />
<br />
   An older generation knew how to navigate by the angle of the light, he<br />
   said.<br />
<br />
   a**If a person just puts on his sneakers and goes<br />
   into the taiga, or someone drives him there and<br />
   he doesna**t know where he is, then of course he<br />
   gets lost,a** Mr. Zmanovsky said. a**I call those<br />
   people the children of asphalt, those who grew up<br />
   in the city. People who grew up in villages, they dona**t get lost.a**<br />
<br />
   One such case drew a flurry of attention to<br />
   Nizhnaya Salda, a city of 17,000 in the Urals.<br />
<br />
   Late in September, a 37-year-old woman named<br />
   Irina Fedyno returned home a full 24 days after<br />
   she had gone out mushroom picking, and more than<br />
   two weeks after a search-and-rescue effort had been called off.<br />
<br />
   Ms. Fedynoa**s hair-raising survival story spread<br />
   as far as the Moscow tabloid Komsomolskaya<br />
   Pravda, which quoted her description of the<br />
   forest, where a**from one side, there was shooting A from the other,<br />
   howling.a**<br />
<br />
   A local journalist took a skeptical view, writing<br />
   in The City Herald that Ms. Fedyno a**appeared<br />
   completely fresh, not emaciated, after her 24<br />
   days in the woods.a** Kseniya Vashchenko, a City<br />
   Herald journalist, said that a**in our law<br />
   enforcement organs, there is some basis for<br />
   believing that she spent the time with, how should I put it, her<br />
   friend.a**<br />
<br />
   In an interview, Ms. Fedyno fumed at the rumors<br />
   that she had a**gone on a bender.a** Her husband,<br />
   Alexei Sitnikov, was equally indignant, saying<br />
   that his wife returned home so smelly that after<br />
   her ordeal she was ashamed to go to the hospital.<br />
   He said that she tore up her blouse to wrap<br />
   around her wounded feet, adding. a**it was a nice<br />
   blouse, too,a** and that when she ran into his arms<br />
   on her return to him, she was so light that he<br />
   could have thrown her up to the ceiling.<br />
<br />
   He said he was overjoyed to have her home.<br />
<br />
   a**I thought I would never see Irinka again,a** he<br />
   said. a**Twenty days. Nobody can stay alive in the<br />
   forest that long. But she survived. I believed,<br />
   and I waited, and finally she was home.a**<br />

   Kremlin warns against wrecking Russia with democracy<br />
   By Guy Faulconbridge<br />
   October 26, 2009<br />
   [DJ: You can read the Surkov interview here:<br />
   http://www.itogi.ru/russia/2009/44/145418.html ]<br />
<br />
   MOSCOW (Reuters) - The Kremlin's chief political<br />
   strategist warned in an article published on<br />
   Monday that Russia risked collapsing into chaos<br />
   if officials tried to tinker with the political<br />
   system by flirting with liberal reforms.<br />
<br />
   Kremlin Deputy Chief of Staff Vladislav Surkov<br />
   said it was clear Russia was falling behind in<br />
   many areas of economic development and that the<br />
   country could not simply continue being a &quot;resource power.&quot;<br />
<br />
   But in answer to calls from opponents for<br />
   democratic reforms to liberalize the political<br />
   system built under former President Vladimir<br />
   Putin, Surkov warned that the resulting instability could rip Russia<br />
   apart.<br />
<br />
   &quot;Even now when power is rather consolidated and<br />
   ordered, many projects are very slow and<br />
   difficult,&quot; Surkov was quoted as saying by the Itogi weekly magazine.<br />
<br />
   &quot;If we add any sort of political instability to<br />
   that then our development would simply be<br />
   paralyzed. There would be a lot of demagoguery, a<br />
   lot of empty talk, a lot of lobbying and ripping<br />
   Russia to pieces, but no development.&quot;<br />
<br />
   As the Kremlin's point man on domestic politics,<br />
   Surkov rarely speaks in public.<br />
<br />
   Surkov, 45, is viewed by diplomats and investors<br />
   as one of Russia's most powerful officials and is<br />
   credited with helping Putin to craft the<br />
   Kremlin's centralized political system after the chaos of the 1990s.<br />
<br />
   He worked for Putin's entire eight-year<br />
   presidency in the Kremlin as a deputy chief of<br />
   staff and continued under Putin's protege, President Dmitry Medvedev.<br />
<br />
   Medvedev, who took power in May 2008, has<br />
   repeatedly stressed the need for Russia to open<br />
   up and modernize its political system.<br />
<br />
   But opponents say he has made few changes to the<br />
   tightly controlled system he inherited from<br />
   Putin, who continues to serve as prime minister.<br />
<br />
   After disputed October 11 regional elections,<br />
   which official results showed Putin's United<br />
   Russia party won with a landslide, opposition<br />
   parties have called for electoral reforms and a rerun of the vote.<br />
<br />
   &quot;We must not confuse liberal, democratic society<br />
   with chaos and disorder,&quot; Surkov said, adding<br />
   that Russia should avoid the excesses of both<br />
   Chinese leader Mao Zedong and Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet.<br />
<br />
   &quot;Though Mao Zedong said that a lot of chaos<br />
   results in a lot of order, he probably meant that<br />
   tough or even totalitarian regimes are born from<br />
   ruins. We do not need that. We do not need a Pinochet,&quot; Surkov said.<br />
<br />
   Surkov graduated in economics and served in the<br />
   Soviet army before working as a public relations<br />
   and advertising consultant in the 1990s,<br />
   including for tycoons such as Mikhail Fridman and<br />
   the now disgraced oil tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovsky.<br />
<br />
   &quot;We must understand that authority that is<br />
   unconsolidated and unbalanced (and) weak<br />
   democratic institutions are unable to ensure an economic revival,&quot; Surkov<br />
   said.<br />

   Russia: Surkov's Busy Week<br />
<br />
   STRATFOR sources have said Russian President<br />
   Dmitri Medvedev's Deputy Chief of Staff Vladislav<br />
   Surkov's schedule for the coming week is full of<br />
   meetings with some of Russia's most influential<br />
   politicians and business figures. Trouble has<br />
   been brewing inside the Kremlin lately and<br />
   STRATFOR has been watching for any indications<br />
   that the groundwork for potentially monumental<br />
   shifts in the country's economic and political landscape is being laid.<br />
<br />
   Surkov is not simply Medvedev's deputy chief of<br />
   staff. He is also first aide to Prime Minister<br />
   Vladimir Putin -- who wields the real power in<br />
   Moscow -- and leader of one of the two major<br />
   clans inside the Kremlin. Surkov is also capable<br />
   of delivering messages from either himself or the<br />
   Kremlin with the proper authority while packaging them in political<br />
   eloquence.<br />
<br />
   According to STRATFOR's sources, Surkov will be<br />
   meeting with members of the Duma, top politicians<br />
   and business leaders to lay out the changes that<br />
   will be ushered in under Finance Minister Alexei<br />
   Kudrin's economic reform plan (the details of<br />
   which can be found here). In an effort to<br />
   mentally and rhetorically distance Kudrin's plans<br />
   from the catastrophic liberal reforms of the<br />
   1990s, Surkov is billing Kudrin's reforms as the<br />
   &quot;evolution of modernization.&quot; While Surkov will<br />
   be detailing what is to come, he will also be<br />
   conveying the message that dissent will not be<br />
   tolerated. Surkov's job will be to lay out the<br />
   expectations while making sure everyone falls in line.<br />
<br />
   That these meetings have been scheduled at all<br />
   means that Putin has given his consent on at<br />
   least part of the plan formulated by Kudrin and<br />
   the rest of the civiliki, a rising group of<br />
   intellectuals and technocrats within Surkov's<br />
   clan (including Medvedev). It is unclear what<br />
   aspects or how much of Kudrin's plan Putin has<br />
   approved. STRATFOR will be watching for any<br />
   response from the targets of Kudrin's reforms --<br />
   members of the rival clan led by Deputy Prime<br />
   Minister Igor Sechin. But the balance appears to<br />
   be shifting in favor of Surkov's clan, Kudrin and the civiliki.<br />
<br />
   The next question is whether Putin has approved<br />
   Surkov's politicization of Kudrin's plan in which<br />
   members of Sechin's group would be stripped of<br />
   much of their economic power. STRATFOR will be<br />
   breaking down Surkov's plan in the fourth part of<br />
   The Kremlin Wars Special Series on Oct. 27.<br />

   Medvedev asks top election official to draw lesson from recent election<br />
<br />
         GORKI.  Oct 27 (Interfax) - President Dmitry Medvedev has urged the<br />
   Central Election Commission to draw lessons from the October polls.<br />
         &quot;The problems and flaws uncovered must be taken into account in the<br />
   Central  Election  Commission's  further  work,&quot;  Medvedev  told Central<br />
   Election Commission head Vladimir Churov.<br />
         &quot;I  don't  mean  immediate  reaction  alone  -  this is your direct<br />
   responsibility.  I  also  mean the parties' right to turn to courts,&quot; he<br />
   said.<br />
         &quot;Our  election  system is at a stage of development and it is quite<br />
   young. General  and  direct elections with secret ballots have a history<br />
   of just 20 years in this country,&quot; Medvedev said.<br />
         Even  in  countries with accomplished democracies electoral systems<br />
   are undergoing  changes,  the  Russian  president  said.  &quot;The rules are<br />
   changing  and  so are technologies. We must be reasonably conservative,&quot;<br />
   he said.<br />
         Medvedev  said he would make proposals, as he will be preparing his<br />
   address  to  the Federal Assembly, which the Central Election Commission<br />
   should take into account.<br />

   Uproar Over Election Fraud Ends in a Fizzle<br />
   By Nikolaus von Twickel<br />
<br />
   Two weeks after the unprecedented walkout of the<br />
   State Dumaa**s three opposition parties, little<br />
   seems left of the whiff of democracy that surfaced so suddenly.<br />
<br />
   President Dmitry Medvedev appeared to yield to<br />
   their demands over the weekend, meeting with<br />
   leaders of the Just Russia, Liberal Democrat and<br />
   the Communist parties to discuss Oct. 11 regional<br />
   elections that they say were blatantly falsified<br />
   in favor of the ruling United Russia party.<br />
<br />
   But the outcome of Saturdaya**s talks resembled a<br />
   fizzle after the uproar that led to it: Medvedev<br />
   declared that the country was moving forward on<br />
   the path of democracy and that he was open to<br />
   changing election laws favoring United Russia.<br />
   And opposition party leaders said they were happy with that.<br />
<br />
   The Kremlin also downplayed the meetinga**s<br />
   emergency character, rebranding it as a routine<br />
   roundtable between the president and the heads of<br />
   the Dumaa**s four factions, including United<br />
   Russia, that had been originally scheduled for Tuesday.<br />
<br />
   Medvedev also placed the disputed elections low<br />
   on the agenda, focusing rather on the countrya**s<br />
   proposals to the Group of 20 and his planned state-of-the-nation address.<br />
<br />
   The result seemed to give credence to skepticsa**<br />
   claims that the Duma walkout was a Kremlin-orchestrated affair.<br />
<br />
   a**This was just a demonstration to make us believe<br />
   that apparently we have democracy and democratic<br />
   procedures,a** Ilya Yashin, a leading member of the<br />
   Solidarity opposition movement, told The Moscow Times.<br />
<br />
   All participants of Saturdaya**s meeting were<br />
   positive about it afterward, and even Liberal<br />
   Democratic Party leader Vladimir Zhirinovsky, who<br />
   led the Oct. 14 walkout, said he thought it was a**excellent.a**<br />
<br />
   Yashin said this merely showed that the Duma<br />
   opposition parties had been co-opted by the<br />
   Kremlin. a**These are systemic parties that<br />
   coordinate their actions with the presidential administration,a** he said.<br />
<br />
   The opposition factions have denied working with the Kremlin in the past.<br />
<br />
   Yashin said Medvedev should not be judged by his<br />
   words but by his actions. a**He has been president<br />
   1 1/2 years, and he is effectively continuing the<br />
   tough course set by Putin, despite his talk about liberalization,a** he<br />
   said.<br />
<br />
   Dmitry Oreshkin, an analyst with the Mercator<br />
   think tank, said Medvedeva**s words ultimately mattered little.<br />
<br />
   a**What he said is absolutely unimportant. What is<br />
   important is that three loyal, systemic<br />
   opposition parties suddenly and publicly<br />
   demonstrated that the elections were rigged. That<br />
   is a new feature in politics,a** he said.<br />
<br />
   But Oreshkin refuted the idea that the walkout<br />
   had been orchestrated, calling it the<br />
   a**spontaneous actiona** of parties who are fearful<br />
   of losing political representation in the future.<br />
<br />
   He said the scandal ultimately had to fade away<br />
   like it did because Medvedev could not dismantle<br />
   the system set up by his predecessor and mentor,<br />
   Prime Minister Vladimir Putin. a**He can just<br />
   express his sympathy. Thata**s all,a** he said.<br />
<br />
   Oleg Shein, a Duma deputy with A Just Russia who<br />
   was a leading advocate of the walkout after<br />
   losing the mayoral election in his native<br />
   Astrakhan against the incumbent from United<br />
   Russia, said the Kremlin needed to act against vote-rigging in the<br />
   regions.<br />
<br />
   a**If they do not act now, regional bureaucrats,<br />
   and not the federal center, will set the agenda<br />
   one year from now,a** he said Monday, speaking by telephone from<br />
   Astrakhan.<br />
<br />
   a**It is very important to understand that stability depends on this,a**<br />
   he said.<br />
<br />
   Regional leaders like Mayor Yury Luzhkov and<br />
   Dagestani President Mukhu Aliyev found themselves<br />
   in the hot seat after the opposition and even<br />
   senior officials claimed massive fraud in the Oct. 11 elections.<br />
<br />
   The Kremlin had urged Luzhkov in advance not to<br />
   obstruct opposition parties from running. But at<br />
   the same time, the Kremlin had made it clear that<br />
   regional bossesa** careers were linked to how<br />
   United Russia fared at the ballot box. Medvedev<br />
   has fired governors after United Russia garnered poor election results.<br />
<br />
   Luzhkov has been quick to dismiss speculation<br />
   that United Russiaa**s sweeping 66 percent victory<br />
   in Moscow City Duma elections could be used to<br />
   cripple him politically, telling reporters that<br />
   he was one of the partya**s founders and that he had no intention of<br />
   leaving.<br />

   BUSINESS AND SOCIETY: MEDVEDEV'S LIST<br />
   The October 11 election became a point of no-return<br />
   Author: Yana Yakovleva<br />
   DMITRY MEDVEDEV MANAGED TO ORGANIZE COMPILATION OF UNPROCESSED<br />
   INFORMATION ON THE GENUINE STATE OF AFFAIRS IN RUSSIA<br />
<br />
         Dmitry Medvedev's &quot;Forward, Russia!&quot; is a signal from a man<br />
   in the corridors of power who is prepared to listen to the<br />
   population. The president welcomes everyone to up and share his or<br />
   her opinion. Letters to Medvedev are written by everyone from<br />
   academicians to prisoners. This ability to listen is a major step<br />
   on the way to the ability to act.<br />
         The existing signal transmission system is arranged in such a<br />
   manner as to make sure that the signals get lost somewhere between<br />
   the sender and the recipient. Medvedev established a channel that<br />
   detours administrative barriers. It is something unprecedented. It<br />
   is something absolutely atypical of the grey mass of bureaucrats<br />
   the country is used to dealing with.<br />
         Compilation of information Medvedev has organized is<br />
   invaluable from the standpoint of checking the existing<br />
   institutions for viability. Institutions should be functional or<br />
   no reforms will ever be possible. Compilation of these signals and<br />
   their processing will take time, but even the willingness to take<br />
   the time is a breakthrough for Russia.<br />
         The October 11 election was one of the signals. The<br />
   institution of elections malfunctioned. The opportunities provided<br />
   by the administrative resource coupled with selective application<br />
   of the law sent the whole situation spinning out of control. The<br />
   impression is that October 11 became a point of no return. A good<br />
   deal of Russians lost all vestiges of trust in elections.<br />
         Party ticket in Moscow was headed by Yuri Luzhkov. That he<br />
   would turn over the mandate to someone else was always clear. Who<br />
   this &quot;someone else&quot; would be was the only question. As matters<br />
   stand, it might be just about anyone. The population does not<br />
   elect the people it wants to see in the corridors of power. It<br />
   votes for a party ticket. And who compiles it? Who are these<br />
   people? Why them? Voting for party tickets, people vote for the<br />
   lack of transparency and ultimately for corruption.<br />
         The very thesis that the Russians need some time yet to<br />
   mature to democracy strips the country of the chance for<br />
   modernization. Who will carry out this modernization?<br />
   Modernization is something that requires personalities and not<br />
   party tickets.<br />

   Russian pundits debate regional election, Medvedev's leadership<br />
   Ekho Moskvy Online<br />
   October 25, 2009<br />
<br />
   On 25 October the &quot;Polnyy Albats&quot; regular slot on<br />
   Gazprom-owned editorially-independent Ekho Moskvy<br />
   radio tried to establish what the real results of<br />
   the 11 October regional election could have been<br />
   and questioned Medvedev's credibility as president.<br />
<br />
   In his opening statement Boris Nemtsov,<br />
   well-known politician and one of the co-chairmen<br />
   of the Solidarity opposition movement, said that<br />
   the outcome of President Medvedev's meeting with<br />
   leaders of State Duma factions at Barvikha<br />
   residence was quite predictable. &quot;The country is<br />
   continuing Putin's course towards eliminating<br />
   democracy, elections, political competition and<br />
   justice. Medvedev is a nominal president. In<br />
   fact, he is neither head of state in the proper<br />
   sense of this word not a guarantor of the<br />
   constitution. I see him more like a blogger and<br />
   an essay-writer. Of course, a president can write<br />
   an occasional article but it would be good if he<br />
   acted too. I don't know any political act by<br />
   Medvedev that would not be in line with Putin's<br />
   course towards the annihilation of citizens'<br />
   rights, including the right to elect and be<br />
   elected, and it's unlikely I will ever see one,&quot; Nemtsov opined.<br />
<br />
   Later, continuing his criticism of Medvedev,<br />
   Nemtsov said that &quot;the problem is that this man<br />
   was selected by Putin on the basis of Dmitriy<br />
   Anatolyevich's quite concrete human qualities.<br />
   The qualities are as follows: he is weak, weak,<br />
   you see? Unfortunately, this is a diagnosis... He<br />
   is a weak man without a strong core, a man who,<br />
   while having enormous constitutional powers, have<br />
   not used them even once... This is his personal<br />
   tragedy, and the country's tragedy. He is a<br />
   transitory figure, he is being kept there as,<br />
   perhaps, a laughing stock because of his Internet<br />
   research, blogging activities and so on... He is<br />
   not independent, he has no willpower he is not a<br />
   president. It's a man who will undoubtedly disappear,&quot; Nemtsov said.<br />
<br />
   Commenting on what Medvedev told the faction<br />
   leaders in Barvikha to the effect that there<br />
   won't be a revision of the results and that those<br />
   unhappy about it should go to court, Kirill<br />
   Rogov, a political commentator and a researcher<br />
   from the Institute for economy in transition, had<br />
   the following to say about the president's<br />
   handling of the election controversy: &quot;Everything<br />
   is precisely the other way around. Dmitriy<br />
   Anatolyevich messed everything up. When election<br />
   results have been falsified, it's not the parties<br />
   that have been cheated but citizens.<br />
   Consequently, this is a problem for Dmitriy<br />
   Anatolyevich because he is acting as Russian<br />
   president and because he guarantees our rights,<br />
   including the right to free and fair elections.<br />
   Therefore the problem of vote rigging is his<br />
   problem which he has to investigate and examine it thoroughly.<br />
<br />
   On the contrary, he can't say that the election<br />
   results can't be cancelled because this is for<br />
   the court to decide. So he has confused<br />
   everything. He has to deal with the problem of<br />
   falsification whereas it's up for the court to<br />
   decide whether to cancel the elections or not,&quot; the pundit pointed out.<br />
<br />
   Lev Gudkov, director of Levada Centre for public<br />
   opinion studies, said that about 10 days before<br />
   the elections they carried out a poll which, in<br />
   his view, is the only reliable point of<br />
   reference. &quot;According to our data the turnout<br />
   should have been, by various estimates, from 22<br />
   to 27 per cent, that is, about 25 per cent.&quot; But<br />
   official figure was named as 35 per cent, that is<br />
   they took the figure for the year 2005 and added 1 per cent, Gudkov said.<br />
<br />
   &quot;This gap of about 10 per cent was distributed<br />
   (among the parties) if we speak about<br />
   falsifications. According to our calculations,<br />
   between 600,000-700,000 votes were added to the<br />
   ballot boxes or lists or otherwise. They were<br />
   distributed in the following fashion, it seems:<br />
   over 80 per cent went to One Russia and some went<br />
   to the Communists.&quot; Gudkov said that, on average,<br />
   ballot stuffing was about 160 to 200 voting<br />
   papers per polling station &quot;which is quite<br />
   feasible technically, even if not easy&quot;.<br />
<br />
   Lev Gudkov said that 62 per cent of those polled<br />
   expected the results to be falsified for the benefit of One Russia<br />
<br />
   Responding to the statistics quoted by the<br />
   director of Levada Centre, Kirill Rogov said that<br />
   in his view the turnout figures were slightly<br />
   higher in polls than in reality. &quot;I know from<br />
   your polls that one in four respondents thinks<br />
   that these polls may harm him because they may be<br />
   made known to the authorities. People are guided<br />
   by some kind of inertia, it's easier for them to<br />
   say that they will vote than to stop and think<br />
   whether they will vote or not. Therefore it can't<br />
   be ruled out that the turnout was lower than 25<br />
   per cent. Specifically, statistical estimates of<br />
   falsifications so much mentioned in the Internet<br />
   showed that the turnout was closer to 20 per cent.&quot;<br />
<br />
   &quot;Let's calculate therefore,&quot; Rogov went on. &quot;The<br />
   turnout was below 25 per cent. About 45 per cent<br />
   voted for One Russia in reality. So this is 9 per<br />
   cent of those who has the right to vote. Quite an impressive figure!&quot;<br />
<br />
   Boris Nemtsov summed up the discussion in the<br />
   following way: &quot;First, a turning point has been<br />
   passed. There are no elections in the country.<br />
   Second, the opportunistic policy of all the<br />
   parties officially registered by Putin's Justice<br />
   Ministry has failed. Attempt to engage in<br />
   behind-the-scene talks ended up in the results<br />
   announced triumphantly by Putin's television. And<br />
   thirdly and perhaps most importantly, all this is<br />
   taking place in an atmosphere of the total<br />
   indifference and apathy of our people who have<br />
   been made to believe that nothing depends on them.&quot;<br />

   The irreplaceable unloved<br />
   Following Russiaa**s Liberal Democratic Partya**s<br />
   call for Moscowa**s mayor to resign, a published<br />
   opinion poll shows that Muscovites believe the mayor is corrupt.<br />
   By Maksim Glikin and Natalia Kostenko<br />
<br />
   Right after the elections held October 16-19, the<br />
   Levada-center conducted an all-Russian poll on<br />
   rumors around corruption in the Moscow government<br />
   (1601 participants were interviewed). Social<br />
   scientists asked, a**Do you believe the hearsay<br />
   about Moscow mayor Yury Luzhkov being corrupt and<br />
   that he provides business assistance to his own wife, Elena Baturina?<br />
<br />
   An overwhelming majority of respondents, 61.4%,<br />
   believe this information is true: 22.7% say this<br />
   information is a**definitely truea**, while 38.7% say<br />
   it is sort of true. The answer a**definitely nota**<br />
   got 1% of the votes. In Moscow itself, the<br />
   percentage of negative answers has been even higher a** 76% overall.<br />
<br />
   Five per cent revolted against those creating the<br />
   hype on the issue while 23.1% were boiled over by<br />
   the actions of the mayor and his wife, 24.9%<br />
   welcomed the corruption probe being taken up and<br />
   for 28.4% the issue remained unnoticed.<br />
<br />
   This does not affect Yury Luzhkova**s rating<br />
   directly, notes Levada-centera**s deputy director<br />
   Aleksey Grazhdankin, as most Moskovites are still<br />
   satisfied with the mayor but, nevertheless,<br />
   people are getting tired of Mr Luzhkov and his rating is spiraling down.<br />
<br />
   In 2001, Luzhkov enjoyed good relations with 65%<br />
   of Muscovites, 24% were neutral towards him and<br />
   8% definitely disliked him. In 2005 the<br />
   proportions swung to 54:27:9, today they are 36:42:18.<br />
<br />
   On Saturday, at the meeting with the President of<br />
   Russia, the leader of LDPR, Russiaa**s Liberal<br />
   Democratic Party, Vladimir Zhirinovsky, proposed<br />
   firing the capitala**s mayor. He said that after<br />
   being in power for 20 years, Yury Luzhkov created<br />
   the most corrupt government and has been falsifying elections ever since.<br />
<br />
   The President gave no reply, but of four parties<br />
   present, three supported the idea.<br />
   A city official says that Luzhkova**s company is<br />
   well aware of the good relations between their<br />
   boss and Zhirinovsky, so if the latter made such<br />
   a proposal a** then he was asked to do so. The<br />
   declaration had been sanctioned by the<br />
   presidenta**s administration, he insists. Sergey<br />
   Tsoy, the mayora**s press-secretary, refused to comment on the issue.<br />
<br />
   A high-ranking member of the dominant United<br />
   Russia party says the attack on the mayor is a<br />
   serious one, but he will manage to remain through<br />
   his term in 2011 because there is no alternative<br />
   to him. Besides, the Kremlin and the government<br />
   have not reached a verdict on his resignation.<br />
<br />
   Also, the purpose of the present campaign is to<br />
   prepare public opinion about his leaving the<br />
   scene and to show the mayor that his power is not forever.<br />

   Modernization From Below<br />
   By Vladimir Ryzhkov<br />
   Vladimir Ryzhkov, a State Duma deputy from 1993<br />
   to 2007, hosts a political talk show on Ekho Moskvy radio.<br />
<br />
   In his September a**Go, Russia!a** article, President<br />
   Dmitry Medvedev lashed out angrily at those who<br />
   oppose his impassioned call for modernization. He<br />
   wrote, a**Influential groups of corrupt officials<br />
   and do-nothing a**entrepreneursa** are well<br />
   ensconced. They have everything and are<br />
   satisfied. Theya**re going to squeeze the profits<br />
   from the remnants of Soviet industry and squander<br />
   the natural resources that belong to all of us<br />
   until the end of the century. They are not<br />
   creating anything new, do not want development and fear it.a**<br />
<br />
   A survey conducted by the Levada Center from<br />
   Sept. 18 to 21 offers insights into the thinking<br />
   of Russiaa**s business and political elite. It<br />
   confirms that Medvedev hit the nail on the head:<br />
   The countrya**s elite are generally satisfied with<br />
   the status quo and do not want to change anything.<br />
<br />
   As it turns out, there is a major discrepancy<br />
   between the way the poor majority and the thin<br />
   layer of the wealthy ruling elite view Medvedeva**s<br />
   call for modernization. Fewer than half of all<br />
   poor people think that the country is on the<br />
   right track, while two-thirds of the wealthy<br />
   think that it is. As always, the crisis hit the<br />
   poorest families the hardest, 60 percent to 75<br />
   percent of whom have been directly affected by<br />
   it, compared with only 24 percent of the richest<br />
   families and about 40 percent of those living<br />
   somewhere above the minimum. Surprisingly, 24<br />
   percent of the wealthiest families became even<br />
   wealthier during this period, and 61 percent of<br />
   the richest families experienced no change at all.<br />
<br />
   The top 0.5 percent of the wealthiest people in<br />
   the country are optimistic about the future, with<br />
   80 percent believing that a**everything will work<br />
   outa** in the near future. Only 22 percent of the<br />
   poorest people share that opinion. That same 0.5<br />
   percent of the countrya**s nouveau riche is Prime<br />
   Minister Vladimir Putina**s strongest support base,<br />
   73 percent of whom rate him favorably. Only 43<br />
   percent of the poor like Putin. Not surprisingly,<br />
   United Russia, which Putin heads, is also popular<br />
   among wealthy Russians, with their support for<br />
   the party ranging from 46 percent to 74 percent.<br />
   Only 30 percent to 40 percent of the poorest<br />
   Russians support the party of power. This may<br />
   explain the widespread allegations that election<br />
   returns were falsified in United Russiaa**s favor in the Oct. 11 vote.<br />
<br />
   The survey also revealed an interesting attitude<br />
   toward corruption, which Medvedev has repeatedly<br />
   called the countrya**s main scourge. The poor<br />
   majority constitute about 90 percent of the<br />
   population, and about the same percentage of<br />
   respondents said they a**definitely agreea** or<br />
   a**probably agreea** with the presidenta**s alarmist<br />
   conclusions,  while only 55 percent of the<br />
   wealthiest people share the presidenta**s opinion,<br />
   with 44 percent saying they a**probably disagreea**<br />
   with him. It is obvious that the Russian elite<br />
   are quite satisfied with the corrupt system that has developed in this<br />
   country.<br />
<br />
   There were differing views regarding the ability<br />
   of Russians to change the fundamental problems in<br />
   the countrya**s political and economic systems.<br />
    From 41 percent to 53 percent of the poor and<br />
   very poor agree with Medvedev that a**the Russian<br />
   people can overcome the resistance of corrupt<br />
   officials and businessmen who are bargaining away<br />
   the countrya**s wealth,a** but not a single<br />
   respondent among the very wealthiest fully agreed<br />
   with that statement, and only 37 percent partially agreed.<br />
<br />
   At the same time, the wealthiest Russians are<br />
   more pro-Western than the poor majority, largely<br />
   agreeing with Medvedeva**s claim that Russia should<br />
   strengthen ties with the West. While only 30<br />
   percent to 50 percent of the poor support the<br />
   president on this issue, 60 percent to 80 percent<br />
   of the wealthy and very wealthy do. That can be<br />
   explained by the fact that the elite hold most of<br />
   their money in Western bank accounts, their<br />
   children study in Western universities and they<br />
   vacation in their Western villas and luxury apartments.<br />
<br />
   Russiaa**s ultrarich are forming a ruling caste<br />
   that controls most of the countrya**s wealth, and<br />
   they are growing increasingly isolated from the<br />
   rest of society. About 70 percent of respondents<br />
   with moderate incomes answered that they have at<br />
   least one relative or acquaintance who recently<br />
   lost his job, while 40 percent to 76 percent of<br />
   the wealthy do not have any friends or<br />
   acquaintances who experienced that hardship.<br />
<br />
   If Medvedev wants to modernize the country, the<br />
   first thing he should do is change the people<br />
   with whom he consults on a regular basis. At<br />
   present, most of them come from the wealthiest 10<br />
   percent of the population A those who are<br />
   satisfied with the status quo and who are<br />
   protected from the harmful effects of the<br />
   economic crisis, as well as from political and<br />
   economic competition. The presidenta**s recent<br />
   meeting with the countrya**s top business leaders<br />
   is a perfect example. It is no surprise that they<br />
   advised him to raise protectionist barriers and<br />
   encouraged him not to be ashamed about the highly<br />
   suspicious landslide victory of United Russia candidates in the Oct. 11<br />
   vote.<br />
<br />
   If Medvedev really wants to modernize Russia, he<br />
   should be listening more closely to the majority<br />
   of the Russian people and not to the oligarchs and their servants.<br />

   Regional Dimensions: Fresh Faces in a Stale System<br />
   By Nikolai Petrov<br />
   Nikolai Petrov is a scholar in residence at the Carnegie Moscow Center.<br />
<br />
   United Russia has presented its list to President<br />
   Dmitry Medvedev of gubernatorial candidates for<br />
   the Altai, Komi and Marii-El republics, as well<br />
   as the Primorye, Astrakhan, Kurgan, Volgograd and Sverdlovsk regions.<br />
<br />
   The new system introduced by Medvedev last year<br />
   whereby the party holding the majority in the<br />
   regional parliaments A that is, United Russia A<br />
   names the candidate for the gubernatorial post<br />
   has not been fully implemented in a single<br />
   region, but a modified plan has already been<br />
   activated. According to amendments introduced by<br />
   the president and passed by the State Duma on a<br />
   first reading, the majority party must present<br />
   its list of candidates within 40 days, down from<br />
   the previous limit of 90 days. Similarly, the<br />
   president must review the list and make his<br />
   choices within 10 days of receiving it, down from the previous 30 days.<br />
<br />
   The extended review period created confusion as a<br />
   number of prominent regional politicians jockeyed<br />
   for the top spot. This time, however, to avoid<br />
   paralyzing regional governments while the Kremlin<br />
   conducts its review, the names of all eight<br />
   incumbent governors were included in the list of<br />
   candidates. Some of them, like Sverdlovsk<br />
   Governor Eduard Rossel, undertook an<br />
   unprecedented campaign of public activity to<br />
   demonstrate to the Kremlin their indispensability.<br />
<br />
   In the Volgograd region, deputies of the<br />
   legislative assembly have begun preparing for the<br />
   possibility of an outsider being appointed by<br />
   initiating government reforms that would<br />
   significantly strengthen parliamentary authority<br />
   at the expense of gubernatorial powers.<br />
<br />
   What criteria will the Kremlin use to make its<br />
   final choices? Political considerations alone are<br />
   unlikely to dissuade the president from replacing<br />
   governors. Judging from the results of the Oct.<br />
   11 elections, the Kremlin believes that the<br />
   economic crisis has either passed or that the<br />
   worst is already over. That puts many incumbent<br />
   governors at risk of losing their jobs A<br />
   especially the likes of Rossel, Volgograd<br />
   Governor Nikolai Maksyuta and Astrakhan Governor<br />
   Alexander Zhilkin. A number of other regional<br />
   leaders, including Kurgan Governor Oleg<br />
   Bogomolov, Altai Governor Alexander Berdnikov and<br />
   Komi Governor Vladimir Torlopov, are also walking on thin ice.<br />
<br />
   No less important than the question of which<br />
   governors are on their way out is who will be<br />
   sent in to replace them. Lists of candidates<br />
   include incumbent governors, two or three<br />
   alternative candidates chosen from the ranks of<br />
   regional politicians A typically the deputy<br />
   governor or the speaker A or a Moscow official of deputy minister rank.<br />
<br />
   Most likely, however, the new governors will be<br />
   appointed from outside the regions in which they<br />
   are expected to serve. Today, the fate of 10<br />
   percent of the governors hangs in the balance.<br />
   Medvedev has remained silent so far. But the<br />
   deadlines are approaching, and by next week we<br />
   should already hear his decision for at least the<br />
   Sverdlovsk gubernatorial spot. It is even<br />
   possible, though unlikely, that after mature<br />
   reflection the president will reject the entire<br />
   list of candidates and demand a new one A or put<br />
   forward candidates of his own.<br />
<br />
   In any case, it appears that we are in store for<br />
   some changes. The only problem is that while we<br />
   will surely see a fresh slate of governors, the<br />
   system for how they are appointed will remain the same.<br />

   Putin Calls For Restructuring Regional, Municipal Govt Network<br />
<br />
   MOSCOW, October 26 (Itar-Tass) -- Prime Minister<br />
   Vladimir Putin called for restructuring a network<br />
   of regional and local authorities and stopping their enlargement.<br />
<br />
   He said the growing number of regional and<br />
   municipal officials and a result the growth of<br />
   administrative expenses remained one of the serious problems in Russia.<br />
<br />
   &quot;We could see this tendency even in the first<br />
   half of 2009, when the crisis was at its peak.<br />
   That's totally wrong,&quot; Putin said at a meeting of<br />
   the government commission on regional development.<br />
<br />
   He said administrative expenses at the federal<br />
   and municipal levels had increased by 30 percent<br />
   in 2008. The growth in 2009 was not as big - 4<br />
   percent -- because of the crisis. &quot;But still<br />
   there was a growth, and this at a time of crisis,<br />
   when we try to economise wherever possible. I<br />
   flatly reject references to new tasks. This<br />
   network should be restructured,&quot; Putin said.<br />
<br />
   He also said that ineffective administrative<br />
   expenditures were unacceptably big and had<br />
   exceeded 116 billion roubles in 2008.<br />
<br />
   Putin urged regions to live according to their<br />
   means and stop inflating budget expenditures.<br />
<br />
   Consolidated regional and municipal budget<br />
   expenditures in 2009 increased by 4 percent and<br />
   in some regions by more than 25 percent, Putin<br />
   said at a meeting of the commission on regional development.<br />
<br />
   He noted that many regions are increasing public<br />
   administration and other such expenditures. &quot;On<br />
   the whole, consolidated regional and municipal<br />
   budget expenditures for administrative bodies in<br />
   2009 increased by 4 percent, and in some regions<br />
   by more than 25 percent,&quot; the prime minister<br />
   said, adding that the growth was 38 percent in<br />
   the Magadan region, 30 percent in Ingushetia, 25<br />
   percent in the Nizhny Novgorod region, 27 percent<br />
   in Moscow, and 24 percent in Adygeya.<br />
<br />
   &quot;The following arguments are put forth: the<br />
   overall workload for the administrative personnel<br />
   is increasing and money is needed for the work of<br />
   anti-crisis groups, monitoring and other<br />
   additional functions. New funding is secured for such tasks,&quot; Putin said.<br />
<br />
   &quot;Anti-crisis management should be ensured by way<br />
   of internal redistribution of resources and<br />
   personnel, saving in less important areas rather<br />
   than by inflating staffs and budgets,&quot; he added.<br />
<br />
   Only officials in Ingushetia could account for<br />
   such growth. Until recently legislation allowed<br />
   civil servants in Ingushetia to be underpaid for<br />
   special conditions of work, Ingush government<br />
   chief of staff Ayub Gagiyev said. Under federal<br />
   legislation, the extra pay may be as big as up to<br />
   200 percent of the base salary, but did not<br />
   exceed 50 percent in the republic. &quot;We have<br />
   brought the extra pay in line with federal<br />
   legislation. As a result, civil servant<br />
   expenditures have increased since May of this<br />
   year,&quot; he explained to the business daily Vedomosti.<br />
<br />
   &quot;The second factor behind the growth of<br />
   administrative expenditures is that the minimum<br />
   wage is 4,330 roubles since January 1. But before<br />
   that many categories of civil servants received<br />
   less, and we have to obligate all governmental<br />
   institutions to pay salaries that at least match<br />
   that amount. The number of government officials<br />
   in the republic has decreased from last year by 5<br />
   percent to about 1,000 people.&quot;<br />
<br />
   Putin urged regions to live according to their means.<br />
<br />
   Kudrin said earlier that the optimisation of<br />
   administrative expenditures in Russian regions was inevitable.<br />
<br />
   &quot;Today's signal sent to regions by the chairman<br />
   of the government will be taken into account,&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
   The minister said the regions that fail to<br />
   optimise administrative expenditures would get small aid.<br />
<br />
   According to the minister, travel, repair,<br />
   purchase and automobile expenses would be cut by 15 percent in 2010.<br />
<br />
   &quot;When drafting the budget for 2010 we sharply<br />
   reduced ministerial and departmental expenditures,&quot; Kudrin said.<br />
<br />
   Administrative expenditures were cut by 30<br />
   percent in 2009 and will be cut by another 15<br />
   percent in 2010. &quot;The overall reduction will<br />
   exceed 40 percent,&quot; the minister said.<br />
<br />
   According to an FBK survey, combined<br />
   administrative expenses in the first six months<br />
   of the year increased by 3.8 percent in regions<br />
   and by 16.4 percent at the federal level.<br />
<br />
   Due to the crisis, budget revenues are<br />
   plummeting, but expenditures, primarily administrative ones, are growing.<br />
<br />
   Combined administrative expenses in regional<br />
   budgets in the first six months of 2009 exceeded<br />
   last year's indicator by 3.8 percent. But federal<br />
   administrative expenses grew much faster at a<br />
   rate of 16.4 percent in the same period.<br />
<br />
   The director of FBK's Department of Strategic<br />
   Analysis, Igor Nikolayev, believes that the<br />
   federal government's complaints that regional<br />
   authorities are inflating administrative expenses<br />
   seem to be unjustified. It's the other way round:<br />
   the federal government appears to be much less modest.<br />

   The Dissident Who Came In From the Cold<br />
   Nikita Belykh is radically remaking Russia's vast<br />
   Kirov region. The country's democratic future may depend on his success.<br />
   By Owen Matthews and Anna Nemtsova<br />
<br />
   Dozens of villagers are lined up at the gates of<br />
   the decrepit local boatyard on a breezy Saturday<br />
   morning to witness an unheard-of event. They gaze<br />
   in wonder as the visitor arrives: never in living<br />
   memory has a regional governor paid a call to the<br />
   backwater town of Arkul, on the Vyatka River,<br />
   roughly 500 miles northeast of Moscow. Climbing<br />
   out of his battered Land Cruiser in scuffed jeans<br />
   and a New York Yankees cap, Nikita Belykh makes a<br />
   startling contrast to Russia's standard-issue provincial bureaucrats.<br />
<br />
   Looks are the least of the differences: Belykh<br />
   made his name opposing those entrenched<br />
   post-Soviet apparatchiks as one of the most<br />
   determined pro-democracy activists in the<br />
   country. Old friends were shocked and angry when<br />
   he abruptly abandoned their street protests and<br />
   took a Kremlin appointment as governor of Kirov<br />
   oblast, deep in Russia's neglected heartland. But<br />
   Belykh is tackling his new job with all the<br />
   energy he used to radiate as an opposition<br />
   leader. He immediately begins peppering the<br />
   boatyard's director with questionsAespecially<br />
   about what needs fixing. &quot;Tell me what you do!&quot;<br />
   Belykh says briskly. &quot;Tell me everything!&quot;<br />
<br />
   The shipyard is one small piece of an experiment<br />
   he hopes will transform RussiaAand so far, at<br />
   least, he has the blessing of no less than<br />
   Russia's president, Dmitry Medvedev. It was<br />
   Medvedev who appointed Belykh to the job late<br />
   last year, essentially granting him a<br />
   socioeconomic laboratory slightly larger than<br />
   England. Kirov is a microcosm of Russia and its<br />
   problemsAchronic unemployment, decaying Soviet<br />
   infrastructure and wretched public-health<br />
   conditions, to name only three. Medvedev has made<br />
   it clear that Kirov is his personal project and<br />
   Belykh his protA(c)gA(c). If Belykh can raise Kirov up<br />
   from its knees, there will be a clear precedent<br />
   for applying the same management style across<br />
   Russia. &quot;Maybe some people would like to see us<br />
   liberals fail,&quot; says Belykh. &quot;My job is to prove the opposite.&quot;<br />
<br />
   And fast. Medvedev publicly deplores Russia's<br />
   economic plight and has called for massive<br />
   changes, but he may not have much longer to do<br />
   anything about it. Former president Vladimir<br />
   Putin, the KGB veteran who chose him as<br />
   successor, recently dropped broad hints that he<br />
   intends to take the presidency back at the next<br />
   election, in 2012. Worse yet for both Medvedev<br />
   and Belykh, hostility toward the Kirov project is<br />
   growing, even within Medvedev's (and Putin's) own<br />
   United Russia party. Two weeks ago the party's<br />
   youth wing, the Young Guards, marched against<br />
   Belykh's plan to hold a conference on regional<br />
   development in Kirov. Whipped up by false rumors<br />
   that the conference was sponsored by the U.S.<br />
   International Republican Institute, the<br />
   protesters carried professionally made banners<br />
   with slogans like GET OUT WASHINGTON ORGANIZERS!<br />
   and YANKEE GO HOME! They displayed no qualms<br />
   about publicly attacking Medvedev's protA(c)gA(c)Aa sign of bigger<br />
   challenges ahead.<br />
<br />
   But Belykh seems undeterred. Even by the<br />
   standards of Russian democratic activists, he has<br />
   a mind of his own. He grew up in a well-educated<br />
   family near the Urals city of Perm. His parents<br />
   expected him to study at one of the top schools<br />
   in Moscow, but when he was 16 his father died of<br />
   a heart attack, and Belykh stayed in Perm to look<br />
   after his mother. That was the year Boris Yeltsin<br />
   stood atop a tank and defied an attempted coup by<br />
   hardliners trying to roll back democratic<br />
   reforms. To this day, Russia's first post-Soviet<br />
   president remains Belykh's hero. &quot;I come from a<br />
   generation of Yeltsin democrats,&quot; he says.<br />
   &quot;Nobody else but Yeltsin dared to give people<br />
   freedom in the conditions Russia lived in the<br />
   1990s. Unfortunately we did not manage to keep<br />
   that hard-won freedom.&quot; Belykh adds, &quot;Now our job<br />
   is to rehabilitate democracy.&quot;<br />
<br />
   A high flier from the start, Belykh majored in<br />
   law and economics simultaneously at Perm State.<br />
   At 23 he was made vice president of a local<br />
   investment house, and at 28 he was appointed the<br />
   region's vice governor. The next yearA2003Ahe ran<br />
   for Parliament on the reformist Union of Right<br />
   Forces ticket, but the tide had turned against<br />
   the progressives: the party won no seats at all.<br />
   Belykh stuck with the party anyway and moved to<br />
   Moscow to become its leader, but times grew even<br />
   tougher, and members began talking about making<br />
   peace with Putin. Belykh opposed any such idea.<br />
   &quot;I did not see myself as a part of the Kremlin's<br />
   project,&quot; he recalls. He quit the party in protest.<br />
<br />
   Putin's strong-arm tactics had effectively<br />
   neutered Russia's liberal opposition. And yet<br />
   Belykh couldn't just stand by while the country<br />
   deteriorated. While Putin has won heavy domestic<br />
   support with his loud, aggressive foreign policy,<br />
   Russia is hollowing out inside. Reform at the<br />
   local level gets no attention, but it's essential<br />
   if the country is ever to thrive.<br />
<br />
   That's where Belykh decided to focus his efforts.<br />
   He passed a message to Medvedev that he wanted to<br />
   work in regional government. He knew his old<br />
   associates would accuse him of selling out, but<br />
   he saw no other way he could make a difference.<br />
   He was still struggling with himself when<br />
   Medvedev suggested making him governor of Kirov.<br />
   The Kremlin wasn't taking chances. Belykh's first<br />
   interview was with Vladislav Surkov, the<br />
   Kremlin's chief ideologist, who warned him to<br />
   keep his mouth shut in public about national<br />
   issues like the war with Georgia. Belykh would be<br />
   permitted to do a weekly radio show called A<br />
   Governor's Diary on the liberal Moscow-based<br />
   Radio Echo networkAbut only if the program stayed<br />
   away from &quot;provocative&quot; questions.<br />
<br />
   The new governor arrived in Kirov in January. One<br />
   of the first things he did was hang a portrait of<br />
   Boris Yeltsin on his office wall. Then he<br />
   auctioned off his predecessor's official car, a<br />
   Lexus. He allowed all street protests to go<br />
   ahead, including a thinly attended gay pride<br />
   parade, and announced he was ready to meet with<br />
   any group that had a beef with the government.<br />
   He's been working 12-hour days ever since, mainly<br />
   talking with people about their grievances.<br />
<br />
   Kirov has no shortage of complaints. Unemployment<br />
   is set to reach 20 percent by the end of the<br />
   year. The oblast's sole gasoline distributor,<br />
   Lukoil, uses its monopoly to demand the highest<br />
   prices in the entire Volga federal region.<br />
   Infrastructure and public utilities are a<br />
   constant source of outrage. And as almost<br />
   everywhere in Russia, the demographics are a<br />
   disaster: between January and August 2008 (the<br />
   most recent statistics available) Kirov recorded<br />
   10,474 births and 16,204 deaths in a total<br />
   population of 1.5 million. On top of that, an<br />
   estimated 15,000 people left last year to seek better lives elsewhere.<br />
<br />
   But what seems even more baffling to Belykh is<br />
   that Kirov's people seem stuck in the old ways of<br />
   dealing with a hostile bureaucracy. &quot;For the<br />
   first time in my life I find myself on the same<br />
   side of the barricades as the government,&quot; he<br />
   says in frustration. At one recent meeting, he<br />
   struck a deal with local labor chiefs on job<br />
   security and keeping factories openAand the next<br />
   day, they published an open letter excoriating<br />
   him for trying to cut teachers' salaries. In<br />
   another instance, a group of local NGOs organized<br />
   street protests against high utility rates only a<br />
   day after Belykh gathered their leaders in his<br />
   office to find a solution to exactly that<br />
   problem. &quot;I want to say to them: 'People, I am<br />
   much more experienced with protests than all of<br />
   you. Here I am, your governor, come in and find solutions together with<br />
   me!' &quot;<br />
<br />
   But the single biggest challenge may be the<br />
   region's law-enforcement system. Local NGOs have<br />
   documented dozens of police-brutality charges,<br />
   including numerous alleged cases of anal rape in<br />
   police custody. At least four alleged victims<br />
   have registered complaints with prosecutors.<br />
   Nevertheless, victims who were interviewed by<br />
   NEWSWEEK insisted on closing their curtains and<br />
   speaking in whispers for fear of retribution. Few<br />
   have much hope that Belykh will prevail over the<br />
   local security forces. &quot;There are areas which<br />
   neither Belykh nor even President Medvedev can<br />
   change,&quot; says one of the victims' lawyers, asking<br />
   not to be named criticizing the police. &quot;I have<br />
   lived a long life in the Russian law-enforcement<br />
   system and can assure you, it lives by its own rules.&quot;<br />
<br />
   Belykh has asked all his old activist friends to<br />
   join his team in Kirov, but few are willing to<br />
   relocate so far from the social and cultural<br />
   mainstream. Even his wife and their three<br />
   children remain in Moscow, where she manages a<br />
   travel agency. (Their eldest son, 6-year-old<br />
   Yuri, started school there in September because<br />
   Belykh didn't want the boy tagged by Kirov<br />
   classmates as &quot;the governor's son.&quot;) One activist<br />
   friend who has accepted the invitation is Maria<br />
   Gaidar, 27, the daughter of Yeltsin's acting<br />
   prime minister back in 1992, YegorGaidar. She<br />
   once rappelled down the side of the Great Stone<br />
   Bridge just outside the Kremlin, to unfurl a<br />
   banner declaring NO TO KGB POWER. When Belykh<br />
   accepted the Kirov job, she excoriated him for<br />
   &quot;selling his soul to the devil&quot; but then<br />
   relented. Another old friend from the opposition,<br />
   Konstantin Arzamastsev, had to think hard before<br />
   joining the team. &quot;Only my respect for Belykh<br />
   made me take this job,&quot; he says. &quot;Kirov is far<br />
   from being an easy place to liberalize.&quot;<br />
<br />
   After months of wrangling, Belykh has managed to<br />
   appoint eight deputies, but almost every other<br />
   member of his government is a holdover from the<br />
   old regime. Kirov's legislature has blocked other<br />
   appointments. By law the governor is also<br />
   entitled to nominate a senator to represent Kirov<br />
   in the Federation Council, but Belykh's pick was<br />
   vetoed by Medvedev himself. &quot;They made Belykh<br />
   governor without letting him put together a team<br />
   of his own,&quot; says an aide to Nikolai Shaklein,<br />
   the senator who was named instead, requesting<br />
   anonymity when discussing his bosses.<br />
<br />
   Nevertheless, Belykh insists on running the place<br />
   his wayAas democratically as possible. He keeps<br />
   his advisers working practically nonstop and has<br />
   them debate all sides of any issue before he<br />
   makes a decision on it. &quot;We plan to turn this<br />
   region into the most transparent,<br />
   corruption-free, and business-friendly region in<br />
   Russia,&quot; says Gaidar. &quot;But that is a long way<br />
   off. We face a wall of Soviet mentality that has<br />
   not changed in 20 years.&quot; Sometimes it seems<br />
   nearly impossible. &quot;On my worst days I think it<br />
   is easier to rule like an Asian despot than to<br />
   become a Russian Obama,&quot; Belykh says. &quot;But look,<br />
   to me this job is a chance to change people's<br />
   attitudes about democratic values.&quot;<br />
<br />
   Changing those attitudes in Kirov alone will take<br />
   &quot;a social revolution,&quot; Belykh says. First, people<br />
   need to see tangible benefits in their lives.<br />
   &quot;The level of trust for liberals in Putin's<br />
   Russia has shrunk to almost zero,&quot; says Belykh.<br />
   Even so, Medvedev has shown plenty of trust in<br />
   him. This May the president became the first<br />
   Russian leader to visit the oblast since Tsar<br />
   Alexander I in 1824. Medvedev didn't merely put<br />
   in an appearance; with Belykh at his side, he<br />
   announced a crowd-pleasing new plan to pay newly<br />
   unemployed Russians a full year's benefits to<br />
   help them launch new businesses. &quot;I am Medvedev's<br />
   man,&quot; says Belykh. &quot;I am his appointee, on his<br />
   team. And not anybody else's.&quot; The question is<br />
   how far the leader of that team can go to make Belykh's experiment a<br />
   success.<br />

   The Kremlin Wars (Special Series), Part 3: Rise of the Civiliki<br />
<br />
   Summary<br />
<br />
   The global economic crisis has led the Kremlin to<br />
   examine its decisions about running Russia's<br />
   economy, financial sectors and businesses. A<br />
   group of intellectuals including Russian<br />
   President Dmitri Medvedev, called the civiliki,<br />
   want to use the crisis as an opportunity to<br />
   reform the Russian economy. The civiliki's plan<br />
   will lead to increased investment and greater<br />
   efficiency in the economy, but it will also<br />
   trigger a fresh round of conflict between the<br />
   Kremlin's two powerful political clans.<br />
<br />
   Editor's Note: This is part three in a five-part<br />
   series examining the Russian political clans and<br />
   the coming conflict between them.<br />
<br />
   Analysis<br />
<br />
   In the aftermath of the global economic crisis,<br />
   Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has had to<br />
   step back and examine the Kremlin's decisions on<br />
   running the country's economy, financial sectors<br />
   and businesses and the effects of a<br />
   state-controlled system on investment, growth and<br />
   the freedom of capital. In response, a group of<br />
   Russian intellectuals called the civiliki, who<br />
   are trained in economics, law and finance, have<br />
   presented proposals on &quot;fixing&quot; the economy. The<br />
   civiliki (a play on words, since the Federal<br />
   Security Service and other members of the<br />
   security class in Russia are called the siloviki)<br />
   is a new group of economically liberal-minded (by<br />
   Russian standards) politicians and businessmen.<br />
   This group includes Russian President Dmitri<br />
   Medvedev, Finance Minister Alexei Kudrin (who is<br />
   also a deputy prime minister), Sberbank chief German Gref and many more.<br />
<br />
   The civiliki are not ideologues like the liberal<br />
   Russian reformers of the 1990s and understand<br />
   that the Russian economy and institutions must<br />
   maintain some sense of balance with national<br />
   security and national interests. But the civiliki<br />
   also see how much damage the siloviki's control<br />
   of key power structures and businesses has done to the Russian economy.<br />
<br />
   The civiliki's plan has one main goal in mind: to<br />
   implement real structural reform in Russia's<br />
   major economic sectors. This will improve<br />
   competition, attract investment and purge waste<br />
   and mismanagement. The plan has three parts --<br />
   purge the non-business-minded siloviki from<br />
   positions of economic responsibility, introduce<br />
   new pro-investment laws and partially liberalize<br />
   the economy. It is an incredibly ambitious plan<br />
   that would reverse laws designed by the FSB and<br />
   Putin over the past six years. But the reforms<br />
   are being spearheaded by the one man Putin trusts<br />
   on all finance and economic issues: the civiliki's Kudrin.<br />
<br />
   Kudrin is an experienced official, being one of<br />
   the very few to make the transition from the<br />
   Yeltsin era to Putin's Russia and having held a<br />
   prominent position in every one of Putin's<br />
   governments. The reason for his longevity at the<br />
   Kremlin is simple: Rather than playing politics<br />
   (to the extent usually seen in Russia) he is a<br />
   technocrat who makes decisions based largely on<br />
   the economic facts. His numbers-oriented mind,<br />
   apolitical nature and competency as a manager are<br />
   at least as important to Russia's relative<br />
   financial stability as the strong energy prices<br />
   of the past decade. Because of this, Putin values<br />
   Kudrin's counsel greatly. Kudrin has also been an<br />
   important buffer between Deputy Chief of Staff<br />
   and First Aide to Vladimir Putin Vladislav Surkov<br />
   and Deputy Prime Minister Igor Sechin, the heads<br />
   of the Kremlin's opposing clans -- until now.<br />
<br />
   Kudrin's Plan<br />
<br />
   Part 1: Purging the Siloviki<br />
<br />
   The most controversial part of Kudrin's plan is<br />
   to purge the siloviki from positions of control<br />
   over businesses and economic institutions. The<br />
   siloviki clan, run by Sechin, took command of<br />
   most of the Russian state firms over the past six<br />
   years, and has -- by Kudrin's technocratic<br />
   reckoning -- run them poorly. The siloviki run<br />
   firms including oil giant Rosneft, rail monopoly<br />
   Russian Railways, Russian airline Aeroflot,<br />
   nuclear energy company Rosatom and arms exporter<br />
   Rosoboronexport. The issue is that the siloviki<br />
   have placed former KGB agents as heads of<br />
   industry and businesses though many have no<br />
   expertise as businessmen. According to Kudrin, it<br />
   was largely Sechin's clan that sought access to<br />
   international credit before the global economic<br />
   crisis hit. Some $500 billion flowed into Russia<br />
   via such connections, flooding the Russian<br />
   financial sector with foreign capital. Sechin's<br />
   clan spent the money as if it were free, often on<br />
   irrational mergers and acquisitions that<br />
   increased the clan's political power but had little economic purpose.<br />
<br />
   When the global recession occurred, all those<br />
   funding sources dried up in a matter of weeks.<br />
   And as the ruble declined, all of those loans<br />
   still required repayment -- in the<br />
   then-appreciated U.S. dollars, euros and Swiss<br />
   francs. Consequently, the Russian economy<br />
   suffered a contraction worse than any other major<br />
   state in the world. The Kremlin was forced to<br />
   bail out many firms, particularly those linked to<br />
   Sechin's clan, to prevent a broader collapse. As<br />
   part of the efforts to contain the crisis, the<br />
   Kremlin also spent more than $200 billion on<br />
   slowing the depreciation of the ruble so that the<br />
   loans taken out by corporations and banks did not<br />
   appreciate so much that they would not be<br />
   repayable. From Kudrin's perspective, this was a<br />
   huge cost to save companies whose managers had no business being in<br />
   business.<br />
<br />
   Kudrin's plan is to weed out the security-minded<br />
   officials now occupying leadership positions in<br />
   industry and business, leaving only those who can<br />
   actually run their institutions properly. But in<br />
   doing this, Kudrin would strip Sechin's clan of<br />
   massive economic and financial clout --something<br />
   the siloviki would not stand for.<br />
<br />
   Part 2: Making Russia Investor-Friendly<br />
<br />
   Next, Kudrin's plan calls for legal changes that<br />
   would make Russia more attractive to investors.<br />
   One of the issues investors have with Russia is<br />
   that there is very little legal protection, which<br />
   leaves them highly vulnerable to hostile<br />
   takeovers and becoming a target for the Kremlin<br />
   or its power players. Moreover, the few legal<br />
   authorities that do exist -- like the Federal Tax<br />
   Service or the Audit Chamber -- often are tools<br />
   for the Kremlin to help it pressure Russian and<br />
   foreign firms that the government wants to either<br />
   destroy or devour. The best-known case of this is<br />
   the story of Yukos, whose owner Mikhail<br />
   Khodorkovsky had evolved from businessman to<br />
   ruler of Russia's vast oil sector and aspiring<br />
   politician -- much to the Kremlin's ire. In 2004,<br />
   the government brought the full power of a<br />
   reinvigorated state to bear against Khodorkovsky<br />
   and sent him to a Siberian prison. Other examples<br />
   are of the Kremlin targeting energy assets<br />
   belonging to foreign firms like BP and Royal<br />
   Dutch/Shell to give those assets and/or control<br />
   over projects to state-controlled energy firms.<br />
<br />
   In theory, the new investors' rights laws would<br />
   protect businessmen and investors in Russia. The<br />
   country has never had sound laws protecting<br />
   investors' rights. However, it is most likely<br />
   that any new laws will leave the state plenty of<br />
   wiggle room to ensure that the Kremlin has<br />
   significant control over investors' actions.<br />
<br />
   The next step to creating an investor-friendly<br />
   Russia, according to Kudrin's plan, is to repeal<br />
   the strict energy cap laws Putin put in place in<br />
   2007. These laws affect strategic industries and<br />
   clarify which assets would be off-limits to<br />
   foreigners. The sector affected most by these<br />
   laws was energy. The laws limit foreign firms'<br />
   ability to own more than 40 percent of a project<br />
   in the country and forbid foreign firms from<br />
   owning any projects involving the subsoil. These<br />
   laws have made Russia an unattractive environment<br />
   for foreign businesses to maintain or expand<br />
   investments in energy projects, even though<br />
   Russia is one of the world's most energy-rich countries.<br />
<br />
   But Kudrin's plan involves more than repealing<br />
   the energy laws and allowing foreign firms to<br />
   rush back in. There is a political side to the<br />
   plan, masterminded by Surkov. The changes in<br />
   Russian energy laws will allow foreign companies<br />
   to own up to a 50 percent stake in projects, but<br />
   if a foreign firm wants majority control then it<br />
   must &quot;trade&quot; assets outside of Russia with one of<br />
   the Russian energy behemoths. In essence, Russia<br />
   will allow foreign companies to own majority<br />
   stakes in large projects like the new fields on<br />
   the Yamal peninsula in exchange for downstream<br />
   projects in those companies' own countries. The<br />
   goal is for Russian energy companies to not only<br />
   move more into the downstream sector, but also<br />
   have greater access to international markets --<br />
   something the Kremlin can use later for political<br />
   purposes. STRATFOR sources say deals like this<br />
   are already being negotiated with firms like BP,<br />
   France's Total and EDF Trading, and U.S.-based ExxonMobil.<br />
<br />
   Part 3: Reprivatization<br />
<br />
   The last part of Kudrin's plan is to reprivatize<br />
   the vast number of companies the Kremlin has<br />
   taken over in the last few years. Under Putin,<br />
   the Russian state once again became the main<br />
   driver of economic activity. Upon becoming leader<br />
   of Russia in 1999, Putin set a goal to reverse<br />
   the massive privatization that occurred during<br />
   the 1990s -- like the housing and voucher<br />
   privatizations and loans-for-shares schemes --<br />
   that, in most Russians' eyes, wrecked the<br />
   country. Putin wanted to put the Kremlin back in<br />
   control by consolidating its power over a slew of<br />
   economic sectors, including energy, banking and<br />
   defense. As of this year, the Russian state and<br />
   regional authorities own approximately 50 percent<br />
   of Russian businesses, according to Kudrin.<br />
<br />
   In the short term, Russian state control over<br />
   strategic sectors made sense. It pushed out<br />
   forces that were not too friendly with the<br />
   Kremlin, like the oligarchs and foreign groups.<br />
   But it also allowed the state to marshal its<br />
   financial resources toward certain key domestic<br />
   and foreign policy goals. Russian economic<br />
   consolidation under the state brought about a<br />
   stability that most Russians had longed for after the 1990s.<br />
<br />
   However, in the long term, the lack of non-state<br />
   funding and private capital has become a problem,<br />
   creating inefficiencies across the board --<br />
   particularly in areas where the state does not<br />
   focus a great deal of its resources. Russia is<br />
   traditionally capital-poor; therefore, any major<br />
   economic overhaul needs to include the creation<br />
   of an investment-friendly climate. The financial<br />
   crisis made this clear; when the state took on<br />
   the burdens of the failing private sector, it<br />
   swallowed more businesses and industries but also<br />
   took on their debt and need for cash.<br />
<br />
   Kudrin's plan is for the state to step back and<br />
   start reprivatizing some 5,500 firms over the<br />
   next three years -- which would drop state<br />
   ownership in Russian firms by approximately 20<br />
   percent. The goal is to abandon some of the<br />
   companies currently draining the government's<br />
   coffers, but this step will also generate cash<br />
   through the sales needed for the government to<br />
   plug 2010's estimated budget deficit. Kudrin also<br />
   believes that once the government starts to<br />
   reduce its stake in companies, a more competitive<br />
   environment will form in the Russian economy,<br />
   allowing it to become more diversified.<br />
<br />
   Kudrin wants to ensure that the next<br />
   reprivatization looks nothing like the feeding<br />
   frenzy of the 1990s. In the minds of the<br />
   civiliki, the failures of the 1990s were caused<br />
   not only by investor greed but also by the<br />
   state's failure to create a rational environment<br />
   for privatization. The Russian state in 2009 is<br />
   much stronger than it was in the 1990s, so Kudrin<br />
   believes that the new round of privatization<br />
   would be controllable, and the fact that the<br />
   Kremlin would know who would gain control of each<br />
   company would keep anyone hostile to Russian<br />
   (read: Kremlin) interests out. The last thing<br />
   Kudrin wants is a new generation of oligarchs.<br />
<br />
   Kudrin's plan would start with selling the<br />
   state's stakes in companies purchased during the<br />
   financial crisis, such as telecommunications<br />
   giant Rostelecom and a series of banks, including<br />
   Globex, Svyaz and Sobinbank. After that, the<br />
   civiliki would like to consider companies such as<br />
   oil giant Rosneft, banking giant Sberbank and<br />
   railway monopoly Russian Railways for<br />
   privatization -- a rather bold move since many of<br />
   these companies are run by the siloviki.<br />
<br />
   In Putin's mind, the state consolidated the<br />
   economy during Russia's identity crisis in the<br />
   1990s. Certain people, groups, influences and<br />
   companies needed to be purged, in his opinion.<br />
   Now that this has been completed, the government<br />
   can step back and, in a highly controlled manner,<br />
   start to reprivatize businesses. Putin is<br />
   starting to believe that this is all just a cycle.<br />
<br />
   Easier Said Than Done<br />
<br />
   Kudrin and the other civiliki's plans are a<br />
   technocratic approach to a crisis that has been<br />
   long in the making in Russia but was exacerbated<br />
   by the global financial crisis. The civiliki's<br />
   plans have very specific economic goals in mind,<br />
   leaving out power politics. The plan is actually<br />
   not a new one, but it is one that the siloviki<br />
   have continually sidelined over the years as they<br />
   placed national interests above economic reform.<br />
   The civiliki have also never been powerful enough<br />
   by themselves (even with one of their own as<br />
   president of the country) to push through any of their reforms.<br />
<br />
   What the civiliki needed was for one of the truly<br />
   powerful clan leaders in Russia to stand behind<br />
   their reforms. Fortunately for Kudrin and the<br />
   civiliki, one such leader -- Surkov, who serves<br />
   as Medvedev's deputy chief of staff and first<br />
   aide to Putin -- has done just that. However,<br />
   Surkov is not interested in Kudrin's plan in<br />
   order to reform the Russian economy. He sees the<br />
   plan as something that will help him eliminate<br />
   his rivals and consolidate his power.<br />

   Russia's last independent TV stations to move into Kremlin-owned studios<br />
   Russia's National Media Group cites economic<br />
   motives in moving REN TV and the outspoken St.<br />
   Petersburg Channel Five. But critics worry the<br />
   partnering move with Russia Today may presage a loss of editorial freedom.<br />
   By Fred Weir | Correspondent<br />
   Moscow<br />
<br />
   Russia's last two independent TV voices, citing<br />
   financial distress, have announced a major<br />
   &quot;restructuring&quot; that may involve partnering with<br />
   state agencies, with what many liberal critics<br />
   fear could be an inevitable loss of editorial freedom.<br />
<br />
   Officials of the National Media Group, which owns<br />
   the independent REN TV and the outspoken St.<br />
   Petersburg Channel Five, insist they're just<br />
   looking for economic efficiencies in the reported<br />
   plans to move REN's operations into a giant<br />
   Moscow TV center run by the Kremlin's pocket news<br />
   agency, RIA-Novosti, and home to its 24-hour<br />
   English-language satellite TV station Russia<br />
   Today (RT). But liberals say they've seen this<br />
   happen several times before, beginning with the<br />
   Kremlin's stealthy use of a commercial dispute to<br />
   take over the only nonstate nationwide TV<br />
   network, NTV, at the beginning of the Vladimir Putin era in 2001.<br />
<br />
   &quot;These two small channels are the very last<br />
   islands of media freedom in Russia, and if they<br />
   are to be restructured in the ways we have seen,<br />
   all too often in the past, they will become part<br />
   of the official propaganda machine,&quot; says<br />
   Vladimir Ryzhkov, a former independent Duma<br />
   deputy. &quot;We are all watching this process with<br />
   deep fears that, once again, economic<br />
   optimization will actually lead to censorship. In<br />
   Russia's TV landscape today, there is basically no freedom.&quot;<br />
<br />
   Russia Today: technical support, editorial influence?<br />
<br />
   In the past, the Kremlin's chosen vehicle for<br />
   taking over critical media assets was the<br />
   state-owned natural-gas goliath, Gazprom, but<br />
   today liberals are pointing their fingers at a<br />
   surprising new culprit: Russia Today. Started up<br />
   less than four years ago as a Kremlin project to<br />
   counter Western &quot;misperceptions&quot; about Russia, RT<br />
   has burgeoned under a lavish flow of state<br />
   funding into a huge operation that now boasts an<br />
   Arabic-language service and a soon-to-launch<br />
   Spanish service. According to the station's<br />
   editor-in-chief, Margarita Simonyan, a new US<br />
   branch of RT is set to begin broadcasting from<br />
   studios in Washington, D.C., in January, and will<br />
   be running special US-oriented programming, 24/7, within a year.<br />
<br />
   Ms. Simonyan says it's logical that little<br />
   stations like REN TV would want to partner with<br />
   RT, because the English-language station now<br />
   possesses one of the most modern and<br />
   sophisticated broadcasting centers in the country.<br />
<br />
   &quot;Because of this, we can support them<br />
   technologically,&quot; she says. &quot;We are not going to<br />
   interfere with their editorial content. That's not the idea at all.&quot;<br />
<br />
   That pledge is also offered by officials of the<br />
   two beleaguered stations, who say they are forced<br />
   to make radical changes due to sagging<br />
   advertising revenues and rising shareholder<br />
   demands to show a profit. &quot;We need to find new<br />
   premises for REN TV, and we may outsource some<br />
   technical functions,&quot; says Asya Pomeranets, a<br />
   company public relations representative. &quot;But the<br />
   stations will retain their distinctive content.&quot;<br />
<br />
   Simonyan argues that RT, which offers a variety<br />
   of news, talk and documentary programming, itself<br />
   enjoys &quot;absolute editorial independence&quot; from its<br />
   main financial sponsor, the Kremlin. &quot;What we do<br />
   is offer a different view of the world, a list of<br />
   stories you won't see covered in the mainstream<br />
   media,&quot; she says. &quot;Our goal is to do good<br />
   journalism and increase our audience, and not to please someone up there.&quot;<br />
<br />
   'I never thought I'd see this day'<br />
<br />
   Still, giant state-funded broadcasters like RT<br />
   are thriving, while little independent outlets<br />
   like REN are gasping for air, and that points to<br />
   an inevitable outcome, some experts argue.<br />
<br />
   &quot;What RT makes is a packaged propaganda product,<br />
   which is bought and paid for by the Kremlin,&quot;<br />
   says Alexei Samokhvalov, a former director of REN<br />
   TV who now heads the independent National TV and<br />
   Radio Research Center in Moscow.<br />
<br />
   &quot;In another country, it might seem normal for TV<br />
   stations to share technical facilities while<br />
   maintaining separate editorial lines, but in<br />
   Russia it does not work that way,&quot; Mr. Samokhvalov says.<br />
<br />
   &quot;If REN TV moves into the RT's headquarters, and<br />
   becomes dependent upon them for its very<br />
   existence, it will lose its independence. When I<br />
   was director of REN TV, we prized our<br />
   independence. I never thought I'd see this day,&quot; he adds.<br />
<br />
   REN TV has grown from a tiny independent station<br />
   into a nationwide TV network that now enjoys<br />
   about 6 percent of Russia's market share, a tiny<br />
   blip compared with the three state-owned TV<br />
   behemoths, but beloved to Russian liberals<br />
   because of its relatively independent editorial stance.<br />
<br />
   &quot;If you compare with the other media outlets, REN<br />
   is by far the most liberal, most outspoken, and<br />
   shows the greatest degree of independence,&quot; says<br />
   Vladimir Pozner, a leading Russian TV<br />
   personality. &quot;If it were to lose its<br />
   independence, I would find that very disheartening.&quot;<br />
<br />
   Kremlin media crackdown<br />
<br />
   When Vladimir Putin came to power, nearly a<br />
   decade ago, he began cracking down on Russia's<br />
   once diverse and combative media spectrum, using<br />
   economic levers of influence rather than<br />
   Soviet-style brute force to corral journalists,<br />
   critics have long said. The state-backed takeover<br />
   of NTV by Gazprom produced a chilling effect on<br />
   TV broadcasters around the country. The Kremlin<br />
   subsequently orchestrated the downfall of smaller<br />
   TV networks that failed to come to heel,<br />
   including TV-6 in 2002 and TVS the following<br />
   year. Some public opinion services, which provide<br />
   journalists with raw information, were also<br />
   brought under state control, leaving only a<br />
   handful of small-circulation outfits, such as the<br />
   liberal Ekho Moskvi radio station, that some<br />
   critics say are allowed to exist as political window-dressing.<br />
<br />
   &quot;Very clearly, the government wants that kind of<br />
   window to remain open, because it's a way of<br />
   saying 'Hey, we have democracy in Russia,' to the<br />
   rest of the world,&quot; says Mr. Pozner. &quot;Maybe they<br />
   see REN TV playing this kind of role, and perhaps that will save it.&quot;<br />
<br />
   Russia's beleaguered liberals, who have watched<br />
   the political landscape turn into a Sovietesque<br />
   one-party show under Putin and his successor,<br />
   Dmitri Medvedev, say they hold out little hope<br />
   for the survival of the last media holdouts.<br />
<br />
   &quot;Unfortunately, everything that has happened on<br />
   the TV media front since Putin became president<br />
   in 2000 suggests that the last vestiges of<br />
   independent television will be muzzled as well,&quot; says Mr. Ryzhkov.<br />

   Switching channels<br />
   By Mark H. Teeter<br />

<br />
   Most Russians don't get their news from<br />
   newspapers, as polls regularly tell us, so the<br />
   majority of the country's info-consumers probably<br />
   missed Kommersant's recent warning that they'd<br />
   soon be getting less-varied daily dispatches from<br />
   their medium of choice - television. The<br />
   respected business daily reported on Oct. 16 that<br />
   a top-down reorganization of Moscow-based REN TV<br />
   and Petersburg - Channel 5 (the last two<br />
   nationally-available privately-owned channels<br />
   producing their own news broadcasts) meant the<br />
   stations would be abandoning news gathering next<br />
   year, allegedly as an economy move, and instead<br />
   airing news segments produced by RT, the state-funded 24-hour news<br />
   channel.<br />
<br />
   If this apparent final centralisation of Russian<br />
   TV news operations didn't sound ominous enough in<br />
   itself, the Orwellian euphemism used to describe<br />
   it by one interested party (&quot;an optimisation of<br />
   the management structure&quot;) and the<br />
   self-appointment of another as the project's<br />
   &quot;chief ideologist&quot; surely coloured in the<br />
   numbered spaces for even casual observers. In a word: yikes.<br />
<br />
   Granted, in the days following the Kommersant<br />
   report two prominent REN TV representatives<br />
   maintained that the reorganisation would not<br />
   affect news programming. Still and all, it's hard<br />
   not to see this progression as handwriting on the<br />
   wall - and not least because it will put the two<br />
   stations literally within the same walls and<br />
   under the same roof that RT already enjoys, at<br />
   the RIA Novosti agency's headquarters on Zubovsky Bulvar.<br />
<br />
   It makes sense to be concerned about any<br />
   diminution, actual or potential, of Russia's<br />
   ever-uncertain prospects for a civil society. But<br />
   it also makes sense to keep three points in<br />
   perspective as the REN TV/Channel 5 scenario<br />
   actually plays out. Americans in particular would<br />
   be wise to wait for the reorganisational smoke to<br />
   clear before making judgments, as recent excesses<br />
   in US news broadcasting have done much to render<br />
   American television reporting more vulnerable to<br />
   criticism - and less attractive as a paradigm - than ever before.<br />
<br />
   First, would the Russian consolidation really<br />
   represent, as one local observer immediately<br />
   characterised it, &quot;a return to one of the worst<br />
   aspects of the Soviet past, in which most people<br />
   will have access to only one version of news&quot;?<br />
<br />
   In fact, this &quot;final centralisation&quot; would<br />
   actually be less final and less centralised than<br />
   it might appear. Even with TV news sourced solely<br />
   by state outlets, any Muscovite who doesn't like<br />
   it can easily turn on various electronic options,<br />
   including the round-the-clock, Russian-language<br />
   Euronews TV channel (my own choice for viewing<br />
   over breakfast) and the editorially independent<br />
   Ekho Moskvy radio station (where my kitchen<br />
   radio's dial is set). If those aren't enough, the<br />
   world's news in the world's own terms is no<br />
   further from most Russians than a laptop or their<br />
   local Internet cafe. How many international TV<br />
   stations are available now through any high-speed<br />
   cable hook-up - a thousand? Two?<br />
<br />
   Second, Russian state TV is not - and can't<br />
   become - Soviet state TV. The latter was a<br />
   genuine monolith that largely deserved the 1950s<br />
   joke about its &quot;diversity&quot;: Channel 1 was all<br />
   propaganda, while Channel 2 showed a man telling<br />
   viewers to turn back to Channel 1. Today's state<br />
   channels can occasionally diverge in their<br />
   reporting, as Channel 1 and NTV did last week<br />
   over Gazprom's controversial Okhta tower in St.<br />
   Petersburg. Various talk shows and documentaries,<br />
   moreover, can be quite frank and utterly<br />
   un-Soviet in their criticism of state<br />
   institutions and government authorities - and<br />
   these are not solely the province of the<br />
   intelligentsia-oriented Kultura channel.<br />
<br />
   Thirdly, the proximate monopolist alleged in the<br />
   REN TV/Channel 5 case, RT, is itself a diverse<br />
   and self-critical institution. (Full disclosure:<br />
   RT and The Moscow News share a sibling<br />
   relationship within the RIA Novosti/TV Novosti<br />
   family. Fuller disclosure: I once appeared as a<br />
   paid talking head on an RT news analysis<br />
   programme. Fullest disclosure: I stunk.) Stinking<br />
   aside, any state channel that would put me on the<br />
   air live, given what I've written about state TV<br />
   here over the years, is either commendably<br />
   diverse and self-critical already or willing to get egg on its face<br />
   trying.<br />
<br />
   OK, now let's get cross-cultural for a moment. A<br />
   reduction in reporting perspectives is an<br />
   unfortunate development anywhere, of course - or<br />
   is it? If you've recently returned from (another)<br />
   visa exile to the United States, as I have, it's<br />
   hard not to make some comparisons that are fairly<br />
   unflattering to the post-Cronkite generation of<br />
   your historic homeland's TV news.<br />
<br />
   Last week a Pulitzer Prize for Shoddy Reporting<br />
   should have gone to the myriad national TV<br />
   broadcasters who fell for and perpetuated two<br />
   utterly bogus &quot;stories&quot; - of a boy supposedly<br />
   trapped alone in a balloon somewhere over<br />
   Colorado (when he was in fact hiding out in the<br />
   family home on orders from his publicity-hound<br />
   parents); and of a US Chamber of Commerce<br />
   announcement that the organisation had suddenly<br />
   reconsidered its longstanding opposition to<br />
   measures against global warning - when it had<br />
   done no such thing. In both cases, the need to<br />
   get on the air first, or at least fast, with<br />
   something &quot;truthy&quot;, to borrow news satirist<br />
   Stephen Colbert's wonderful coinage, trumped any<br />
   impulse the TV reporters and producers might have<br />
   felt to take a longer look at these<br />
   suspicious-sounding non-events before promoting<br />
   them into air-worthy news items.<br />
<br />
   OK, hoaxes happen everywhere, maybe this was just<br />
   a bad week. That doesn't account for the giant<br />
   hoax known as Fox News, a rabidly partisan<br />
   political concern that has been masquerading as a<br />
   network news organisation for some years now. If<br />
   any doubt as to Fox's real status persisted as<br />
   late as 2008, right-wing crowds at last year's<br />
   presidential campaign rallies dispelled it with<br />
   frenzied rhythmic chanting - &quot;Fox News! Fox News!<br />
   Fox News!&quot; - quite as though the network itself were running for<br />
   something.<br />
<br />
   And maybe it is. How else would you decode the<br />
   work of &quot;commentator&quot; and Republican functionary<br />
   Sean Hannity, who uses his Fox News slot to<br />
   organise, publicise and then &quot;analyse&quot;<br />
   anti-administration rallies? Or the excesses of<br />
   Fox-friendly Rush Limbaugh, who spent much energy<br />
   last week airing citations from what he<br />
   mistakenly took as Barack Obama's &quot;college<br />
   thesis&quot; - and then &quot;explaining&quot; that his use of<br />
   hoax-quotes didn't matter, since they certainly<br />
   reflected what Obama had been thinking [!]. You<br />
   want to talk Orwellian? Fox's slogan is &quot;Fair and balanced.&quot;<br />
<br />
   Yet even these whoppers  are trumped by Foxman<br />
   Glenn Beck, whose incendiary, screw-loose ranting<br />
   - over President Obama's &quot;deep-seated hatred for<br />
   white people&quot;, for example, presumably including<br />
   his own mother - alternately tests the limits of<br />
   American credulity and US libel laws, all for the<br />
   entertainment of a large, growing and angrily<br />
   undiscriminating TV audience. If you can imagine<br />
   the ultra-nationalist gadfly Vladimir Zhirinovsky<br />
   suddenly getting perhaps twice the TV exposure of<br />
   Channel 1's incorrigible crank-commentator<br />
   Mikhail Leontyev, you can perhaps begin to sense<br />
   what the phenomenon of Glenn Beck bodes for the<br />
   future of American newscasting.<br />
<br />
   Yes, &quot;scary&quot; is the word you're looking for. This<br />
   self-acknowledged media &quot;rodeo clown,&quot; with a<br />
   history of alcoholism, drug abuse and religious<br />
   zealotry, makes Zhirinovsky seem articulate and<br />
   Leontyev positively Socratic. Yikes again.<br />
<br />
   If there was any good news about the news in<br />
   recent days, perhaps it was that two prominent US<br />
   journalism professors produced a timely and<br />
   possibly eye-opening essay in the Washington Post<br />
   titled &quot;Finding a new model for news reporting.&quot;<br />
   The piece was condensed from a larger report that<br />
   warned quite soberingly, if belatedly, that<br />
   traditional journalism &quot;is now at risk&quot; and that<br />
   &quot;preserving independent, original, credible<br />
   reporting, whether or not it is profitable&quot; is of<br />
   &quot;paramount&quot; importance for the country. And not just that one, of course.<br />
<br />
   TV news practices in both these societies need<br />
   serious scrutiny - and soon, before a dearth of<br />
   independence debilitates one and an unconstrained<br />
   profusion of it further debases the other. Put<br />
   otherwise, near-monopoly and near-anarchy should<br />
   both be averted: if Channel One is a problem, Fox News is not the<br />
   solution.<br />

   Blue October<br />
   By Tim Wall<br />
   Editor, Moscow News<br />
<br />
   The recession may be over, but the blues just won't go away.<br />
<br />
   First there was the mess over local elections,<br />
   where President Dmitry Medvedev stepped in to<br />
   sort out a growing row over allegations of<br />
   cheating by regional authorities - from Moscow<br />
   City Hall on down. The final straw for opposition<br />
   parties was the revelation that even Yabloko<br />
   party leader Sergei Mitrokhin's own vote was<br />
   mysteriously trashed - leaving the liberal party<br />
   with null points in his own district.<br />
<br />
   After an abortive parliamentary boycott, the<br />
   country's loyal opposition parties (the Liberal<br />
   Democrats, Just Russia and the Communists) were<br />
   appeased with the promise that election rules<br />
   would be tweaked to give them a (slightly) better shake of the dice.<br />
<br />
   But the biggest result is likely to be<br />
   intensified pressure on Moscow Mayor Yury<br />
   Luzhkov, who is fighting to keep his job amid a<br />
   chorus of grumbling - apparently originating from close to the Kremlin.<br />
<br />
   Next, the country's car industry continued to<br />
   fall apart, with AvtoVAZ announcing more than<br />
   20,000 job losses amid a car-sales freefall.<br />
   Sberbank's Opel deal - aimed at rescuing more<br />
   jobs, particularly at GAZ's Nizhny Novgorod plant<br />
   - also faltered, with GM having second thoughts.<br />
<br />
   Then, just to make matters worse, the oligarchs<br />
   have started scrapping in public again. This time<br />
   it was a debt-laden Oleg Deripaska complaining to<br />
   the Kremlin about judicial corruption. Clearly<br />
   frustrated, Medvedev tried to keep the peace by<br />
   putting both Deripaska and Mikhail Fridman in<br />
   their places, but the squabbles don't make his job any easier.<br />
<br />
   There is some good news, of course. The<br />
   authorities expect quarter-on-quarter GDP growth<br />
   of 3 to 4 per cent in the last three months of<br />
   2009, while Prime Minister Vladimir Putin went<br />
   one better, predicting an absolute halt in<br />
   inflation until the end of the year. And the<br />
   budget deficit for 2010 is likely to be less<br />
   severe, thanks to the current surge in oil prices to $80 a barrel.<br />
<br />
   But this must be tempered with caution, as the<br />
   tentative recovery so closely depends on what happens in the rest of the<br />
   world<br />
<br />
   The printing of money by governments from the US<br />
   to China has so far averted a 1929-style crash.<br />
   But it may be fuelling a new stock market and<br />
   commodities bubble that could burst again at any time.<br />
<br />
   And if that happens, the Kremlin's current blues<br />
   will look like a pleasant distraction.<br />

   Mafia is mortal<br />
   Russia has adopted Italian methods of fighting the a**godfathersa**<br />
   By Vladislav Kulikov<br />
<br />
   The Ministry of Justice of the Russian Federation<br />
   is studying Italian methods of fighting the mafia<br />
   in order to apply them on Russian soil. Perhaps<br />
   the experience of foreign commissioners of<br />
   Catania, Sicily might prove useful with our Zheglovs and Sharapovs.<br />
<br />
   As Aleksandr Konovalov, the Minister of Justice,<br />
   reported to Rossiyskaya Gazeta (RG) yesterday,<br />
   the Russian Ministry of Justice, along with the<br />
   Ministry of Justice of Italy, is preparing a<br />
   large-scale program of cooperation. It not only<br />
   includes strictly official functions, but an<br />
   exchange of experience and concrete steps toward<br />
   implementing new technologies in the fight<br />
   against organized crime and corruption as well as<br />
   innovative methods of executing judicial orders.<br />
<br />
   One of the suggestions is to leave the godfathers<br />
   without a penny to their name. Italian Minister<br />
   of Justice, Angelino Alfano a** who met with<br />
   Alexandr Konovalov and Russiaa**s Prosecutor<br />
   General, Yuri Chaika, in Moscow yesterday a**<br />
   shared information on the technologies that will<br />
   enable law enforcement agencies to do this.<br />
<br />
   a**In any country, organized crime is focused on<br />
   obtaining illegal profits,a** said Angelino Alfano.<br />
   a**Therefore, a strategy for combating organized<br />
   crime, which has been very successful in Italy,<br />
   had been formulated at the last G8 summit.a**<br />
<br />
   According to Alfano, Italian law-enforcement<br />
   agents confiscated a*NOT5 billion worth of property from mafia bosses.<br />
<br />
   Another a*NOT1 billion of liquid assets was<br />
   confiscated from the godfathers and their<br />
   subordinates. Ita**s highly unlikely that Russian<br />
   organized crime leaders are poorer than their<br />
   Italian counterparts. Confiscation of assets<br />
   could also be a good method of fighting<br />
   corruption, as well. The know-how of Italian<br />
   law-enforcement officials includes implementing<br />
   the confiscated funds from the mafia to fight the<br />
   very same mafia. Russia's Ministry of Justice is<br />
   currently considering Italya**s regulatory framework.<br />
<br />
   According to Alexandr Konovalov, a global<br />
   approach in the fight against organized crime<br />
   should be the destruction of its financial base<br />
   and confiscation of its property.<br />
<br />
   Interestingly, Russia and Italy share many common<br />
   problems in their legal sphere, such as lengthy<br />
   civil trials and overcrowded jails. Therefore,<br />
   law-enforcement agencies of the two countries are<br />
   considering the experience of alternative<br />
   punishments. And Italy is interested in our court<br />
   proceedings where video conferencing has been implemented.<br />
<br />
   Yesterday, the Russian Minister of Justice also<br />
   disclosed the details of a bill on federal<br />
   compensation to victims of terrorist attacks.<br />
   According to Konovalov, there will not be a<br />
   uniform formula for calculating the compensations<br />
   following all terrorist acts. Meanwhile, the<br />
   state will focus on the practices of the European<br />
   Court of Human Rights, so victims of terrorist<br />
   attacks should receive payments comparable to the<br />
   European payments. Thus, the most difficult<br />
   negotiations regarding the bill are yet to come in the Ministry of<br />
   Finance.<br />
<br />
   Direct Conversation:<br />
<br />
   Alexandr Konovalov, Minister of Justice of Russia:<br />
<br />
   a**The program, which we are preparing for final<br />
   approval, involves concrete and pragmatic steps.<br />
   We believe that this collaboration will be<br />
   greatly beneficial for our countries and promote<br />
   cooperation between our peoples.<br />
<br />
   a**Italy and Russia will study the outcomes of<br />
   draft legislation that uses innovative<br />
   technologies in the field of justice. Another<br />
   important issue is alternative methods of<br />
   delivering judicial orders in criminal cases. In<br />
   this aspect, Russia and Italy share some common<br />
   problems a** exceedingly lengthy civil court trials and overcrowded jails.<br />
<br />
   a**The experience of our Italian colleagues in the<br />
   fight against organized crime also inspires<br />
   respect. Organized crime requires a united and<br />
   technologically advanced response from law<br />
   enforcement agencies, as well as respect for the rule of law and due<br />
   process.<br />
<br />
   The fight against organized crime should be<br />
   carried out comprehensively and systemically.a**<br />

   Poll reveals lack of interest in trial of former Yukos boss<br />
   Interfax<br />
<br />
   Moscow, 26 October: The number of Russians who do<br />
   not understand charges against former Yukos (oil<br />
   company) bosses Mikhail Khodorkovskiy and Platon<br />
   Lebedev is higher than the number of those who<br />
   understand what the two men are being accused of<br />
   during the new trial, shows a public opinion poll.<br />
<br />
   According to the results of the nationwide poll,<br />
   conducted by the Levada-Centre agency in October<br />
   and made public in Moscow, two-thirds of those<br />
   polled (67 per cent) did not understand what the<br />
   charges were about or found it difficult to<br />
   answer the question. Compare<br />
