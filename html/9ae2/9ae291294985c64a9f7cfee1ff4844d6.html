		<h3>Tor</h3>
		<p><a href="https://www.torproject.org">Tor</a> is an encrypted anonymising network that makes it harder to intercept internet communications, or see where communications are coming from or going to.</p>
		<p>In order to use the WikiLeaks public submission system as detailed above you can download the Tor Browser Bundle, which is a Firefox-like browser available for Windows, Mac OS X and GNU/Linux and pre-configured to connect using the anonymising system Tor.</p>
		<h4>Tails</h4>
		<p>If you are at high risk and you have the capacity to do so, you can also access the submission system through a secure operating system called <a href="https://tails.boum.org">Tails</a>. Tails is an operating system launched from a USB stick or a DVD that aim to leaves no traces when the computer is shut down after use and automatically routes your internet traffic through Tor. Tails will require you to have either a USB stick or a DVD at least 4GB big and a laptop or desktop computer.</p>

		<h3>Tips</h3>
		<p>Our submission system works hard to preserve your anonymity, but we recommend you also take some of your own precautions. Please review these basic guidelines. </p>
		<div>
			<h4>1. Contact us if you have specific problems</h4>
			<p>If you have a very large submission, or a submission with a complex format, or are a high-risk source, please <a href="#submit_help_contact">contact us</a>. In our experience it is always possible to find a custom solution for even the most seemingly difficult situations.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h4>2. What computer to use</h4>
			<p>If the computer you are uploading from could subsequently be audited in an investigation, consider using a computer that is not easily tied to you. Technical users can also use <a href="https://tails.boum.org">Tails</a> to help ensure you do not leave any records of your submission on the computer.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h4>3. Do not talk about your submission to others</h4>
			<p>If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in source protection – it is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This includes other media organisations.</p>
		</div>

	</div>

		<h3>After</h3>

		<div>
			<h4>1. Do not talk about your submission to others</h4>
			<p>If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in source protection – it is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This includes other media organisations.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h4>2. Act normal</h4>
			<p>If you are a high-risk source, avoid saying anything or doing anything after submitting which might promote suspicion. In particular, you should try to stick to your normal routine and behaviour.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h4>3. Remove traces of your submission</h4>
			<p>If you are a high-risk source and the computer you prepared your submission on, or uploaded it from, could subsequently be audited in an investigation, we recommend that you format and dispose of the computer hard drive and any other storage media you used.</p>
			<p>In particular, hard drives retain data after formatting which may be visible to a digital forensics team and flash media (USB sticks, memory cards and SSD drives) retain data even after a secure erasure. If you used flash media to store sensitive data, it is important to destroy the media.</p>
			<p>If you do this and are a high-risk source you should make sure there are no traces of the clean-up, since such traces themselves may draw suspicion.</p>
			<div>
				<h4>4. If you face legal action</h4>
				<p>If a legal action is brought against you as a result of your submission, there are organisations that may help you. The Courage Foundation is an international organisation dedicated to the protection of journalistic sources. You can find more details at <a href="https://www.couragefound.org">https://www.couragefound.org</a>.</p>

		<p>WikiLeaks publishes documents of political or historical importance that are censored or otherwise suppressed. We specialise in strategic global publishing and large archives.</p>
		<p>The following is the address of our secure site where you can anonymously upload your documents to WikiLeaks editors. You can only access this submissions system through Tor. (See our <a href="#submit_help_tor">Tor tab</a> for more information.) We also advise you to read our <a href="#submit_help_tips">tips for sources</a> before submitting.</p>

			<!--<div>
				Copy this address into your Tor browser. Advanced users, if they wish, can also add a further layer of encryption to their submission using <a href="#submit_wlkey">our public PGP key</a>.
			</div>-->
		</div>

		<p>If you cannot use Tor, or your submission is very large, or you have specific requirements, WikiLeaks provides several alternative methods. <a href="#submit_help_contact">Contact us</a> to discuss how to proceed.</p>

FOLLOWING IS A TRANSCRIPT OF CODEL CURTIS' NOVEMBER 22 PRESS
CONFERENCE IN HONG KONG AS REQUESTED REFTEL.
SENATOR CURTIS
I WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE GENTLEMEN OF THE PRESS FOR BEING HERE.
WE ARE TRAVELLING ON A PRESIDENTIAL MISSION; WE WERE APPOINTED BY
PRESIDENT FORD.  I WOULD LIKE TO INTRODUCE MY COLLEAGUES - ON MY
RIGHT IS THE VICE CHAIRMAN OF THE DELEGATION, SENATOR BAYH OF
INDIANA, NEXT TO HIM IS SENATOR HOLLINGS OF SOUTH CAROLINA, SENATOR
JOHNSTON OF LOUISIANA, SENATOR MILTON YOUNG OF NORTH DAKOTA AND
SENATOR STEPHENS OF ALASKA.  I HAVE A BRIEF STATEMENT:  EVERYONE
WILL SPEAK FOR THEMSELVES IN THIS PRESS CONFERENCE BUT WE HAVE MADE
NO RECORDERS OF THE COMMITTEE.  WE HAVE MET WITH VICE PREMIER LEE
AND WITH THE VICE MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS, MISS WONG.  WE SPENT
TWO WEEKS IN CHINA; WE WERE AT SHANGHAI, NANKING, PEKING, ....(IN-
AUDIBLE) PLUS VISITING OF COMMUNES AND THE COUNTRYSIDE.  THE
PEOPLE ARE WARM AND FRIENDLY; THE CHINESE PEOPLE WHOM WE SAW
APPEARED HAPPY, HEALTHY AND WELL FED.  THEIR SYSTEM OF AGRICULTURE
SERVES A DUAL PURPOSE - THEY ARE NEAR SELF SUFFICIENT IN FOOD AND
IT PROVIDES EMPLOYMENT FOR THEIR PEOPLE.  WE VISITED SEVERAL
FACTORIES AND FOUND A CONSIDERABLE DEGREE OF SOPHISTICATION IN
THEIR OPERATION.  IT APPEARS CLEAR THAT THE CHANGE IN CHINA'S
LEADERSHIP CAUSED BY THE DEATH OF MAO TSE TUNG AND THE ADVANCE OF

CHAIRMAN HUA HAS NOT CHANGED THEHDIRECTION OF CHINA TOWARD THE
UNITED STATES.  COOPERATION WITH THE UNITED STATES UNDER CHAIRMAN
HUA WILL CONTINUE.  THE CHINESE LEADERS REPEATEDLY VOICED THEIR
DISTRUST OF THE SOVIETS; IN THEIR BELIEF IT IS THE SOVIET'S DESIRE
TO EXPAND THEIR TERRITORY.  THE CHINESE EXPRESSED A DESIRE FOR PEACE
AND STATED THAT THEY DID NOT WISH TO EXTEND THEIR OWN TARRITORY AND
IF THE SOVIETS SHOULD ATTACK THEM, THAT THE SOVIETS WOULD SUFFER
DEFEAT.  THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA'S POSITION ON TAIWAN HAS
NOT CHANGED AND WAS FREQUENTLY MENTIONED BUT THEY STATED THAT THE
WORLD AFFAIRS, THAT IS THE THREAT OF VOVIET EXPANSION IN ASIA,
EUROPE AND ELSEWHERE WAS THE ISSUE OF FIRST IMPORTANCE.  THERE WERE
DISCUSSIONS ON TRADE AND A CONTINUATION OF EXCHANGE OF BUSINESS.
THE GREATEST POSSIBILITY FOR U.S. EXPORTS TO CHINA PERHAPS ARE
PLANTS AND MACHINES BUT WE CONVEYED TO THEM THE DESIRE TO SELL THEM
GRAIN, THAT WHICH THEY'D NEED TO IMPORT.  WE ALSO EXPRESSED AN
INTEREST IN THEIR OIL DEVELOPMENT AND SUGGESTED AN EXCHANGE OF
GRAIN FOR OIL OR OTHER AMERICAN PRODUCTS.
QUESTION:  SIR, COULD YOU TELL US SPECIFICALLY WHAT METHODS YOU ARE
TAKING BACK TO THE WHITE HOUSE REGARDING SINO-AMERICAN RELATIONS
AND SPECIFICALLY THE RECOGNITION ISSUE?
SENATOR CURTIS ANSWER:  I DIDN'T HEAR THE LAST PART.
QUESTION:  COULD YOU TELL US WHAT METHODS YOU ARE TAKING BACK TO THE
WHITE HOUSE REGARDING THE RECOGNITION ISSUE?
SENATOR CURTIS ANSWER:  WE WILL GIVE THEM A REPORT SOMEWHAT AS I
STATED HERE, WE WILL ACT INDIVIDUALLY ON THAT.  WE INFORMED, I
INFORMED THE CHINESE OF MY POSITION THAT THE QUESTION OF TAIWAN
WAS A PROBLEM FOR US AND WE HOPED THAT IT COULD BE WORKED OUT
PEACEABLY.
QUESTION:  SENATOR MANSFIELD THIS MORNING, ACCORDING TO REPORTS,N
APPEARS TO FEEL THAT IT IS A MATTER THAT WANTS TO BE SORTED OUT
FAIRLY URGENTLY.  DO ANY OF YOU FEEL THE SAME WAY?
SENATOR CURTIS ANSWER:  I DO NOT AGREE WITH THE MANSFIELD
STATEMENT.  HIS LONG TIME OBJECTIVE IS ANOTHER MATTER.  THE ABRO-
GATION OF A TREATY IS A SERIOUS ACTION AND I AM NOT PREPARED TO DO
MY PART IN COMMITTING OUR GOVERNMENT TO SUCH A COURSE AT THIS TIME.
QUESTION:  DO ANY OF THE OTHER SENATORS HERE FEEL THAT THEY ARE?
SENATOR BAYH ANSWER:  LET ME JUST, IF I MIGHT JUST SAY, I THINK
SENATOR KERR'S OPENING STATEMENT PRETTY WELL HIT ALL THE HIGH
POINTS.  I THINK I CAN SAY FOR ALL OF US THAT WHEN YOU GO THROUGH
AN EXPERIENCE LIKE THIS, AND WHEN YOU COME OUT YOU REALISE THE
BASIC DIFFERENCES THAT DISTINGUISH A CLOSED SOCIETY FROM A FREE
UNCLASSIFIED

PAGE 03        HONG K 14021  01 OF 04  021406Z

SOCIETY AND YOU THANK GOD ONCE AGAIN FOR LIVING IN A FREE SOCIETY.
THOSE OF US WHO COME TO TAKE FOR GRANTED SOME OF THE BASIC FREEDOMS
THAT WE HAVE NEVERTHELESS I THINK HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THAT PEOPLE
WHO LIVE IN THE COUNTRY HAVE NEVER UNDERSTOOD OR KNOWN THOSE
FREEDOMS, DON'T PLACE THE KIND OF VALUE ON THEM THAT WE DO.  I
THINK THE NEW ADMINISTRATION SHOULD REMAIN COMMITTED TO THE
FULFILMENT OF THE SHARING HIGH ACCORD.  I FRANKLY BELIEVE - AND I
HAVE THE GREATEST RESPECT FOR SENATOR MANSFIELD, AND THIS STATEMENT
OF HIS IS NOT A NEW STATEMENT, HE HAS THOUGHT THIS WAY A LONG WHILE
- I FRANKLY BELIEVE THAT WITH NEW LEADERSHIP IN CHINA AND NEW
LEADERSHIP IN THE UNITED STATES, THAT PRECIPITOUS ACTION RIGHT NOW
IS UNREALISTIC AND WE ARE GOING TO GO THROUGH A PERIOD WHERE BOTH
SETS OF NEW LEADERS GET MORE FAMILIAR WITH ONE ANOTHER AND I HOPE
THAT BOTH UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE OF LONG TIME NORMALISATION IN
RELATIONSHIPS.  I SENSED, AS I THINK SENATOR CURTIS MENTIONED THAT
ALL OF US, THAT EVERYBODY SHOULD SPEAK FOR THEMSELVES, THAT I THINK
THERE IS A VERY STRONG FEELING AMONG THE OFFICIALS THAT WE SPOKE
WITH FOR A NORMALISATION OF RELATIONSHIPS.  WE TOLD THEM THAT WE
WANT NORMAL RELATIONSHIPS BUT THE PROBLEMS ARE AS GREAT NOW AS THEY
WERE BEFORE THE CHANGE OF LEADERS, AND I THINK IT IS GOING TO BE A
STEP BY STEP RETURN TO
NORMALISATION INSTEAD OF AWAKENING AND
HAVING A PROCLAMATION ON THE PRESIDENT'S DESK, AS SAID TO ME.
SENATOR HOLLINGS ANSWER:  I THINK THE SAME THING - I THINK THE STEP
BY STEP PROCEDURE AND ONE OF CAUTION AND BEING DELIBERATE AND
CAREFUL AND CONSIDERATE IN OUR CONDUCT IS THE HIGHLIGHT OF HOW IT
IS TO BE DONE RATHER THAN URGENCY.  THE FACT OF THE MATTEJ IS THAT
IN THE DISCUSSIONS WE HAD WITH MR. LEE, I POINTED OUT TO HIM MYSELF
THAT WE WEREN'T GOING TO ABANDON OUR FRIENDS IN TAIWAN; WE RECOGNISE
THAT THE SHANGHAI COMMUNIQUE HAS STATED ONE CHINA BUT THE MATTER OF
NORMALISATION COULD ONLY COME ABOUT AS TENSIONS EASE AND I THOUGHT
IT WAS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF BOTH SIDES TO CREATE AN EASING OF TGOSE
TENSIONS - I DON'T THINK IT'S A SINGULAR AMERICAN PROBLEM, I THINK
IT'S A CHINESE PROBLEM AS WELL - AND THEY ARE GOING TO HAVE TO
MAKE A LITTLE PROGRESS OFTHEIR OWN AMONGST PEOPLE AND GIVE A FEELING
OF SECURITY AND PROTECTION OF COURSE TO OUR FRIENDS THERE BECAUSE
WE ARE JUST NOT GOING TO UP AND ABANDON TAIWAN, AND I THINK THAT'SD
CLEAR IN MY MIND AND I DON'T THINK THE NATIONAL CONGRESS OF PRESIDENT
CARTER HAS ANY IDEA OF ANY URGENCY TO MOVE IN WITH A TOTAL CUT OFF
OF OUR SECURITY TREATY.  I HAVEN'T SEEN THE MANSFIELD STATEMENT BUT
I WILL SAY THAT WE HAVE GOT TO GIVE CONSTANT CARE TO WHAT'S BEEN

ACCOMPLISHED OVER THE SHANGHAI COMMUNIQUE - WE CAN'T UST LET IT
LANGUISH - WE HAVE GOT TO GICE THE PROPER RECOGNITION AND ATTENTION
TO MAINLAND CHINA BUT THE URGENCY THAT SENATOR MANSFIELD TALKS OF,
I WOULD DISAGREE WITH.
QUESTION:  SENATOR, WHAT DID VICE PREMIER LEE SAY TO YOU WHEN HE
TOLD YOU THIS?
SENATOR HOLLINGS ANSWER:  WELL, HE TOLD ME THAT I WAS RIGHT WHEN I
SAID THERE WAS ONE CHINA BUT HE SAID ON THE MATTER OF, I WAS TRYING
TO EMPHASISE THE STEP BY STEP, NAMELY THAT THEY SHOULD SEND SIMILAR
DELEGATIONS AS OURS TO THE UNITED STATES, THAT WE SORT OF STEP UP
TRADE, HE SAID WELL WE COULDN'T SEND DELEGATIONS AS LONG AS THE
EMBASSY OF TAIWAN WAS THERE IN WASHINGTON, D.C., HE SAID IT WOULD BE
AN EMBARRASSMENT TO CHINA AND TO US.

SUBJECT: CODEL CURTIS PRESS CONFERENCE

REF: STATE 289148

SENATOR JOHNSTON ANSWER:  THEY SAID TWO THINGS I THINK THAT WERE
IMPORTANT ON THE TAIWAN ISSUE.  FIRST IN OUR MEETING WITH THE VICE
FOREIGN MINISTER, SHE SAID, IN DISCUSSING THE TAIWAN ISSUE, THAT
CHINA WOULD NOT AGREE TO A PEACEFUL SETTLEMENT OF THE TAIWAN ISSUE
AND SECONDLY, THE VICE PREMIER LEE STATED, AFTER A DISCUSSION FOR
SOME PERIOD OF TIME ON THE TAIWAN ISSUE, THAT TAIWAN WAS SECONDARY
AND RELATIONSHIPS WITH RESPECT TO RUSSIA WERE PRIMARY, SO THAT WHILE
THEY ARE COMMITTED TO REUNIFICATION AND ABSORPTION OF TAIWAN AND
WHILE THEY ARE NOT WILLING TO SAY THAT THEY WILL DO IT BY PEACEFUL
MEANS, NEVERTHELESS WHEN IT COMES RIGHT DOWN TO IT, THAT'S A
SECONDARY ISSUE WITH THEM AT THE PRESENT TIME AND RELATIONSHIPS AND
THEIR GLOBAL SECURITY ARE PRIMARY.
SENATOR BAYH ANSWER:  I DID NOT GET THE FEELING - EXCUSE ME, PARDON
ME FOR INTERRUPTING - I DID NOT GET THE FEELING THAT ANY OF THE
LEADERS THAT WE DISCUSSED THIS PROBLEM WITH EXPECTED THIS MATTER TO
BE RESOLVED IN A MATTER OF WEEKS OR MONTHS, THAT THIS, AS THEY UNDER-
STOOD, WAS GOING TO TAKE SOME TIME.  WE HAVE GOT TWO SETS OF NEW
LEADERS AND I THINK AS LONG AS WE REMAIN COMMITTED TO THE ULTIMATE
NORMALISATION OF RELATIONSHIPS AS HANDLED IN THAT SHANGHAI AGREE-
MENT, I THINK WE ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO MOVE FORWARD PROGRESSIVELY.
SENATOR YOUNG ANSWER:  WE HAVE ALWAYS TAKEN PRIDE AS A NATION IN
KEEPING OUR TREATIES AND OBLIGATIONS WITH OTHER COUNTRIES.  THIS

CANNOT ALLOW US TO ABROGATE A TREATY AGREEMENT WITH TAIWAN.  I THINK
PATIENCE AND TIME WILL RESOLVE THIS PROBLEM BUT ALONG WITH THE
KOREAN PROBLEM, WE HAVE SOME OBLIGATIONS THERE TOO - OF WE WERE TO
ABROGATE THEM, THERE MIGHT BE ANOTHER WAR THERE TOO - IT WOULD UPSET
THE WHOLE BALANCE OF POWER IN THE MIDDLE EAST.  SHOULD WE DO ALL
THIS, WE'D PROBABLY SAY GO A STEP FURTHER AND LET JAPAN RE-ARM AND I
CAN'T THINK.... WE HAVE A NEW ADMINISTRATION, A LOT OF DIFFERENCE OF
OPINION IN CONGRESS, BUT ONE THING WE DO AGREE UPON IS THAT OF
KEEPING OUR COMMITMENTS TO OTHER COUNTRIES.
SENATOR STEVENS ANSWER:  I THINK SENATOR JOHNSTON USED THE
WORD &quot;SECONDARY&quot;, AND I REALLY THINK THEY REALLY SET SOME MINOR
ISSUE BENNETT AS FAR AS TAIWAN IS CONCERNED AND THAT THE MAJOR ISSUE
AS FAR AS THE P.R.C. IS CONCERNED IS IN FACT THE RUSSIAN INFLUENCE
BUT THEY WERE VERY STRONG ON THIS CONCEPT OF PULLING OUR TROOPS OUT
OF KOREA AND ALLOWING THE KOREAN PROBLEM TO BE SETTLED INTERNALLY -
AS THEY SAY, THE TAIWAN PROBLEM IS AN INTERNAL CHINA PROBLEM AND AS
I RECALL MISS WONG WAS VERY SPECIFIC IN SAYING SHE DID NOT BELIEVE
THAT ANY INTERFERENCE FROM ANY SOURCE OUTSIDE OF CHINA WOULD BE
TOLERATED.  IT SEEMS TO ME THAT WE OUGHT TO TRY AND CONVEY THE
IMPRESSION THAT WE GOT FROM THEM AND THAT WE GAVE TO THEM.  MY
FEELING IS THAT WE GAVE TO THEM THE IMPRESSION THAT WE WERE DEFIN-
ITELY, AS A COUNTRY, DESIROUS OF CONTINUING THE PROCESS TOWARDS
NORMALISATION BUT THAT THE TIME FRAME WOULD NOT BE A CHINESE TIME
FRAME AS FAR AS THE UNITED STATES WAS CONCERNED.  THEY GAVE US THE
IMPRESSION THAT WHILE THEY WANTED NORMALISATION, THEY WANTED THE
UNITED STATES TO REMAIN STRONG MILITARILY TO BE A BALANCE AGAINST
RUSSIA MORE THAN THEY WANTED US TO SOLVE THE TAIWAN PROBLEM IMMED-
IATELY.  THAT'S MY IMPRESSION.
SENATOR HOLLINGS ANSWER:  YOU ARE RIGHT TO REPORT ON THIS.  THERE
ARE MANY ANOMALIES - AND IF YOU TALK ABOUT TROOPS, TO HAVE THOSE OF
KOREA WHICH THEY ASKED FOR - AT THE VERY SAME TIME THEY ASKED US
POSITIVELY FOR OUR TROOPS TO SAY IN EUROPE.  IN FACT I WILL NEVER
FORGET PREMIER LEE'S STATEMENT TO THE EFFECT THAT, A QUESTION WAS
ASKED BY THE CHAIRMAN OF OUR TROOPS IN EUROPE, HE SAID WE NOT ONLY
WANT YOU TO STAY IN EUROPE, WE WANT EUROPE TO STAY IN EUROPE, SO
THERE YOU ARE.  THESE THINGS HAVE GOT TO BE SORTED OUT AND TAKEN
INTO CONSIDERATION WITH OTHER STATEMENTS MADE.
QUESTION:  YOU JUST REFERRED TO MR. LEE AS PREMIER LEE, DID YOU GET
THE IMPRESSION THAT HE WAS ACTING AS PREMIER?
SENATOR HOLLINGS ANSWER:  NO, NO, WE COULDN'T GIVE ANY TIP.  WE
DON'T KNOW ANY MORE THAN YOU DO ON THAT SCORE, CHAIRMAN HUA OR

ANYTHING ELSE - WE WERE TOLD THAT THEY RESTED ON EVERY LITTLE WORD
WE SAID BUT THE TRUTH OF THE MATTER IS PERHAPS WE RESTED ON EVERY
LITTLE WORD TOO MUCH THEY SAID.  THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS THAT THIS
CENTRAL COMMITTEE IS GOING TO RUN, THE COUNTRY IS GOING TO RUN, IT'S
GOING TO BE RUN IN THE MEMORY OF CHAIRMAN MAO FOR YEARS TO COME,
REGARDLESS OF WHO IS THE PREMIER, AND I THINK IF AN AUTOMOBILE RAN
OVER ONE LEADER TODAY, THEY'D HAVE ANOTHER ONE FROM THE CENTRAL
COMMITTEE THE NEXT DAY, AND IF THAT HAPPENED YOU'D HAVE ANOTHER ONE
THE THIRD DAY - I'M TRYING TO TALK IN TERMS OF SENSE IN THE CONTEXT
THAT A COMMITTEE, A CENTRAL COMMITTEE, RUNS THAT COUNTRY AND IT'S
CONTINUITY AND IT'S ALL IN THE MEMORY OF CHAIRMAN MAO.
SENATOR BAYH ANSWER:  I WOULD THINK THAT WE GOT THE DISTINCT
IMPRESSION ALTHOUGH THEY WERE TRYING TO MOVE FORWARD AND EMPHASISE
HUA, THAT THERE WAS A GREATER RELIANCE THAN WE HAD BEEN TOLD BEFORE
ON THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE - THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE UNDER THE LEADER-
SHIP OF CHAIRMAN HUA - AND THAT WHAT WAS JUST SAID ABOUT THE FACT
THAT WHOEVER THE TOP PERSON IS, IT IS NOT AS IMPORTANT AS THE
FACT THAT THEY ARE GOING TO CONTINUE THE GENERAL POLICY, WHICH I
FRANKLY FEEL IS GOING TO BE A MORE MODERATE POLICY NOW THAN WOULD
HAVE BEEN SO IF IT HAD GONE THE OTHER WAY IN THAT DISAGREEMENT THEY
HAD WITH THE SHANGHAI....
SENATOR CURTIS ANSWER:  I LEFT CHINA WITH THE DISTINCT IMPRESSION
THAT THE CHINESE PRIMARY CONCERN WAS A FEAR OF THE SOVIET AND THAT
THEY WILL CONTINUE COOPERATION WITH THE UNITED STATES IN ALL THINGS
THAT PROTECT THEM FROM ANY ADVERSE ACTION ON THE PART OF THE SOVIET
AND THEY STATED MORE THAN ONCE THAT THAT WAS THE PRIMARY ISSUE.  I
DO NOT BELIEVE IT WOULD BE APPROPRIATE FOR US TO ABANDON TAIWAN, TO
ABROGATE A TREATY.  I BELIEVE THOSE THINGS CAN BE WORKED OUT, I DO
NOT THINK THAT OUR FUTURE COOPERATION DEPENDS UPON IMMEDIATE ABRUPT
ACTION.
QUESTION:  DID THEY SAY WHAT THEY THOUGHT MIGHT HAPPEN IF THE U.S.
PULLED OUT OF KOREA MILITARILY?
SENATOR CURTIS ANSWER:  NOT THAT I RECALL.
SENATOR STEVENS ANSWER:  THEY SAID THEY THOUGHT THAT THE INTERNAL
QUESTION WOULD BE SOLVED BY KOREA, AND THAT WAS IN ANSWER TO YOUR
QUESTION BENNETT.
SENATOR JOHNSTON ANSWER:  REALLY THE QUESTION OF TAIWAN AND THE
QUESTION OF KOREA WAS NOT BROUGHT UP BY ANY OF OUR CHINESE HOSTS BUT
BY US.  THE QUESTION OF KOREA, AND A QUESTION BY ME TO THE EFFECT
THAT WOULD IT INTERFERE WITH PROGRESS IN THE SHANGHAI COMMUNIQUE AND
PROGRESS TOWARD NORMALISATION BETWEEN OUR TWO COUNTRIES IF WE
UNCLASSIFIED

UNCLASSIFIED

PAGE 04        HONG K 14021  02 OF 04  021443Z

REMAINED IN KOREA, AND THE VICE FOREIGN MINISTER PROCEEDED TO GIVE
THE STANDARD LINE ON KOREA.  NOW, YOU CAN READ THAT EITHER WAY - YOU
COULD EITHER READ THAT AS BEING THAT IF WOULD NOT INTERFERE WITH THE
NORMALISATION OF RELATIONS, WHICH IS FRANKLY THE WAY I READ IT, OR
YOU COULD READ IT AS A CALL TO REMOVE OUR TROOPS.  I THINK THAT IF
WAS THE FORMER.  AND ON THE QUESTION OF TAIWAN, THEY DID NOT BRING
UP THE QUESTION OF TAIWAN - WE DID - AND AFTER SOME DISCUSSION, AS
SENATOR STEPHENS SAID, THEY SAID IT WAS SECONDARY AND MINOR BUT
WORDS TO THE SAME EFFECT.  ONE KEY THAT I KEPT LOOKING FOR HINTS AND
EVIDENCE OF, IS THE QUESTION OF WHETHER HUA HAS CONSOLIDATED HIS
POWER OR NOT, WHETHER HE IS IN FACT THE LEGITIMATE CHAIRMAN.  YOU
ALWAYS LOOK FOR LITTLE HINTS AND LITTLE BITS AND PIECES.  I THOUGHT
WE COULD BEGIN TO SEE THOSE BITS AND PIECES - FOR EXAMPLE, SOME OF
THE WALL POSTERS WERE BEGINNING TO SAY CHAIRMAN HUA AND THE CENTRAL
COMMITTEE RATHER THAN THE WAY THEY HAD BEEN A FEW WEEKS AGO SAYING
CENTRAL COMMITTEE UNDER THE LEADERSHIP OF HUA - A SUBTLE DIFFERENCE
BUT SOME OF THE WALL POSTERS WERE BEGINNING TO SAY THAT.  I SAW
SOME PHOTOGRAPHS IN DUNGWANG (? SP.) FINALLY A PHOTOGRAPH OF
CHAIRMAN HUA IN ONE OF THE DISPLAY CASES AT COUNTY FAIR YOU MIGHT
CALL IT.  IN OTHER WORDS IT SEEMS TO ME THAT HE IS BEGINNING TO BE
LEGITIMISED AS THE CHAIRMAN AND AS THE REAL LEADER OF CHINA.
SENATOR BAYH ANSWER:  LET ME JUST POINT OUT ONE INCONSISTENCY THERE
THAT WHEN THEY ANSWERED SENATOR JOHNSTON'S QUESTION ON KOREA, THEY
DID GIVE A TRADITIONAL RESPONSE WHICH IS SOMETHING TO THE EFFECT
THAT THIS IS A KOREAN MATTER AND SHOULD BE SOLVED INTERNALLY BY THE
KOREANS IN A PEACEFUL MANNER AND THE INTERNAL DIFFERENCES BETWEEN
CHINA ON THE MAINLAND AND CHINA IN TAIWAN, OF COURSE THEY HAD NOT
GONE SO FAR AS TO SAY THAT THIS IS AN INTERNAL MATTER AND SHOULD BE
SOLVED IN A PEACEFUL MANNER.  IF THEY DID THAT, WE WOULD HAVE A LOT
LESS PROBLEMS IN RESOLVING THAT PROBLEM.

E.O. 11652: N/A

SUBJECT: CODEL CURTIS PRESS CONFERENCE

REF: STATE 289148

QUESTION:  SENATOR CURTIS, WERE YOU GIVEN ANY INFORMATION ON THE
EARTHQUAKE WHILE YOU WERE IN CHINA?
SENATOR CURTIS ANSWER:  I RECEIVED SOME VIBRATIONS IN MY BED, I
OBSERVED THE CANDELIER SWINGING BACK AND FORTH, BUT AFTER IT WAS
ALL OVER, AFTER THE NEXT TWO OR THREE DAYS, I ASKED OUR GUIDES AND
INTERPRETERS ABOUT THE EARTHQUAKE - HAS IT AFFECTED OTHER CITIES
AND THEY SAID HAD,N'T HEARD YET.
SENATOR STEVENS ANSWER:  THE ANSWER IS WE NEVER WERE GIVEN ANY
COMPLETE INFORMATION ABOUT THAT SECOND SHOCK, AS TO HOW IT AFFECTED
THE REST OF CHINA.  WE WERE IN IT IN PEKING AND IT WAS A RELATIVELY
MILD AFTER SHOCK REALLY.
SENATOR HOLLINGS ANSWER:  WE WERE TOLD IT WAS ABOUT 6.9 ON THE RICHTER

SCALE.
SENATOR JOHNSTON ANSWER:  MR. FAN, ONE OF OUR HOSTS, SAID THAT THEY
HAD HAD SOME NOTICE OF IT AND THAT THEY WERE ABLE TO GET MOST OF THE
POEPLE OUT IN TUNGSHAN, I THINK WAS THE NAME OF IT, AND SO THEY
DIDN'T THINK THE DAMAGES WERE TOO GREAT.  NOW THAT WAS JUST ONE OF
THE INTERPRETERS ACCOMPANYING US.
SENATOR STEVENS ANSWER:  THE STARTLING THING ABOUT PEKING THOUGH -
UNCLASSIFIED

UNCLASSIFIED

PAGE 02        HONG K 14021  03 OF 04  030501Z

I DON'T KNOW IF YOU HAVE EVEN HEARD IT - BUT THE LAST NIGHT WE WERE
THERE, WE DROVE BY THE RED SQUARE AND IT WAS, YOU KNOW, NORMAL.
THE NEXT MORNING, BY EIGHT O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING WE DROVE BY, THE
WHOLE THING WAS COMPLETELY SURROUNDED BY A FENCE, EVERY PIECE OF
MARBLE HAD BEEN MOVED, ALL OF THE TREES HAD BEEN CATEGORIED AND
EITHER MOVED OR SET ASIDE, AND THE MONUMENT FOR MAO WAS UNDER WAY.
IT TOOK US ABOUT SIX OR SEVEN HOURS TO LEARN WHAT IT WAS ALL ABOUT -
WE ALL SUSPECTED WHAT IT WAS - BUT I HAVE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING MOVE
SO FAST IN MY LIFE.  THAT RED SQUARE WAS UNDERLINED BY TUNNELS AND
DITCHES AND ALL OF THE CONCRETE AND MARBLE WAS MOVED WITHIN A SPACE
OF SIXTEEN HOURS.  I DON'T KNOW HOW LONG IT WILL BE BEFORE YOU SEE
THAT MONUMENT BUT IT'S CERTAINLY UNDER WAY, THERE'S NO TWO WAYS
ABOUT IT.
SENATOR JOHNSTON ANSWER:  SPEAKING OF TUNNELS, ONE OF THE MORE
INTERESTING THINGS I THINK WE SAW WAS THE WEB OF TUNNELS UNDER THE
CITY OF PEKING.  AIR RAID SHELTERS - THE FIRST LEVEL IS ABOUT 25
FEET UNDER THE SURFACE, THEY ARE NOW WORKING ON THE SECOND LEVEL
ABOUT 50 FEET UNDER THE SURFACE, THEY GO FAR ENOUGH IN ONE DIRECTION
THAT I THINK IT TAKES YOU ABOUT THREE HOURS TO WALK FROM ONE END TO
THE OTHER, JUST TO WALK, BUT THEY ARE LARGE ENOUGH THEY SAY TO
ACCOMMODATE FOUR MILLION PEOPLE.
SENATOR STEVENS ANSWER:  IT'S THE NEW GREAT WALL - IT'S THE
UNDERGROUND GREAT WALL OF CHINA THAT IS BEING BUILT AND IT'S MAO'S
INSTRUCTIONS TO DIG TUNNELS DEEP AND THEY'RE CERTAINLY DOING IT.
SENATOR JOHNSTON ANSWER:  THEY HAVE AIR PURIFIERS AND WATER SYSTEMS
AND TOILETS AND MESS HALLS AND THE WHOLE SYSTEM.
QUESTION:  THIS STATEMENT OF WONG TAI RUN'S, IF I HEARD YOU RIGHT,
SHE SAID THAT CHINA WOULD NOT AGREE TO A PEACEFUL SOLUTION OF THE
TAIWAN PROBLEM.
SENATOR JOHNSTON ANSWER:  THAT'S RIGHT.
QUESTION: WHAT IMPRESSION DID YOU GET SHE MEANT BY THAT?
SENATOR JOHNSTON ANSWER:  MY IMPRESSION WAS THAT THEY WOULD AGREE TO
NO CONDITIONS ALLT ALL, THAT TAIWAN IS A CHINESE PROBLEM THAT WOULD
BE SETTLED BY THE CHINESE AND THAT THEY WOULD TAKE NO CONDITIONS
WHATSOEVER ON THE REUNIFICATION.
QUESTION:  NOW DO YOU TAKE THAT TO MEAN THAT IT WOULD CLOSE THE DOOR
ON FOR INSTANCE OUR SUPPLYING MILITARY SPARE PARTS TO THE TAIWANESE
AFTER NORMALISATION?
SENATOR JOHNSTON ANSWER:  WELL THAT'S THEIR LINE AT THIS TIME BUT
AGAIN THEY ARE NOT PUSHING THAT LINE.  THEY DIDN'T BRING UP THE
QUESTION OF TAIWAN BUT WHEN THE QUESTION OF TAIWAN WAS BROUGHT UP,
UNCLASSIFIED

UNCLASSIFIED

PAGE 03        HONG K 14021  03 OF 04  030501Z

THEY SAID IT WAS AN INTERNAL CHINESE PROBLEM, YOU MUST RECOGNISE
THAT THAT'S OUR PROBLEM AND WE WILL NOT ASSENT TO ANY CONDITIONS ON
YOUR RECOGNITION.
SENATOR YOUNG ANSWER:  IT ALL SEEMED TO ADD TO ONE THING THOUGH,
THAT THERE WOULD BE NO NORMAL RELATIONS WITH THE UNITED STATES UNTIL
THAT TAIWAN THING WAS SETTLED.
QUESTION:  THEY DIDN'T RULE OUT A PEACEFUL .....(LAST PART OF
QUESTION INAUDIBLE)
SENATOR CURTIS ANSWER:  IF I MAY SAY IN SUMMARY FOR MYSELF THEY
REPEATED THEIR TRADITIONAL LINE ON ALL THESE QUESTIONS BUT I DO NOT
BELIEVE THAT THE UNITED STATES MUST SURRENDER TO THE CHINESE VIEW-
POINT ON EVERY ISSUE IN ORDER FOR THE COOPERATION TO CONTINUE.  THEY
WANT AND NEED THE FRIENDSHIP AND THE COOPERATION OF THE UNITED
STATES BECAUSE OF THEIR FEAR OF RUSSIA.
SENATOR STEVENS ANSWER:  IT'S PRETTY SURE THOUGH THAT THEY SAID THAT
THEY DID NOT BELIEVE IN PEACEFUL TRANSITION, THERE WAS THE TRAN-
SITION QUESTION, AND THAT THE METHODS AND MEANS AND WHEN THEY WOULD
BE USED TO LIBERATE TAIWAN WOULD BE AN INTERNAL MATTER AND THAT NO
OTHER NATION WOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO INTERFERE WHATSOEVER.
SENATOR HOLLINGS ANSWER:  YOU CAN'T TREAT WHAT THEY SAY LIGHTLY BUT
YOU CAN'T TREAT WHAT THEY SAY CATEGORICALLY.  FOR THIRTY YEARS WE'VE
BEEN CAPTIONED AS DOGS ON THOSE POSTERS BUT EVERYBODY WAVED AND
SMILED EVERYWHERE WE WENT.
QUESTION:  DID THEY MAKE ANY EFFORT TO ASK THE DEMOCRATS AMONGST
YOU WHAT MR. CARTER HAD SAID HIS VIEWS ON CHINA MIGHT BE IF HE WERE
ELECTED TO COPE WITH THIS PROBLEM?  (THE LAST PART OF THIS QUESTION
WAS SOMEWHAT INAUDIBLE.)
SENATOR JOHNSTON ANSWER:  YES, I THINK AT LEAST PRIVATELY.  WE HAD
THESE GUIDES THAT WOULD GO WITH US - MOST WERE WITH THE INSTITUTE
OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS, SOME WERE WITH THE FOREIGN MINISTRY - AND WE
WOULD CHANGE GUIDES FROM TIME TO TIME WHEN WE RODE IN CARS AND THEY,
AT LEAST TWO OF THEM ASKED ME THAT QUESTION.  I DIDN'T GIVE THEM A
DEFINITIVE ANSWER.
QUESTION:  DID THEY SEEM TO KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT PRESIDENT-ELECT
CARTER'S VIEWS?
SENATOR JOHNSTON ANSWER:  NOT A GREAT DEAL, NOT MUCH MORE THAN WE DO.
SENATOR BAYH ANSWER:  THEY SERVED US A LOT OF PEANUTS ALONG THE WAY.
SENATOR STEVENS ANSWER:  THEY CALL THEM GROUNDNUTS THOUGH.
SENATOR JOHNSTON ANSWER:  ONE THING THAT STRUCK ME, AS A MATTER OF
SORT OF LOCAL COLOUR, WAS THE INCREDIBLE PROPAGANDISATION OF THE
EPOPLE.  IN SHANGHAI FOR EXAMPLE, NOT ONLY DID YOU HAVE THIS

REPLICATION OF WALL POSTERS, THE RADIO PLAYED NOTHING BUT REVOL-
UTIONARY SONGS, I MEAN NOTHING BUT REVOLUTIONARY SONGS, THEY HAD
LOUDSPEAKEERRS OUT IN THE FIELD WHERE THE WORKERS WERE WORKING THAT
EXHORTED YOU KNOW ALL THE COMMUNIST SLOGANS, ALL THE REVOLUTIONS;
OF COURSE THE NEWSPAPERS, INSOFAR AS WE COULD SEE THEM, WERE
NOTHING BUT REVOLUTION.  THEY HAD SORT OF REVELLIE LOUDSPEAKERS THAT
WENT OFF ABOUT SIX O'CLOCK THAT STARTED OFF WITH A REVOLUTIONARY
SONG, SORT OF A REVOLUTIONARY REVELLIE - THE MOST INCREDIBLE JUST
CONSTANCY.  IN SHANGHAI WHERE WE SAW THE LITTLE PLAY BY THE LITTLE
KIDS, WHO WERE VERY CUTE YOU KNOW, BUT ONE OF THE THINGS THEY DID IS
THEY HAD THIS LITTLE BLACKBOARD SET UP OUTSIDE WITH A PICTURE OF
THE GANG OF FOUR DRAWN IN CHALK AND THE LITTLE KIDS WERE GIVEN
BEANBAGS AND TOLD TO GO THROW IT AT THE BLACKBOARD.

REF: STATE 289148

SENATOR STEVENS ANSWER:  I DON'T THINK THE VERDICT IS IN IN SHANGHAI
YET - I SAID THIS TO FRITZ (?) LAST NIGHT.  AT EIGHT O'CLOCK AT NIGHT
WHEN IT WAS DARK, WITH THESE WALL NEWSPAPERS - THEY WERE IN SERIES
ALL ALONG THE WALL - THERE WERE PEOPLE LINED UP FOUR AND FIVE DEEP
WAITING TO GET A CHANCE TO READ WHAT WAS ON THAT WALL, MILLIONS AND
MILLIONS OF PEOPLE OUT LOOKING AT THESE POSTERS AND READING WHAT'S
IN THESE WALL NEWSPAPERS, AND WE GOT THE FEELING, AT LEAST I GOT THE
THE FEELING, THAT THE PROPAGANDA OFFENSIVE IN SHANGHAI IS INCREASING
IN INTENSITY , THAT THAT IS PROBABLY THE WHOLE CENTRE OF THE PRO-
PAGANDA OFFENSIVE AS FAR AS THE GANG OF FOUR IS CONCERNED.
SENATOR BAYH ANSWER:  AND IT'S GOING BEYOND THE ORIGINAL FOUR BUT
IT'S ALSO TAKING ON TWO OR THREE OTHER SIGNIFICANT SHANGHAI REGIONAL
LEADERS.
QUESTION:  DO YOU KNOW THEIR NAMES?
SENATOR BAYH ANSWER:  NO, I'M SORRY, I HAD IT PUT IN MY NOTES BUT I
DON'T REMEMBER THEIR NAMES.
QUESTION:  DID LEE TSIEN YEN OFFER ANY KIND OF AN IMPRESSION OF
JIMMY CARTER?
SENATOR BAYH ANSWER:  NO.
QUESTION:  DID THEY GIVE YOU THE IMPRESSION THAT THEY THOUGHT THAT
THE FACT THAT PRESIDENT FORD WAS NOT ELECTED WOULD DELAY MATTERS
SOMEWHAT IN THE PROCEDURES TOWARD NORMALISATION?

PAGE 02        HONG K 14021  04 OF 04  021631Z

SENATOR HOLLINGS ANSWER:  NOT NECESSARILY.
SENATOR CURTIS ANSWER:  THEY DID NOT DISCUSS THAT IN ANY DETAIL AT
ALL (THE LAST PART OF THIS ANSWER IS INAUDIBLE.)
SENATOR STEVENS ANSWER:  THE ONLY QUESTION I HAD ALONG THAT LINE
WAS WHETHER I BELIEVED THE NATIONAL DEFENCE POLICY WOULD CHANGE AS
FAR AS IT CONCERNED RUSSIA AND THIS PART OF THE WORLD AND MY COMMENT
WAS I DIDN'T BELIEVE IT WOULD, I DIDN'T BELIEVE THAT WE WOULD SEE
ANY DRASTIC CHANGE IN AMERICAN POLICY OVER HERE.
SENATOR CURTIS ANSWER:  THEY WERE INTERESTED IN THE UNITED STATES
CONTINUING TO BE STRONG MILITARILY.  I BELIEVE THAT FRIENDSHIP AND
COOPERATION CAN CONTINUE AND THE UNITED STATES STILL HAVE SOMETHING
TO SAY ABOUT THE TERMS THAT WE GET TOGETHER ON.  I DO NOT THINK THAT
THE URGENCY OF ANY OF THEIR PROBLEMS ARE SUCH THAT WE HAVE TO YIELD
TOTALLY TO THEIR VIEWPOINT ON ANY ISSUE.
SENATOR BAYH ANSWER:  IT MIGHT BE INTERESTING TO KNOW - IT WAS TO ME
- AND OF COURSE AS A COUPLE OF YOU SAID, WE TENDED TO TRY TO LOOK
FOR EACH WORD AND EACH INFLECTION, AND I'M SURE THEY DID TOO, BUT
COMPARED TO WHAT WE'D BEEN TOLD BY SENATOR SCOTT AND SOME OF THE
OTHER OFFICIALS IN THE GOVERNMENT WHO HAVE BEEN THERE, ALTHOUGH WE
GOT THE PARTY LINE AND WE GOT TO DIG TUNNELS DEEP AND STORE RICE
EVERYWHERE AND BE SELF-RELIANT AND THE WHOLE BIT, BUT WE DIDN'T GET
THAT AT EVERY STOP WITH THE KIND OF INTENSITY WE'D BEEN LED TO
BELIEVE WE MIGHT GET IT AND THE OFFICIALS WHO TALKED TO US PRESENTED
THEIR POSITION IN A MUCH MORE MODERATE TONE OF VOICE AND A MUCH LESS
ARGUMENTATIVE TENOR THAN AT LEAST I'D BEEN LED TO BELIEVE WE COULD
EXPECT.  NOW HERE AGAIN I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD MAKE TOO MUCH OUT
OF THAT BUT I THINK THAT'S PROBABLY A FAIR ASSESSMENT.
SENATOR STEVENS ANSWER:  CARL I KNOW YOU WANT TO END THIS BUT I
WANT TO SAY, I SERVED IN CHINA DURING WORLD WAR II WITH THE FOUR-
TEENTH AIR FORCE AND I'VE SEEN GREAT CHANGE IN CHINA.  THE RICKSHOWS
ARE GONE, THE PROSTITUTES ARE GONE, THE STREET PEDDLERS ARE
GONE, THERE IS AN APPARENT CHANGE IN AGRICULTURE, THERE IS AN
INCREASE IN INDUSTRIALISATION AND I THINK EVERYWHERE WE WENT WE SAW
THE EFFECTS OF INCREASED MODERNISATION OF FARM MACHINERY AND THE
GROWTH OF A LABOUR FORCE IN SMALL INDUSTRY AND VILLAGES THROUGHOUT
THE COUNTRY - THE CHANGES THAT ARE COMING ABOUT IN CHINA, IN MY
OPINION, MAKE CHINA A MUCH STRONGER NATION THAN I THOUGHT I'D SEE
AND I DON'T THINK YOU CAN WALK THROUGH ONE OF THOSE SMALL VILLAGE
INDUSTRIES LIKE THE GENERATOR PLANT WE SAW IN DANGWANG (?) WITHOUT
REALISING HOW INNOVATIVE THESE PEOPLE ARE TO MAKE WITH VERY FEW RAW
MATERIALS SOME VERY EXCELLENT GENERATORS AND TRANSFORMERS AND MOTORS
UNCLASSIFIED

UNCLASSIFIED

PAGE 03        HONG K 14021  04 OF 04  021631Z

FROM SCRATCH.  NOW THE CONSTANT CHANGE IN AGRICULTURE IS PROVIDING
THEM MORE PEOPLE FOR LIGHT INDUSTRY AND THE LIGHT INDUSTRY IS
MAKING MORE AND MORE MACHINE TOOLS AND MORE AND MORE MACHINE TOOLS
ARE GIVING WAY TO LARGER AND LARGER SMALL PLANTS TO MAKE THINGS LIKE
THE GENERATORS WE SAW, BUT I THINK THAT THIS IS A PERIOD OF
INCREASING CHANGE IN CHINA.  IN MY OPINION, WE CANNOT GO BACK AND
TELL THE PEOPLE IN THE UNITED STATES THAT CHINA IS NOT COMPLETELY ON
THE ROCKS - IT IS ON THE ROCKS.
SENATOR JOHNSTON ANSWER:  MY ADVICE TO RUSSIA WOULD BE, TO COIN A
PHRASE, DON'T GET INVOLVED IN A WAR ON THE MAINLAND OF CHINA BECAUSE
THOSE PEOPLE ARE VERY TOUGH AND THERE ARE LOTS OF THEM AND THEY'RE
DUG IN AND THEY'RE INCREDIBLY LIBERATED IN THEIR INDUSTRY, AS
SENATOR STEPHENS SAID, WE SAW A FACTORY IN DANGWANG, WHICH IS A SMALL
COUNTRY SEAT, THAT DOES EVERYTHING FROM CASTING THE STEEL FRAMES FOR
THE GENERATORS TO MAKING THE BALL BEARINGS FOR THEM.
SENATOR STEVENS ANSWER:  AND THEY'RE PEOPLE OF ONE MIND.  I TELL YOU
I DIDN'T SEE ANY DEVIATION  FROM THE PARTY LINE OR FROM ONE MIND.
IT'S BASICALLY WHAT...A UNISEXUAL SOCIETY THAT HAS ONE PURPOSE AND
THAT IS TO STAY BEHIND THAT CENTRAL COMMITTEE.  THE CENTRAL
COMMITTEE IS COMPLETELY IN CHARGE AS FAR AS I AM CONCERNED - IT IS
THE LEADERSHIP OF THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE HEADED BY CHAIRMAN HUA IN MY
OPINION AND THAT IS A DISTINCTION.  I DON'T THINK IT'S A MEANINGLESS
DISTINCTION LIKE MY FRIEND DOES - I THINK IT IS A DISTINCTION BUT
THAT HE'S CORRECT THAT ANY LEADER THAT HAS THAT CENTRAL COMMITTEE
AND THE ARMY BEHIND HIM IS GOING TO LEAD CHINA WITHOUT ANY PROBLEM.
SENATOR YOUNG ANSWER:  IF I COULD ADD JUST ONE WORD - I DON'T THINK
THAT (TWO WORDS OBLITERATED BY SOMEONE COUGHING) ENVIRONMENT (?)
IS THE ONLY NEW MODERN WEAPON THAT THEY ARE MAKING.  THEY ARE MOVING
AHEAD MILITARILY - HERE IS A VERY INTELLIGENT PEOPLE, THE WOMEN ALL
WORK AND SACRIFICE AND THEY COULD BECOME A REAL TOUGH POWER.
SENATOR STEVENS ANSWER:  YES, THAT SUBTERRANEAN SYSTEM OF BOMB SHELTE
RS
WE WERE TOLD WAS CONSTRUCTED BY PEOPLE IN THEIR SPARE TIME,
COMPLETELY WITHOUT COST TO THE STATE EXCEPT FOR THE MATERIALS.
EVERYBODY HAS DONATED THEIR TIME AND YOU SHOULD SEE IT - IT'S A
FANTASTIC NETWORK OF UNDERGROUND AIR RAID SHELTERS.

SENATOR CURTIS  WE THANK YOU FOR COMING AND IF ANY OF YOU WANT TO
DIRECT ENQUIRIES AT SOME OF THE INDIVIDUAL MEMBERS, I'M SURE
THEY WILL DO THEIR BEST TO COOPERATE.

FOLLOWING IS A TRANSCRIPT OF CODEL CURTIS' NOVEMBER 22 PRESS
CONFERENCE IN HONG KONG AS REQUESTED REFTEL.
SENATOR CURTIS
I WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE GENTLEMEN OF THE PRESS FOR BEING HERE.
WE ARE TRAVELLING ON A PRESIDENTIAL MISSION; WE WERE APPOINTED BY
PRESIDENT FORD.  I WOULD LIKE TO INTRODUCE MY COLLEAGUES - ON MY
RIGHT IS THE VICE CHAIRMAN OF THE DELEGATION, SENATOR BAYH OF
INDIANA, NEXT TO HIM IS SENATOR HOLLINGS OF SOUTH CAROLINA, SENATOR
JOHNSTON OF LOUISIANA, SENATOR MILTON YOUNG OF NORTH DAKOTA AND
SENATOR STEPHENS OF ALASKA.  I HAVE A BRIEF STATEMENT:  EVERYONE
WILL SPEAK FOR THEMSELVES IN THIS PRESS CONFERENCE BUT WE HAVE MADE
NO RECORDERS OF THE COMMITTEE.  WE HAVE MET WITH VICE PREMIER LEE
AND WITH THE VICE MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS, MISS WONG.  WE SPENT
TWO WEEKS IN CHINA; WE WERE AT SHANGHAI, NANKING, PEKING, ....(IN-
AUDIBLE) PLUS VISITING OF COMMUNES AND THE COUNTRYSIDE.  THE
PEOPLE ARE WARM AND FRIENDLY; THE CHINESE PEOPLE WHOM WE SAW
APPEARED HAPPY, HEALTHY AND WELL FED.  THEIR SYSTEM OF AGRICULTURE
SERVES A DUAL PURPOSE - THEY ARE NEAR SELF SUFFICIENT IN FOOD AND
IT PROVIDES EMPLOYMENT FOR THEIR PEOPLE.  WE VISITED SEVERAL
FACTORIES AND FOUND A CONSIDERABLE DEGREE OF SOPHISTICATION IN
THEIR OPERATION.  IT APPEARS CLEAR THAT THE CHANGE IN CHINA'S
LEADERSHIP CAUSED BY THE DEATH OF MAO TSE TUNG AND THE ADVANCE OF

PAGE 02        HONG K 14021  01 OF 04  021406Z

CHAIRMAN HUA HAS NOT CHANGED THEHDIRECTION OF CHINA TOWARD THE
UNITED STATES.  COOPERATION WITH THE UNITED STATES UNDER CHAIRMAN
HUA WILL CONTINUE.  THE CHINESE LEADERS REPEATEDLY VOICED THEIR
DISTRUST OF THE SOVIETS; IN THEIR BELIEF IT IS THE SOVIET'S DESIRE
TO EXPAND THEIR TERRITORY.  THE CHINESE EXPRESSED A DESIRE FOR PEACE
AND STATED THAT THEY DID NOT WISH TO EXTEND THEIR OWN TARRITORY AND
IF THE SOVIETS SHOULD ATTACK THEM, THAT THE SOVIETS WOULD SUFFER
DEFEAT.  THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA'S POSITION ON TAIWAN HAS
NOT CHANGED AND WAS FREQUENTLY MENTIONED BUT THEY STATED THAT THE
WORLD AFFAIRS, THAT IS THE THREAT OF VOVIET EXPANSION IN ASIA,
EUROPE AND ELSEWHERE WAS THE ISSUE OF FIRST IMPORTANCE.  THERE WERE
DISCUSSIONS ON TRADE AND A CONTINUATION OF EXCHANGE OF BUSINESS.
THE GREATEST POSSIBILITY FOR U.S. EXPORTS TO CHINA PERHAPS ARE
PLANTS AND MACHINES BUT WE CONVEYED TO THEM THE DESIRE TO SELL THEM
GRAIN, THAT WHICH THEY'D NEED TO IMPORT.  WE ALSO EXPRESSED AN
INTEREST IN THEIR OIL DEVELOPMENT AND SUGGESTED AN EXCHANGE OF
GRAIN FOR OIL OR OTHER AMERICAN PRODUCTS.
QUESTION:  SIR, COULD YOU TELL US SPECIFICALLY WHAT METHODS YOU ARE
TAKING BACK TO THE WHITE HOUSE REGARDING SINO-AMERICAN RELATIONS
AND SPECIFICALLY THE RECOGNITION ISSUE?
SENATOR CURTIS ANSWER:  I DIDN'T HEAR THE LAST PART.
QUESTION:  COULD YOU TELL US WHAT METHODS YOU ARE TAKING BACK TO THE
WHITE HOUSE REGARDING THE RECOGNITION ISSUE?
SENATOR CURTIS ANSWER:  WE WILL GIVE THEM A REPORT SOMEWHAT AS I
STATED HERE, WE WILL ACT INDIVIDUALLY ON THAT.  WE INFORMED, I
INFORMED THE CHINESE OF MY POSITION THAT THE QUESTION OF TAIWAN
WAS A PROBLEM FOR US AND WE HOPED THAT IT COULD BE WORKED OUT
PEACEABLY.
QUESTION:  SENATOR MANSFIELD THIS MORNING, ACCORDING TO REPORTS,N
APPEARS TO FEEL THAT IT IS A MATTER THAT WANTS TO BE SORTED OUT
FAIRLY URGENTLY.  DO ANY OF YOU FEEL THE SAME WAY?
SENATOR CURTIS ANSWER:  I DO NOT AGREE WITH THE MANSFIELD
STATEMENT.  HIS LONG TIME OBJECTIVE IS ANOTHER MATTER.  THE ABRO-
GATION OF A TREATY IS A SERIOUS ACTION AND I AM NOT PREPARED TO DO
MY PART IN COMMITTING OUR GOVERNMENT TO SUCH A COURSE AT THIS TIME.
QUESTION:  DO ANY OF THE OTHER SENATORS HERE FEEL THAT THEY ARE?
SENATOR BAYH ANSWER:  LET ME JUST, IF I MIGHT JUST SAY, I THINK
SENATOR KERR'S OPENING STATEMENT PRETTY WELL HIT ALL THE HIGH
POINTS.  I THINK I CAN SAY FOR ALL OF US THAT WHEN YOU GO THROUGH
AN EXPERIENCE LIKE THIS, AND WHEN YOU COME OUT YOU REALISE THE
BASIC DIFFERENCES THAT DISTINGUISH A CLOSED SOCIETY FROM A FREE

SOCIETY AND YOU THANK GOD ONCE AGAIN FOR LIVING IN A FREE SOCIETY.
THOSE OF US WHO COME TO TAKE FOR GRANTED SOME OF THE BASIC FREEDOMS
THAT WE HAVE NEVERTHELESS I THINK HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THAT PEOPLE
WHO LIVE IN THE COUNTRY HAVE NEVER UNDERSTOOD OR KNOWN THOSE
FREEDOMS, DON'T PLACE THE KIND OF VALUE ON THEM THAT WE DO.  I
THINK THE NEW ADMINISTRATION SHOULD REMAIN COMMITTED TO THE
FULFILMENT OF THE SHARING HIGH ACCORD.  I FRANKLY BELIEVE - AND I
HAVE THE GREATEST RESPECT FOR SENATOR MANSFIELD, AND THIS STATEMENT
OF HIS IS NOT A NEW STATEMENT, HE HAS THOUGHT THIS WAY A LONG WHILE
- I FRANKLY BELIEVE THAT WITH NEW LEADERSHIP IN CHINA AND NEW
LEADERSHIP IN THE UNITED STATES, THAT PRECIPITOUS ACTION RIGHT NOW
IS UNREALISTIC AND WE ARE GOING TO GO THROUGH A PERIOD WHERE BOTH
SETS OF NEW LEADERS GET MORE FAMILIAR WITH ONE ANOTHER AND I HOPE
THAT BOTH UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE OF LONG TIME NORMALISATION IN
RELATIONSHIPS.  I SENSED, AS I THINK SENATOR CURTIS MENTIONED THAT
ALL OF US, THAT EVERYBODY SHOULD SPEAK FOR THEMSELVES, THAT I THINK
THERE IS A VERY STRONG FEELING AMONG THE OFFICIALS THAT WE SPOKE
WITH FOR A NORMALISATION OF RELATIONSHIPS.  WE TOLD THEM THAT WE
WANT NORMAL RELATIONSHIPS BUT THE PROBLEMS ARE AS GREAT NOW AS THEY
WERE BEFORE THE CHANGE OF LEADERS, AND I THINK IT IS GOING TO BE A
STEP BY STEP RETURN TO
NORMALISATION INSTEAD OF AWAKENING AND
HAVING A PROCLAMATION ON THE PRESIDENT'S DESK, AS SAID TO ME.
SENATOR HOLLINGS ANSWER:  I THINK THE SAME THING - I THINK THE STEP
BY STEP PROCEDURE AND ONE OF CAUTION AND BEING DELIBERATE AND
CAREFUL AND CONSIDERATE IN OUR CONDUCT IS THE HIGHLIGHT OF HOW IT
IS TO BE DONE RATHER THAN URGENCY.  THE FACT OF THE MATTEJ IS THAT
IN THE DISCUSSIONS WE HAD WITH MR. LEE, I POINTED OUT TO HIM MYSELF
THAT WE WEREN'T GOING TO ABANDON OUR FRIENDS IN TAIWAN; WE RECOGNISE
THAT THE SHANGHAI COMMUNIQUE HAS STATED ONE CHINA BUT THE MATTER OF
NORMALISATION COULD ONLY COME ABOUT AS TENSIONS EASE AND I THOUGHT
IT WAS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF BOTH SIDES TO CREATE AN EASING OF TGOSE
TENSIONS - I DON'T THINK IT'S A SINGULAR AMERICAN PROBLEM, I THINK
IT'S A CHINESE PROBLEM AS WELL - AND THEY ARE GOING TO HAVE TO
MAKE A LITTLE PROGRESS OFTHEIR OWN AMONGST PEOPLE AND GIVE A FEELING
OF SECURITY AND PROTECTION OF COURSE TO OUR FRIENDS THERE BECAUSE
WE ARE JUST NOT GOING TO UP AND ABANDON TAIWAN, AND I THINK THAT'SD
CLEAR IN MY MIND AND I DON'T THINK THE NATIONAL CONGRESS OF PRESIDENT
CARTER HAS ANY IDEA OF ANY URGENCY TO MOVE IN WITH A TOTAL CUT OFF
OF OUR SECURITY TREATY.  I HAVEN'T SEEN THE MANSFIELD STATEMENT BUT
I WILL SAY THAT WE HAVE GOT TO GIVE CONSTANT CARE TO WHAT'S BEEN

ACCOMPLISHED OVER THE SHANGHAI COMMUNIQUE - WE CAN'T UST LET IT
LANGUISH - WE HAVE GOT TO GICE THE PROPER RECOGNITION AND ATTENTION
TO MAINLAND CHINA BUT THE URGENCY THAT SENATOR MANSFIELD TALKS OF,
I WOULD DISAGREE WITH.
QUESTION:  SENATOR, WHAT DID VICE PREMIER LEE SAY TO YOU WHEN HE
TOLD YOU THIS?
SENATOR HOLLINGS ANSWER:  WELL, HE TOLD ME THAT I WAS RIGHT WHEN I
SAID THERE WAS ONE CHINA BUT HE SAID ON THE MATTER OF, I WAS TRYING
TO EMPHASISE THE STEP BY STEP, NAMELY THAT THEY SHOULD SEND SIMILAR
DELEGATIONS AS OURS TO THE UNITED STATES, THAT WE SORT OF STEP UP
TRADE, HE SAID WELL WE COULDN'T SEND DELEGATIONS AS LONG AS THE
EMBASSY OF TAIWAN WAS THERE IN WASHINGTON, D.C., HE SAID IT WOULD BE
AN EMBARRASSMENT TO CHINA AND TO US.

E.O. 11652: N/A
TAGS: SOPN, US, CH
SUBJECT: CODEL CURTIS PRESS CONFERENCE

REF: STATE 289148

SENATOR JOHNSTON ANSWER:  THEY SAID TWO THINGS I THINK THAT WERE
IMPORTANT ON THE TAIWAN ISSUE.  FIRST IN OUR MEETING WITH THE VICE
FOREIGN MINISTER, SHE SAID, IN DISCUSSING THE TAIWAN ISSUE, THAT
CHINA WOULD NOT AGREE TO A PEACEFUL SETTLEMENT OF THE TAIWAN ISSUE
AND SECONDLY, THE VICE PREMIER LEE STATED, AFTER A DISCUSSION FOR
SOME PERIOD OF TIME ON THE TAIWAN ISSUE, THAT TAIWAN WAS SECONDARY
AND RELATIONSHIPS WITH RESPECT TO RUSSIA WERE PRIMARY, SO THAT WHILE
THEY ARE COMMITTED TO REUNIFICATION AND ABSORPTION OF TAIWAN AND
WHILE THEY ARE NOT WILLING TO SAY THAT THEY WILL DO IT BY PEACEFUL
MEANS, NEVERTHELESS WHEN IT COMES RIGHT DOWN TO IT, THAT'S A
SECONDARY ISSUE WITH THEM AT THE PRESENT TIME AND RELATIONSHIPS AND
THEIR GLOBAL SECURITY ARE PRIMARY.
SENATOR BAYH ANSWER:  I DID NOT GET THE FEELING - EXCUSE ME, PARDON
ME FOR INTERRUPTING - I DID NOT GET THE FEELING THAT ANY OF THE
LEADERS THAT WE DISCUSSED THIS PROBLEM WITH EXPECTED THIS MATTER TO
BE RESOLVED IN A MATTER OF WEEKS OR MONTHS, THAT THIS, AS THEY UNDER-
STOOD, WAS GOING TO TAKE SOME TIME.  WE HAVE GOT TWO SETS OF NEW
LEADERS AND I THINK AS LONG AS WE REMAIN COMMITTED TO THE ULTIMATE
NORMALISATION OF RELATIONSHIPS AS HANDLED IN THAT SHANGHAI AGREE-
MENT, I THINK WE ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO MOVE FORWARD PROGRESSIVELY.
SENATOR YOUNG ANSWER:  WE HAVE ALWAYS TAKEN PRIDE AS A NATION IN
KEEPING OUR TREATIES AND OBLIGATIONS WITH OTHER COUNTRIES.  THIS
UNCLASSIFIED

UNCLASSIFIED

PAGE 02        HONG K 14021  02 OF 04  021443Z

CANNOT ALLOW US TO ABROGATE A TREATY AGREEMENT WITH TAIWAN.  I THINK
PATIENCE AND TIME WILL RESOLVE THIS PROBLEM BUT ALONG WITH THE
KOREAN PROBLEM, WE HAVE SOME OBLIGATIONS THERE TOO - OF WE WERE TO
ABROGATE THEM, THERE MIGHT BE ANOTHER WAR THERE TOO - IT WOULD UPSET
THE WHOLE BALANCE OF POWER IN THE MIDDLE EAST.  SHOULD WE DO ALL
THIS, WE'D PROBABLY SAY GO A STEP FURTHER AND LET JAPAN RE-ARM AND I
CAN'T THINK.... WE HAVE A NEW ADMINISTRATION, A LOT OF DIFFERENCE OF
OPINION IN CONGRESS, BUT ONE THING WE DO AGREE UPON IS THAT OF
KEEPING OUR COMMITMENTS TO OTHER COUNTRIES.
SENATOR STEVENS ANSWER:  I THINK SENATOR JOHNSTON USED THE
WORD &quot;SECONDARY&quot;, AND I REALLY THINK THEY REALLY SET SOME MINOR
ISSUE BENNETT AS FAR AS TAIWAN IS CONCERNED AND THAT THE MAJOR ISSUE
AS FAR AS THE P.R.C. IS CONCERNED IS IN FACT THE RUSSIAN INFLUENCE
BUT THEY WERE VERY STRONG ON THIS CONCEPT OF PULLING OUR TROOPS OUT
OF KOREA AND ALLOWING THE KOREAN PROBLEM TO BE SETTLED INTERNALLY -
AS THEY SAY, THE TAIWAN PROBLEM IS AN INTERNAL CHINA PROBLEM AND AS
I RECALL MISS WONG WAS VERY SPECIFIC IN SAYING SHE DID NOT BELIEVE
THAT ANY INTERFERENCE FROM ANY SOURCE OUTSIDE OF CHINA WOULD BE
TOLERATED.  IT SEEMS TO ME THAT WE OUGHT TO TRY AND CONVEY THE
IMPRESSION THAT WE GOT FROM THEM AND THAT WE GAVE TO THEM.  MY
FEELING IS THAT WE GAVE TO THEM THE IMPRESSION THAT WE WERE DEFIN-
ITELY, AS A COUNTRY, DESIROUS OF CONTINUING THE PROCESS TOWARDS
NORMALISATION BUT THAT THE TIME FRAME WOULD NOT BE A CHINESE TIME
FRAME AS FAR AS THE UNITED STATES WAS CONCERNED.  THEY GAVE US THE
IMPRESSION THAT WHILE THEY WANTED NORMALISATION, THEY WANTED THE
UNITED STATES TO REMAIN STRONG MILITARILY TO BE A BALANCE AGAINST
RUSSIA MORE THAN THEY WANTED US TO SOLVE THE TAIWAN PROBLEM IMMED-
IATELY.  THAT'S MY IMPRESSION.
SENATOR HOLLINGS ANSWER:  YOU ARE RIGHT TO REPORT ON THIS.  THERE
ARE MANY ANOMALIES - AND IF YOU TALK ABOUT TROOPS, TO HAVE THOSE OF
KOREA WHICH THEY ASKED FOR - AT THE VERY SAME TIME THEY ASKED US
POSITIVELY FOR OUR TROOPS TO SAY IN EUROPE.  IN FACT I WILL NEVER
FORGET PREMIER LEE'S STATEMENT TO THE EFFECT THAT, A QUESTION WAS
ASKED BY THE CHAIRMAN OF OUR TROOPS IN EUROPE, HE SAID WE NOT ONLY
WANT YOU TO STAY IN EUROPE, WE WANT EUROPE TO STAY IN EUROPE, SO
THERE YOU ARE.  THESE THINGS HAVE GOT TO BE SORTED OUT AND TAKEN
INTO CONSIDERATION WITH OTHER STATEMENTS MADE.
QUESTION:  YOU JUST REFERRED TO MR. LEE AS PREMIER LEE, DID YOU GET
THE IMPRESSION THAT HE WAS ACTING AS PREMIER?
SENATOR HOLLINGS ANSWER:  NO, NO, WE COULDN'T GIVE ANY TIP.  WE
DON'T KNOW ANY MORE THAN YOU DO ON THAT SCORE, CHAIRMAN HUA OR
UNCLASSIFIED

PAGE 03        HONG K 14021  02 OF 04  021443Z

ANYTHING ELSE - WE WERE TOLD THAT THEY RESTED ON EVERY LITTLE WORD
WE SAID BUT THE TRUTH OF THE MATTER IS PERHAPS WE RESTED ON EVERY
LITTLE WORD TOO MUCH THEY SAID.  THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS THAT THIS
CENTRAL COMMITTEE IS GOING TO RUN, THE COUNTRY IS GOING TO RUN, IT'S
GOING TO BE RUN IN THE MEMORY OF CHAIRMAN MAO FOR YEARS TO COME,
REGARDLESS OF WHO IS THE PREMIER, AND I THINK IF AN AUTOMOBILE RAN
OVER ONE LEADER TODAY, THEY'D HAVE ANOTHER ONE FROM THE CENTRAL
COMMITTEE THE NEXT DAY, AND IF THAT HAPPENED YOU'D HAVE ANOTHER ONE
THE THIRD DAY - I'M TRYING TO TALK IN TERMS OF SENSE IN THE CONTEXT
THAT A COMMITTEE, A CENTRAL COMMITTEE, RUNS THAT COUNTRY AND IT'S
CONTINUITY AND IT'S ALL IN THE MEMORY OF CHAIRMAN MAO.
SENATOR BAYH ANSWER:  I WOULD THINK THAT WE GOT THE DISTINCT
IMPRESSION ALTHOUGH THEY WERE TRYING TO MOVE FORWARD AND EMPHASISE
HUA, THAT THERE WAS A GREATER RELIANCE THAN WE HAD BEEN TOLD BEFORE
ON THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE - THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE UNDER THE LEADER-
SHIP OF CHAIRMAN HUA - AND THAT WHAT WAS JUST SAID ABOUT THE FACT
THAT WHOEVER THE TOP PERSON IS, IT IS NOT AS IMPORTANT AS THE
FACT THAT THEY ARE GOING TO CONTINUE THE GENERAL POLICY, WHICH I
FRANKLY FEEL IS GOING TO BE A MORE MODERATE POLICY NOW THAN WOULD
HAVE BEEN SO IF IT HAD GONE THE OTHER WAY IN THAT DISAGREEMENT THEY
HAD WITH THE SHANGHAI....
SENATOR CURTIS ANSWER:  I LEFT CHINA WITH THE DISTINCT IMPRESSION
THAT THE CHINESE PRIMARY CONCERN WAS A FEAR OF THE SOVIET AND THAT
THEY WILL CONTINUE COOPERATION WITH THE UNITED STATES IN ALL THINGS
THAT PROTECT THEM FROM ANY ADVERSE ACTION ON THE PART OF THE SOVIET
AND THEY STATED MORE THAN ONCE THAT THAT WAS THE PRIMARY ISSUE.  I
DO NOT BELIEVE IT WOULD BE APPROPRIATE FOR US TO ABANDON TAIWAN, TO
ABROGATE A TREATY.  I BELIEVE THOSE THINGS CAN BE WORKED OUT, I DO
NOT THINK THAT OUR FUTURE COOPERATION DEPENDS UPON IMMEDIATE ABRUPT
ACTION.
QUESTION:  DID THEY SAY WHAT THEY THOUGHT MIGHT HAPPEN IF THE U.S.
PULLED OUT OF KOREA MILITARILY?
SENATOR CURTIS ANSWER:  NOT THAT I RECALL.
SENATOR STEVENS ANSWER:  THEY SAID THEY THOUGHT THAT THE INTERNAL
QUESTION WOULD BE SOLVED BY KOREA, AND THAT WAS IN ANSWER TO YOUR
QUESTION BENNETT.
SENATOR JOHNSTON ANSWER:  REALLY THE QUESTION OF TAIWAN AND THE
QUESTION OF KOREA WAS NOT BROUGHT UP BY ANY OF OUR CHINESE HOSTS BUT
BY US.  THE QUESTION OF KOREA, AND A QUESTION BY ME TO THE EFFECT
THAT WOULD IT INTERFERE WITH PROGRESS IN THE SHANGHAI COMMUNIQUE AND
PROGRESS TOWARD NORMALISATION BETWEEN OUR TWO COUNTRIES IF WE
UNCLASSIFIED

UNCLASSIFIED

PAGE 04        HONG K 14021  02 OF 04  021443Z

REMAINED IN KOREA, AND THE VICE FOREIGN MINISTER PROCEEDED TO GIVE
THE STANDARD LINE ON KOREA.  NOW, YOU CAN READ THAT EITHER WAY - YOU
COULD EITHER READ THAT AS BEING THAT IF WOULD NOT INTERFERE WITH THE
NORMALISATION OF RELATIONS, WHICH IS FRANKLY THE WAY I READ IT, OR
YOU COULD READ IT AS A CALL TO REMOVE OUR TROOPS.  I THINK THAT IF
WAS THE FORMER.  AND ON THE QUESTION OF TAIWAN, THEY DID NOT BRING
UP THE QUESTION OF TAIWAN - WE DID - AND AFTER SOME DISCUSSION, AS
SENATOR STEPHENS SAID, THEY SAID IT WAS SECONDARY AND MINOR BUT
WORDS TO THE SAME EFFECT.  ONE KEY THAT I KEPT LOOKING FOR HINTS AND
EVIDENCE OF, IS THE QUESTION OF WHETHER HUA HAS CONSOLIDATED HIS
POWER OR NOT, WHETHER HE IS IN FACT THE LEGITIMATE CHAIRMAN.  YOU
ALWAYS LOOK FOR LITTLE HINTS AND LITTLE BITS AND PIECES.  I THOUGHT
WE COULD BEGIN TO SEE THOSE BITS AND PIECES - FOR EXAMPLE, SOME OF
THE WALL POSTERS WERE BEGINNING TO SAY CHAIRMAN HUA AND THE CENTRAL
COMMITTEE RATHER THAN THE WAY THEY HAD BEEN A FEW WEEKS AGO SAYING
CENTRAL COMMITTEE UNDER THE LEADERSHIP OF HUA - A SUBTLE DIFFERENCE
BUT SOME OF THE WALL POSTERS WERE BEGINNING TO SAY THAT.  I SAW
SOME PHOTOGRAPHS IN DUNGWANG (? SP.) FINALLY A PHOTOGRAPH OF
CHAIRMAN HUA IN ONE OF THE DISPLAY CASES AT COUNTY FAIR YOU MIGHT
CALL IT.  IN OTHER WORDS IT SEEMS TO ME THAT HE IS BEGINNING TO BE
LEGITIMISED AS THE CHAIRMAN AND AS THE REAL LEADER OF CHINA.
SENATOR BAYH ANSWER:  LET ME JUST POINT OUT ONE INCONSISTENCY THERE
THAT WHEN THEY ANSWERED SENATOR JOHNSTON'S QUESTION ON KOREA, THEY
DID GIVE A TRADITIONAL RESPONSE WHICH IS SOMETHING TO THE EFFECT
THAT THIS IS A KOREAN MATTER AND SHOULD BE SOLVED INTERNALLY BY THE
KOREANS IN A PEACEFUL MANNER AND THE INTERNAL DIFFERENCES BETWEEN
CHINA ON THE MAINLAND AND CHINA IN TAIWAN, OF COURSE THEY HAD NOT
GONE SO FAR AS TO SAY THAT THIS IS AN INTERNAL MATTER AND SHOULD BE
SOLVED IN A PEACEFUL MANNER.  IF THEY DID THAT, WE WOULD HAVE A LOT
LESS PROBLEMS IN RESOLVING THAT PROBLEM.

FOR EA/PRCM FROM ANDERSON

E.O. 11652: N/A
TAGS: SOPN, US, CH
SUBJECT: CODEL CURTIS PRESS CONFERENCE

REF: STATE 289148

QUESTION:  SENATOR CURTIS, WERE YOU GIVEN ANY INFORMATION ON THE
EARTHQUAKE WHILE YOU WERE IN CHINA?
SENATOR CURTIS ANSWER:  I RECEIVED SOME VIBRATIONS IN MY BED, I
OBSERVED THE CANDELIER SWINGING BACK AND FORTH, BUT AFTER IT WAS
ALL OVER, AFTER THE NEXT TWO OR THREE DAYS, I ASKED OUR GUIDES AND
INTERPRETERS ABOUT THE EARTHQUAKE - HAS IT AFFECTED OTHER CITIES
AND THEY SAID HAD,N'T HEARD YET.
SENATOR STEVENS ANSWER:  THE ANSWER IS WE NEVER WERE GIVEN ANY
COMPLETE INFORMATION ABOUT THAT SECOND SHOCK, AS TO HOW IT AFFECTED
THE REST OF CHINA.  WE WERE IN IT IN PEKING AND IT WAS A RELATIVELY
MILD AFTER SHOCK REALLY.
SENATOR HOLLINGS ANSWER:  WE WERE TOLD IT WAS ABOUT 6.9 ON THE RICHTER

SCALE.
SENATOR JOHNSTON ANSWER:  MR. FAN, ONE OF OUR HOSTS, SAID THAT THEY
HAD HAD SOME NOTICE OF IT AND THAT THEY WERE ABLE TO GET MOST OF THE
POEPLE OUT IN TUNGSHAN, I THINK WAS THE NAME OF IT, AND SO THEY
DIDN'T THINK THE DAMAGES WERE TOO GREAT.  NOW THAT WAS JUST ONE OF
THE INTERPRETERS ACCOMPANYING US.
SENATOR STEVENS ANSWER:  THE STARTLING THING ABOUT PEKING THOUGH -
UNCLASSIFIED

UNCLASSIFIED

PAGE 02        HONG K 14021  03 OF 04  030501Z

I DON'T KNOW IF YOU HAVE EVEN HEARD IT - BUT THE LAST NIGHT WE WERE
THERE, WE DROVE BY THE RED SQUARE AND IT WAS, YOU KNOW, NORMAL.
THE NEXT MORNING, BY EIGHT O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING WE DROVE BY, THE
WHOLE THING WAS COMPLETELY SURROUNDED BY A FENCE, EVERY PIECE OF
MARBLE HAD BEEN MOVED, ALL OF THE TREES HAD BEEN CATEGORIED AND
EITHER MOVED OR SET ASIDE, AND THE MONUMENT FOR MAO WAS UNDER WAY.
IT TOOK US ABOUT SIX OR SEVEN HOURS TO LEARN WHAT IT WAS ALL ABOUT -
WE ALL SUSPECTED WHAT IT WAS - BUT I HAVE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING MOVE
SO FAST IN MY LIFE.  THAT RED SQUARE WAS UNDERLINED BY TUNNELS AND
DITCHES AND ALL OF THE CONCRETE AND MARBLE WAS MOVED WITHIN A SPACE
OF SIXTEEN HOURS.  I DON'T KNOW HOW LONG IT WILL BE BEFORE YOU SEE
THAT MONUMENT BUT IT'S CERTAINLY UNDER WAY, THERE'S NO TWO WAYS
ABOUT IT.
SENATOR JOHNSTON ANSWER:  SPEAKING OF TUNNELS, ONE OF THE MORE
INTERESTING THINGS I THINK WE SAW WAS THE WEB OF TUNNELS UNDER THE
CITY OF PEKING.  AIR RAID SHELTERS - THE FIRST LEVEL IS ABOUT 25
FEET UNDER THE SURFACE, THEY ARE NOW WORKING ON THE SECOND LEVEL
ABOUT 50 FEET UNDER THE SURFACE, THEY GO FAR ENOUGH IN ONE DIRECTION
THAT I THINK IT TAKES YOU ABOUT THREE HOURS TO WALK FROM ONE END TO
THE OTHER, JUST TO WALK, BUT THEY ARE LARGE ENOUGH THEY SAY TO
ACCOMMODATE FOUR MILLION PEOPLE.
SENATOR STEVENS ANSWER:  IT'S THE NEW GREAT WALL - IT'S THE
UNDERGROUND GREAT WALL OF CHINA THAT IS BEING BUILT AND IT'S MAO'S
INSTRUCTIONS TO DIG TUNNELS DEEP AND THEY'RE CERTAINLY DOING IT.
SENATOR JOHNSTON ANSWER:  THEY HAVE AIR PURIFIERS AND WATER SYSTEMS
AND TOILETS AND MESS HALLS AND THE WHOLE SYSTEM.
QUESTION:  THIS STATEMENT OF WONG TAI RUN'S, IF I HEARD YOU RIGHT,
SHE SAID THAT CHINA WOULD NOT AGREE TO A PEACEFUL SOLUTION OF THE
TAIWAN PROBLEM.
SENATOR JOHNSTON ANSWER:  THAT'S RIGHT.
QUESTION: WHAT IMPRESSION DID YOU GET SHE MEANT BY THAT?
SENATOR JOHNSTON ANSWER:  MY IMPRESSION WAS THAT THEY WOULD AGREE TO
NO CONDITIONS ALLT ALL, THAT TAIWAN IS A CHINESE PROBLEM THAT WOULD
BE SETTLED BY THE CHINESE AND THAT THEY WOULD TAKE NO CONDITIONS
WHATSOEVER ON THE REUNIFICATION.
QUESTION:  NOW DO YOU TAKE THAT TO MEAN THAT IT WOULD CLOSE THE DOOR
ON FOR INSTANCE OUR SUPPLYING MILITARY SPARE PARTS TO THE TAIWANESE
AFTER NORMALISATION?
SENATOR JOHNSTON ANSWER:  WELL THAT'S THEIR LINE AT THIS TIME BUT
AGAIN THEY ARE NOT PUSHING THAT LINE.  THEY DIDN'T BRING UP THE
QUESTION OF TAIWAN BUT WHEN THE QUESTION OF TAIWAN WAS BROUGHT UP,
UNCLASSIFIED

UNCLASSIFIED

PAGE 03        HONG K 14021  03 OF 04  030501Z

THEY SAID IT WAS AN INTERNAL CHINESE PROBLEM, YOU MUST RECOGNISE
THAT THAT'S OUR PROBLEM AND WE WILL NOT ASSENT TO ANY CONDITIONS ON
YOUR RECOGNITION.
SENATOR YOUNG ANSWER:  IT ALL SEEMED TO ADD TO ONE THING THOUGH,
THAT THERE WOULD BE NO NORMAL RELATIONS WITH THE UNITED STATES UNTIL
THAT TAIWAN THING WAS SETTLED.
QUESTION:  THEY DIDN'T RULE OUT A PEACEFUL .....(LAST PART OF
QUESTION INAUDIBLE)
SENATOR CURTIS ANSWER:  IF I MAY SAY IN SUMMARY FOR MYSELF THEY
REPEATED THEIR TRADITIONAL LINE ON ALL THESE QUESTIONS BUT I DO NOT
BELIEVE THAT THE UNITED STATES MUST SURRENDER TO THE CHINESE VIEW-
POINT ON EVERY ISSUE IN ORDER FOR THE COOPERATION TO CONTINUE.  THEY
WANT AND NEED THE FRIENDSHIP AND THE COOPERATION OF THE UNITED
STATES BECAUSE OF THEIR FEAR OF RUSSIA.
SENATOR STEVENS ANSWER:  IT'S PRETTY SURE THOUGH THAT THEY SAID THAT
THEY DID NOT BELIEVE IN PEACEFUL TRANSITION, THERE WAS THE TRAN-
SITION QUESTION, AND THAT THE METHODS AND MEANS AND WHEN THEY WOULD
BE USED TO LIBERATE TAIWAN WOULD BE AN INTERNAL MATTER AND THAT NO
OTHER NATION WOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO INTERFERE WHATSOEVER.
SENATOR HOLLINGS ANSWER:  YOU CAN'T TREAT WHAT THEY SAY LIGHTLY BUT
YOU CAN'T TREAT WHAT THEY SAY CATEGORICALLY.  FOR THIRTY YEARS WE'VE
BEEN CAPTIONED AS DOGS ON THOSE POSTERS BUT EVERYBODY WAVED AND
SMILED EVERYWHERE WE WENT.
QUESTION:  DID THEY MAKE ANY EFFORT TO ASK THE DEMOCRATS AMONGST
YOU WHAT MR. CARTER HAD SAID HIS VIEWS ON CHINA MIGHT BE IF HE WERE
ELECTED TO COPE WITH THIS PROBLEM?  (THE LAST PART OF THIS QUESTION
WAS SOMEWHAT INAUDIBLE.)
SENATOR JOHNSTON ANSWER:  YES, I THINK AT LEAST PRIVATELY.  WE HAD
THESE GUIDES THAT WOULD GO WITH US - MOST WERE WITH THE INSTITUTE
OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS, SOME WERE WITH THE FOREIGN MINISTRY - AND WE
WOULD CHANGE GUIDES FROM TIME TO TIME WHEN WE RODE IN CARS AND THEY,
AT LEAST TWO OF THEM ASKED ME THAT QUESTION.  I DIDN'T GIVE THEM A
DEFINITIVE ANSWER.
QUESTION:  DID THEY SEEM TO KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT PRESIDENT-ELECT
CARTER'S VIEWS?
SENATOR JOHNSTON ANSWER:  NOT A GREAT DEAL, NOT MUCH MORE THAN WE DO.
SENATOR BAYH ANSWER:  THEY SERVED US A LOT OF PEANUTS ALONG THE WAY.
SENATOR STEVENS ANSWER:  THEY CALL THEM GROUNDNUTS THOUGH.
SENATOR JOHNSTON ANSWER:  ONE THING THAT STRUCK ME, AS A MATTER OF
SORT OF LOCAL COLOUR, WAS THE INCREDIBLE PROPAGANDISATION OF THE
EPOPLE.  IN SHANGHAI FOR EXAMPLE, NOT ONLY DID YOU HAVE THIS

REPLICATION OF WALL POSTERS, THE RADIO PLAYED NOTHING BUT REVOL-
UTIONARY SONGS, I MEAN NOTHING BUT REVOLUTIONARY SONGS, THEY HAD
LOUDSPEAKEERRS OUT IN THE FIELD WHERE THE WORKERS WERE WORKING THAT
EXHORTED YOU KNOW ALL THE COMMUNIST SLOGANS, ALL THE REVOLUTIONS;
OF COURSE THE NEWSPAPERS, INSOFAR AS WE COULD SEE THEM, WERE
NOTHING BUT REVOLUTION.  THEY HAD SORT OF REVELLIE LOUDSPEAKERS THAT
WENT OFF ABOUT SIX O'CLOCK THAT STARTED OFF WITH A REVOLUTIONARY
SONG, SORT OF A REVOLUTIONARY REVELLIE - THE MOST INCREDIBLE JUST
CONSTANCY.  IN SHANGHAI WHERE WE SAW THE LITTLE PLAY BY THE LITTLE
KIDS, WHO WERE VERY CUTE YOU KNOW, BUT ONE OF THE THINGS THEY DID IS
THEY HAD THIS LITTLE BLACKBOARD SET UP OUTSIDE WITH A PICTURE OF
THE GANG OF FOUR DRAWN IN CHALK AND THE LITTLE KIDS WERE GIVEN
BEANBAGS AND TOLD TO GO THROW IT AT THE BLACKBOARD.

E.O. 11652: N/A
TAGS: SOPN, US, CH
SUBJECT: CODEL CURTIS PRESS CONFERENCE

REF: STATE 289148

SENATOR STEVENS ANSWER:  I DON'T THINK THE VERDICT IS IN IN SHANGHAI
YET - I SAID THIS TO FRITZ (?) LAST NIGHT.  AT EIGHT O'CLOCK AT NIGHT
WHEN IT WAS DARK, WITH THESE WALL NEWSPAPERS - THEY WERE IN SERIES
ALL ALONG THE WALL - THERE WERE PEOPLE LINED UP FOUR AND FIVE DEEP
WAITING TO GET A CHANCE TO READ WHAT WAS ON THAT WALL, MILLIONS AND
MILLIONS OF PEOPLE OUT LOOKING AT THESE POSTERS AND READING WHAT'S
IN THESE WALL NEWSPAPERS, AND WE GOT THE FEELING, AT LEAST I GOT THE
THE FEELING, THAT THE PROPAGANDA OFFENSIVE IN SHANGHAI IS INCREASING
IN INTENSITY , THAT THAT IS PROBABLY THE WHOLE CENTRE OF THE PRO-
PAGANDA OFFENSIVE AS FAR AS THE GANG OF FOUR IS CONCERNED.
SENATOR BAYH ANSWER:  AND IT'S GOING BEYOND THE ORIGINAL FOUR BUT
IT'S ALSO TAKING ON TWO OR THREE OTHER SIGNIFICANT SHANGHAI REGIONAL
LEADERS.
QUESTION:  DO YOU KNOW THEIR NAMES?
SENATOR BAYH ANSWER:  NO, I'M SORRY, I HAD IT PUT IN MY NOTES BUT I
DON'T REMEMBER THEIR NAMES.
QUESTION:  DID LEE TSIEN YEN OFFER ANY KIND OF AN IMPRESSION OF
JIMMY CARTER?
SENATOR BAYH ANSWER:  NO.
QUESTION:  DID THEY GIVE YOU THE IMPRESSION THAT THEY THOUGHT THAT
THE FACT THAT PRESIDENT FORD WAS NOT ELECTED WOULD DELAY MATTERS
SOMEWHAT IN THE PROCEDURES TOWARD NORMALISATION?

PAGE 02        HONG K 14021  04 OF 04  021631Z

SENATOR HOLLINGS ANSWER:  NOT NECESSARILY.
SENATOR CURTIS ANSWER:  THEY DID NOT DISCUSS THAT IN ANY DETAIL AT
ALL (THE LAST PART OF THIS ANSWER IS INAUDIBLE.)
SENATOR STEVENS ANSWER:  THE ONLY QUESTION I HAD ALONG THAT LINE
WAS WHETHER I BELIEVED THE NATIONAL DEFENCE POLICY WOULD CHANGE AS
FAR AS IT CONCERNED RUSSIA AND THIS PART OF THE WORLD AND MY COMMENT
WAS I DIDN'T BELIEVE IT WOULD, I DIDN'T BELIEVE THAT WE WOULD SEE
ANY DRASTIC CHANGE IN AMERICAN POLICY OVER HERE.
SENATOR CURTIS ANSWER:  THEY WERE INTERESTED IN THE UNITED STATES
CONTINUING TO BE STRONG MILITARILY.  I BELIEVE THAT FRIENDSHIP AND
COOPERATION CAN CONTINUE AND THE UNITED STATES STILL HAVE SOMETHING
TO SAY ABOUT THE TERMS THAT WE GET TOGETHER ON.  I DO NOT THINK THAT
THE URGENCY OF ANY OF THEIR PROBLEMS ARE SUCH THAT WE HAVE TO YIELD
TOTALLY TO THEIR VIEWPOINT ON ANY ISSUE.
SENATOR BAYH ANSWER:  IT MIGHT BE INTERESTING TO KNOW - IT WAS TO ME
- AND OF COURSE AS A COUPLE OF YOU SAID, WE TENDED TO TRY TO LOOK
FOR EACH WORD AND EACH INFLECTION, AND I'M SURE THEY DID TOO, BUT
COMPARED TO WHAT WE'D BEEN TOLD BY SENATOR SCOTT AND SOME OF THE
OTHER OFFICIALS IN THE GOVERNMENT WHO HAVE BEEN THERE, ALTHOUGH WE
GOT THE PARTY LINE AND WE GOT TO DIG TUNNELS DEEP AND STORE RICE
EVERYWHERE AND BE SELF-RELIANT AND THE WHOLE BIT, BUT WE DIDN'T GET
THAT AT EVERY STOP WITH THE KIND OF INTENSITY WE'D BEEN LED TO
BELIEVE WE MIGHT GET IT AND THE OFFICIALS WHO TALKED TO US PRESENTED
THEIR POSITION IN A MUCH MORE MODERATE TONE OF VOICE AND A MUCH LESS
ARGUMENTATIVE TENOR THAN AT LEAST I'D BEEN LED TO BELIEVE WE COULD
EXPECT.  NOW HERE AGAIN I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD MAKE TOO MUCH OUT
OF THAT BUT I THINK THAT'S PROBABLY A FAIR ASSESSMENT.
SENATOR STEVENS ANSWER:  CARL I KNOW YOU WANT TO END THIS BUT I
WANT TO SAY, I SERVED IN CHINA DURING WORLD WAR II WITH THE FOUR-
TEENTH AIR FORCE AND I'VE SEEN GREAT CHANGE IN CHINA.  THE RICKSHOWS
ARE GONE, THE PROSTITUTES ARE GONE, THE STREET PEDDLERS ARE
GONE, THERE IS AN APPARENT CHANGE IN AGRICULTURE, THERE IS AN
INCREASE IN INDUSTRIALISATION AND I THINK EVERYWHERE WE WENT WE SAW
THE EFFECTS OF INCREASED MODERNISATION OF FARM MACHINERY AND THE
GROWTH OF A LABOUR FORCE IN SMALL INDUSTRY AND VILLAGES THROUGHOUT
THE COUNTRY - THE CHANGES THAT ARE COMING ABOUT IN CHINA, IN MY
OPINION, MAKE CHINA A MUCH STRONGER NATION THAN I THOUGHT I'D SEE
AND I DON'T THINK YOU CAN WALK THROUGH ONE OF THOSE SMALL VILLAGE
INDUSTRIES LIKE THE GENERATOR PLANT WE SAW IN DANGWANG (?) WITHOUT
REALISING HOW INNOVATIVE THESE PEOPLE ARE TO MAKE WITH VERY FEW RAW
MATERIALS SOME VERY EXCELLENT GENERATORS AND TRANSFORMERS AND MOTORS
UNCLASSIFIED

UNCLASSIFIED

PAGE 03        HONG K 14021  04 OF 04  021631Z

FROM SCRATCH.  NOW THE CONSTANT CHANGE IN AGRICULTURE IS PROVIDING
THEM MORE PEOPLE FOR LIGHT INDUSTRY AND THE LIGHT INDUSTRY IS
MAKING MORE AND MORE MACHINE TOOLS AND MORE AND MORE MACHINE TOOLS
ARE GIVING WAY TO LARGER AND LARGER SMALL PLANTS TO MAKE THINGS LIKE
THE GENERATORS WE SAW, BUT I THINK THAT THIS IS A PERIOD OF
INCREASING CHANGE IN CHINA.  IN MY OPINION, WE CANNOT GO BACK AND
TELL THE PEOPLE IN THE UNITED STATES THAT CHINA IS NOT COMPLETELY ON
THE ROCKS - IT IS ON THE ROCKS.
SENATOR JOHNSTON ANSWER:  MY ADVICE TO RUSSIA WOULD BE, TO COIN A
PHRASE, DON'T GET INVOLVED IN A WAR ON THE MAINLAND OF CHINA BECAUSE
THOSE PEOPLE ARE VERY TOUGH AND THERE ARE LOTS OF THEM AND THEY'RE
DUG IN AND THEY'RE INCREDIBLY LIBERATED IN THEIR INDUSTRY, AS
SENATOR STEPHENS SAID, WE SAW A FACTORY IN DANGWANG, WHICH IS A SMALL
COUNTRY SEAT, THAT DOES EVERYTHING FROM CASTING THE STEEL FRAMES FOR
THE GENERATORS TO MAKING THE BALL BEARINGS FOR THEM.
SENATOR STEVENS ANSWER:  AND THEY'RE PEOPLE OF ONE MIND.  I TELL YOU
I DIDN'T SEE ANY DEVIATION  FROM THE PARTY LINE OR FROM ONE MIND.
IT'S BASICALLY WHAT...A UNISEXUAL SOCIETY THAT HAS ONE PURPOSE AND
THAT IS TO STAY BEHIND THAT CENTRAL COMMITTEE.  THE CENTRAL
COMMITTEE IS COMPLETELY IN CHARGE AS FAR AS I AM CONCERNED - IT IS
THE LEADERSHIP OF THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE HEADED BY CHAIRMAN HUA IN MY
OPINION AND THAT IS A DISTINCTION.  I DON'T THINK IT'S A MEANINGLESS
DISTINCTION LIKE MY FRIEND DOES - I THINK IT IS A DISTINCTION BUT
THAT HE'S CORRECT THAT ANY LEADER THAT HAS THAT CENTRAL COMMITTEE
AND THE ARMY BEHIND HIM IS GOING TO LEAD CHINA WITHOUT ANY PROBLEM.
SENATOR YOUNG ANSWER:  IF I COULD ADD JUST ONE WORD - I DON'T THINK
THAT (TWO WORDS OBLITERATED BY SOMEONE COUGHING) ENVIRONMENT (?)
IS THE ONLY NEW MODERN WEAPON THAT THEY ARE MAKING.  THEY ARE MOVING
AHEAD MILITARILY - HERE IS A VERY INTELLIGENT PEOPLE, THE WOMEN ALL
WORK AND SACRIFICE AND THEY COULD BECOME A REAL TOUGH POWER.
SENATOR STEVENS ANSWER:  YES, THAT SUBTERRANEAN SYSTEM OF BOMB SHELTE
