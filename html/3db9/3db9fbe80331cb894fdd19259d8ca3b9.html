		<h3>Tor</h3>
		<p><a href="https://www.torproject.org">Tor</a> is an encrypted anonymising network that makes it harder to intercept internet communications, or see where communications are coming from or going to.</p>
		<p>In order to use the WikiLeaks public submission system as detailed above you can download the Tor Browser Bundle, which is a Firefox-like browser available for Windows, Mac OS X and GNU/Linux and pre-configured to connect using the anonymising system Tor.</p>
		<h4>Tails</h4>
		<p>If you are at high risk and you have the capacity to do so, you can also access the submission system through a secure operating system called <a href="https://tails.boum.org">Tails</a>. Tails is an operating system launched from a USB stick or a DVD that aim to leaves no traces when the computer is shut down after use and automatically routes your internet traffic through Tor. Tails will require you to have either a USB stick or a DVD at least 4GB big and a laptop or desktop computer.</p>

		<h3>Tips</h3>
		<p>Our submission system works hard to preserve your anonymity, but we recommend you also take some of your own precautions. Please review these basic guidelines. </p>
		<div>
			<h4>1. Contact us if you have specific problems</h4>
			<p>If you have a very large submission, or a submission with a complex format, or are a high-risk source, please <a href="#submit_help_contact">contact us</a>. In our experience it is always possible to find a custom solution for even the most seemingly difficult situations.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h4>2. What computer to use</h4>
			<p>If the computer you are uploading from could subsequently be audited in an investigation, consider using a computer that is not easily tied to you. Technical users can also use <a href="https://tails.boum.org">Tails</a> to help ensure you do not leave any records of your submission on the computer.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h4>3. Do not talk about your submission to others</h4>
			<p>If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in source protection – it is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This includes other media organisations.</p>
		</div>

	</div>

		<h3>After</h3>

		<div>
			<h4>1. Do not talk about your submission to others</h4>
			<p>If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in source protection – it is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This includes other media organisations.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h4>2. Act normal</h4>
			<p>If you are a high-risk source, avoid saying anything or doing anything after submitting which might promote suspicion. In particular, you should try to stick to your normal routine and behaviour.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h4>3. Remove traces of your submission</h4>
			<p>If you are a high-risk source and the computer you prepared your submission on, or uploaded it from, could subsequently be audited in an investigation, we recommend that you format and dispose of the computer hard drive and any other storage media you used.</p>
			<p>In particular, hard drives retain data after formatting which may be visible to a digital forensics team and flash media (USB sticks, memory cards and SSD drives) retain data even after a secure erasure. If you used flash media to store sensitive data, it is important to destroy the media.</p>
			<p>If you do this and are a high-risk source you should make sure there are no traces of the clean-up, since such traces themselves may draw suspicion.</p>
			<div>
				<h4>4. If you face legal action</h4>
				<p>If a legal action is brought against you as a result of your submission, there are organisations that may help you. The Courage Foundation is an international organisation dedicated to the protection of journalistic sources. You can find more details at <a href="https://www.couragefound.org">https://www.couragefound.org</a>.</p>

		<p>WikiLeaks publishes documents of political or historical importance that are censored or otherwise suppressed. We specialise in strategic global publishing and large archives.</p>
		<p>The following is the address of our secure site where you can anonymously upload your documents to WikiLeaks editors. You can only access this submissions system through Tor. (See our <a href="#submit_help_tor">Tor tab</a> for more information.) We also advise you to read our <a href="#submit_help_tips">tips for sources</a> before submitting.</p>

			<!--<div>
				Copy this address into your Tor browser. Advanced users, if they wish, can also add a further layer of encryption to their submission using <a href="#submit_wlkey">our public PGP key</a>.
			</div>-->
		</div>

		<p>If you cannot use Tor, or your submission is very large, or you have specific requirements, WikiLeaks provides several alternative methods. <a href="#submit_help_contact">Contact us</a> to discuss how to proceed.</p>

WSJ'S KEATLEY OBSERVES NEW PRC LEADERS SAID LESS THAN EX-

DENUNCIATIONS OF RADICALS CONTINUED WITHOUT SIGN ANY
IMPORTANT SECTOR POPULATION REGRETS THEIR LOSS OF POWER.
SUGGESTS, HOWEVER, THAT HUA'S FAILURE SPEAK SUNDAY COULD
INDICATE SOME LEADERSHIP/POLICY PROBLEMS REMAIN UNRE-
SOLVED.  NOTES SATURDAY WORLD-WIDE TV BROADCAST, BILLED IN
ADVANCE AS IMPORTANT BY PEKING, MERELY SHOWED NEWSREELS OF
DEMONSTRATORS DENOUNCING LEFTISTS AND HAILING HUA;
SUNDAY'S  HUGE RALLY ALSO ADDED LITTLE NEW INFO, OTHER THAN
WU TEH'S COMMENTS THAT MAO, IN HAND-WRITTEN NOTE, NAMED HUA

IN KEATLEY'S VIEW, NEW LEADERS MAY GIVE MORE EMPHASIS TO
FOREIGN TRADE; CAPITAL GOODS/FOREIGN TECHNOLOGY PURCHASES
PROBABLY WILL BE DEEMED MORE IMPORTANT THAN WHEN LEFTISTS

PECULIAR IRONY, SINCE HER GROUP WAS IDENTIFIED WITH MOST
RADICAL, ANTI-FOREIGN, DOCTRINALLY PURE VERSION OF MAOISM.
ISAACS SAYS ENORMOUS BUILD-UP BEING GIVEN HUA CLEARLY
SUGGESTS THERE IS NEED TO MAKE CHINESE PUBLIC MORE
FAMILIAR WITH HIS FACE/PERSONALITY.  IN EARLIER (10/24)
COLUMN, ISAACS OBSERVED THAT SATURDAY TELEVISED PEKING
CELEBRATION WAS ONLY THIRD PRC HAS EVER SENT BY SATELLITE
INTERNATIONALLY (FOLLOWING MOURNING CEREMONIES FOR CHOU/
MAO)--THUS BROADCAST ELEVATED HUA'S ACCESSION TO SAME
HISTORICAL LEVEL WITH THOSE EPOCHAL DEATHS.  NOTED HOW THIS

PRESENTED AMAZING CONTRAST, WITH APPEARANCE OF VAST
CARNIVAL--LIKE ALL NOISY, GAY CHINESE HOLIDAYS IN CALENDAR

BUTTERFIELD (NYT HK) FINDS THAT DESPITE HUA'S RISE/LEFT-
TISTS' DOWNFALL, 5 KEY QUESTIONS REMAIN: WHEN WILL NEW
LEADERS BE NAMED TO FILL MANY TOP CCP GOVT/MIL POSTS;
WHAT WERE ACTUAL CRIMES OF CHIANG CHING AND COMPANIONS,
AND WHAT HAPPENS TO THEM; HOW MUCH SUPPORT DO LEFTISTS
STILL HAVE ON CENTRAL CMTE AND IN PROVINCES, AND WILL THIS
BE CONTINUING PROBLEM; WILL HUA AND ASSOCIATES BE ABLE
RESTORE DISCIPLINE, REVIVE CONFIDENCE IN PARTY'S LEADER-
SHIP; WILL LATEST ABRUPT TURN OF POLITICAL WHEEL TEND TO
DISILLUSION FURTHER MANY YOUNG CHINESE ABOUT POLITICS/
PARTY?  IN MONDAY REPORT, BUTTERFIELD POINTED OUT THAT IN
10/24 CEREMONY, HUA APPEARED FOR FIRST TIME PUBLICLY IN
ARMY UNIFORM--APPARENT TRIBUTE TO IMPORTANT ROLE OF ARMED
FORCES IN LEFTISTS' OUSTER.  REPORTS HK ANALYSTS' VIEW
THAT MAO'S WRITING HUA (AS REPORTED BY WU) OF DESIRE SEE
&quot;YOU IN CHARGE&quot; WAS LESS SPECIFIC THAN MAO SAYING HE ACT-
UALLY INTENDED HUA AS SUCCESSOR.

BUTTERFIELD (10/24) NOTED THAT ALTHOUGH DEMONSTRATIONS
OVER LAST FEW DAYS CLEARLY ORGANIZED, MANY PARTICIPANTS
APPEARED GENUINELY PLEASED.  IN PEKING, MARCHERS SMILED/
WAVED AT FOREIGNERS, EVEN INVITED CHILDREN OF FOREIGN
DIPLS/REPORTERS JOIN IN DEMONSTRATIONS--UNUSUAL GESTURE
IN SOCIETY WHERE FOREIGNERS KEPT AT DISCREET DISTANCE.

VOLUMINOUS BACKLOG OF UNPUBLISHED MAO LETTERS/SPEECHES/
RECORDED DINNER TABLE CONVERSATION TO CHOOSE FROM; BUT
PREDICTS MUCH OF MATERIAL THAT SURFACES IS LIKELY BE OUT OF
CONTEXT--WHICH, IN MAO'S CASE, LEAVES GREAT ROOM FOR
DISTORTION.  TO MATHEWS, WHILE MAO WAS UNDOUBTEDLY CRITICAL

LIKELY HE ALSO PAID THEM COMPLIMENTS THAT NEW LEADERSHIP

MATHEWS (10/25) OBSERVED THAT SUNDAY'S MASSIVE PEKING

SHIFTS IN COMMUNIST POLICY OVER LAST THREE DECADES.

USUAL CHORUS OF COMMENT IN WEST, WHICH ACCEPTS SO READILY
SURFACE MEANING OF PEKING EVENTS, COULD ONCE AGAIN PROVE
WRONG.  SAYS WHAT IS HAPPENING NOW IN PRC IS BEGINNING OF
HISTORICAL CYCLE FORESEEN BY MAO/RADICALS.  MAO'S
PHILOSOPHY OF REBELLION BY MASSES AGAINST PEKING COMMUNIST
BUREAUCRACY HAS ALREADY BEEN SET OUT IN COUNTLESS MILLIONS
OF PAMPHLETS PRINTED IN RECENT YEARS.  CONTENDS THIS
EXISTING BODY OF MAO'S WRITINGS CANNOT BE APPROPRIATED BY
HUA SO EASILY AS MAO'S BODY.  THERE IS GREAT DEAL OF
EXPLOSIVE MATERIAL LAYING AROUND--MAO'S POL/PHILOSOPHICAL
IDEAS--WHICH GIVE RADICALS WEAPON TO USE SOON AS THEY ARE

DENUNCIATIONS OF RADICALS CONTINUED WITHOUT SIGN ANY
IMPORTANT SECTOR POPULATION REGRETS THEIR LOSS OF POWER.

SOLVED.  NOTES SATURDAY WORLD-WIDE TV BROADCAST, BILLED IN

DEMONSTRATORS DENOUNCING LEFTISTS AND HAILING HUA;
SUNDAY'S  HUGE RALLY ALSO ADDED LITTLE NEW INFO, OTHER THAN
WU TEH'S COMMENTS THAT MAO, IN HAND-WRITTEN NOTE, NAMED HUA

PECULIAR IRONY, SINCE HER GROUP WAS IDENTIFIED WITH MOST
RADICAL, ANTI-FOREIGN, DOCTRINALLY PURE VERSION OF MAOISM.
ISAACS SAYS ENORMOUS BUILD-UP BEING GIVEN HUA CLEARLY
SUGGESTS THERE IS NEED TO MAKE CHINESE PUBLIC MORE
FAMILIAR WITH HIS FACE/PERSONALITY.  IN EARLIER (10/24)
COLUMN, ISAACS OBSERVED THAT SATURDAY TELEVISED PEKING
CELEBRATION WAS ONLY THIRD PRC HAS EVER SENT BY SATELLITE
INTERNATIONALLY (FOLLOWING MOURNING CEREMONIES FOR CHOU/
MAO)--THUS BROADCAST ELEVATED HUA'S ACCESSION TO SAME
HISTORICAL LEVEL WITH THOSE EPOCHAL DEATHS.  NOTED HOW THIS

BUTTERFIELD (NYT HK) FINDS THAT DESPITE HUA'S RISE/LEFT-
TISTS' DOWNFALL, 5 KEY QUESTIONS REMAIN: WHEN WILL NEW
LEADERS BE NAMED TO FILL MANY TOP CCP GOVT/MIL POSTS;
WHAT WERE ACTUAL CRIMES OF CHIANG CHING AND COMPANIONS,
AND WHAT HAPPENS TO THEM; HOW MUCH SUPPORT DO LEFTISTS
STILL HAVE ON CENTRAL CMTE AND IN PROVINCES, AND WILL THIS
BE CONTINUING PROBLEM; WILL HUA AND ASSOCIATES BE ABLE
RESTORE DISCIPLINE, REVIVE CONFIDENCE IN PARTY'S LEADER-
SHIP; WILL LATEST ABRUPT TURN OF POLITICAL WHEEL TEND TO
DISILLUSION FURTHER MANY YOUNG CHINESE ABOUT POLITICS/
PARTY?  IN MONDAY REPORT, BUTTERFIELD POINTED OUT THAT IN
10/24 CEREMONY, HUA APPEARED FOR FIRST TIME PUBLICLY IN
ARMY UNIFORM--APPARENT TRIBUTE TO IMPORTANT ROLE OF ARMED
FORCES IN LEFTISTS' OUSTER.  REPORTS HK ANALYSTS' VIEW
THAT MAO'S WRITING HUA (AS REPORTED BY WU) OF DESIRE SEE
&quot;YOU IN CHARGE&quot; WAS LESS SPECIFIC THAN MAO SAYING HE ACT-
UALLY INTENDED HUA AS SUCCESSOR.

BUTTERFIELD (10/24) NOTED THAT ALTHOUGH DEMONSTRATIONS
OVER LAST FEW DAYS CLEARLY ORGANIZED, MANY PARTICIPANTS
APPEARED GENUINELY PLEASED.  IN PEKING, MARCHERS SMILED/
WAVED AT FOREIGNERS, EVEN INVITED CHILDREN OF FOREIGN
DIPLS/REPORTERS JOIN IN DEMONSTRATIONS--UNUSUAL GESTURE
IN SOCIETY WHERE FOREIGNERS KEPT AT DISCREET DISTANCE.

PROGRAM ADOPTED BY NATIONAL AGRIC CONFERENCE.  SAT, BUTTER-
FIELD OBSERVED THAT ALTHOUGH NCNA HAD SAID CHIANG CHING AND
COMPANIONS WERE &quot;LIQUIDATED&quot; AS &quot;BANE&quot; IN PARTY, WORDS IN

WP'S MATHEWS (HK) SEES SUNDAY'S JOINT EDIT AS FIRST OF WHAT

VOLUMINOUS BACKLOG OF UNPUBLISHED MAO LETTERS/SPEECHES/
RECORDED DINNER TABLE CONVERSATION TO CHOOSE FROM; BUT
PREDICTS MUCH OF MATERIAL THAT SURFACES IS LIKELY BE OUT OF
CONTEXT--WHICH, IN MAO'S CASE, LEAVES GREAT ROOM FOR
DISTORTION.  TO MATHEWS, WHILE MAO WAS UNDOUBTEDLY CRITICAL
AT TIMES OF HIS FOUR LEADING RADICAL DISCIPLES, HIGHLY
LIKELY HE ALSO PAID THEM COMPLIMENTS THAT NEW LEADERSHIP
HAS NOT CHOSEN PUBLISH.  SEES HUA'S EDIT WRITERS HAVING
SOMEHOW EXPLAIN WHY RADICALS, IN POWER FOR YEARS, WERE
PURGED IMMEDIATELY AFTER MAO DIED.

MATHEWS (10/25) OBSERVED THAT SUNDAY'S MASSIVE PEKING
GATHERING TO CELEBRATE HUA'S ELEVATION REVEALED FOR FIRST
TIME THAT NO OTHER TOP LEADER APPEARS TARNISHED BY PURGE
OF FOUR LEADING RADICALS.  FINDS HUA'S APPEARANCE FOR

HIMSELF IMMENSELY; ALSO APPEARANCE WANG TUNG-HSING/NI
CHIH-FU INDICATED EVEN THOSE THOUGHT TO HAVE HAD TIES TO
DEPOSED RADICALS HAVE SWUNG AROUND TO SUPPORT HUA.

MORE CAUTIOUS APPROACH TO SOCIALIST CHANGE, MAY BE IN
OFFING.  BUT CAUTIONS THAT ALL SUCH INDICATIONS MUST BE

ZORZA (WP 10/23) SEES CHINESE FACTIONS FOR OWN POLITICAL

SURFACE MEANING OF PEKING EVENTS, COULD ONCE AGAIN PROVE
WRONG.  SAYS WHAT IS HAPPENING NOW IN PRC IS BEGINNING OF
HISTORICAL CYCLE FORESEEN BY MAO/RADICALS.  MAO'S
PHILOSOPHY OF REBELLION BY MASSES AGAINST PEKING COMMUNIST
BUREAUCRACY HAS ALREADY BEEN SET OUT IN COUNTLESS MILLIONS
OF PAMPHLETS PRINTED IN RECENT YEARS.  CONTENDS THIS
EXISTING BODY OF MAO'S WRITINGS CANNOT BE APPROPRIATED BY
HUA SO EASILY AS MAO'S BODY.  THERE IS GREAT DEAL OF
EXPLOSIVE MATERIAL LAYING AROUND--MAO'S POL/PHILOSOPHICAL
IDEAS--WHICH GIVE RADICALS WEAPON TO USE SOON AS THEY ARE
READY ATTEMPT COMEBACK.
