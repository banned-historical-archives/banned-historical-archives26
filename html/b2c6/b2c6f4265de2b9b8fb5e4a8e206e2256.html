		<h3>Tor</h3>
		<p><a href="https://www.torproject.org">Tor</a> is an encrypted anonymising network that makes it harder to intercept internet communications, or see where communications are coming from or going to.</p>
		<p>In order to use the WikiLeaks public submission system as detailed above you can download the Tor Browser Bundle, which is a Firefox-like browser available for Windows, Mac OS X and GNU/Linux and pre-configured to connect using the anonymising system Tor.</p>
		<h4>Tails</h4>
		<p>If you are at high risk and you have the capacity to do so, you can also access the submission system through a secure operating system called <a href="https://tails.boum.org">Tails</a>. Tails is an operating system launched from a USB stick or a DVD that aim to leaves no traces when the computer is shut down after use and automatically routes your internet traffic through Tor. Tails will require you to have either a USB stick or a DVD at least 4GB big and a laptop or desktop computer.</p>

		<h3>Tips</h3>
		<p>Our submission system works hard to preserve your anonymity, but we recommend you also take some of your own precautions. Please review these basic guidelines. </p>
		<div>
			<h4>1. Contact us if you have specific problems</h4>
			<p>If you have a very large submission, or a submission with a complex format, or are a high-risk source, please <a href="#submit_help_contact">contact us</a>. In our experience it is always possible to find a custom solution for even the most seemingly difficult situations.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h4>2. What computer to use</h4>
			<p>If the computer you are uploading from could subsequently be audited in an investigation, consider using a computer that is not easily tied to you. Technical users can also use <a href="https://tails.boum.org">Tails</a> to help ensure you do not leave any records of your submission on the computer.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h4>3. Do not talk about your submission to others</h4>
			<p>If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in source protection – it is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This includes other media organisations.</p>
		</div>

	</div>

		<h3>After</h3>

		<div>
			<h4>1. Do not talk about your submission to others</h4>
			<p>If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in source protection – it is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This includes other media organisations.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h4>2. Act normal</h4>
			<p>If you are a high-risk source, avoid saying anything or doing anything after submitting which might promote suspicion. In particular, you should try to stick to your normal routine and behaviour.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h4>3. Remove traces of your submission</h4>
			<p>If you are a high-risk source and the computer you prepared your submission on, or uploaded it from, could subsequently be audited in an investigation, we recommend that you format and dispose of the computer hard drive and any other storage media you used.</p>
			<p>In particular, hard drives retain data after formatting which may be visible to a digital forensics team and flash media (USB sticks, memory cards and SSD drives) retain data even after a secure erasure. If you used flash media to store sensitive data, it is important to destroy the media.</p>
			<p>If you do this and are a high-risk source you should make sure there are no traces of the clean-up, since such traces themselves may draw suspicion.</p>
			<div>
				<h4>4. If you face legal action</h4>
				<p>If a legal action is brought against you as a result of your submission, there are organisations that may help you. The Courage Foundation is an international organisation dedicated to the protection of journalistic sources. You can find more details at <a href="https://www.couragefound.org">https://www.couragefound.org</a>.</p>

		<p>WikiLeaks publishes documents of political or historical importance that are censored or otherwise suppressed. We specialise in strategic global publishing and large archives.</p>
		<p>The following is the address of our secure site where you can anonymously upload your documents to WikiLeaks editors. You can only access this submissions system through Tor. (See our <a href="#submit_help_tor">Tor tab</a> for more information.) We also advise you to read our <a href="#submit_help_tips">tips for sources</a> before submitting.</p>

			<!--<div>
				Copy this address into your Tor browser. Advanced users, if they wish, can also add a further layer of encryption to their submission using <a href="#submit_wlkey">our public PGP key</a>.
			</div>-->
		</div>

		<p>If you cannot use Tor, or your submission is very large, or you have specific requirements, WikiLeaks provides several alternative methods. <a href="#submit_help_contact">Contact us</a> to discuss how to proceed.</p>

PRINCIPAL CHINESE PRESENT, IN ADDITION TO VICE FOREIGN MINISTER
WANG WERE:
TANG WEN-SHENG, DEPUTY DIRECTOR, AMERICAN AND OCEANIAN
DEPARTMENT, MFA
KO PO-NIEN, VICE PRESIDENT, CHINESE PEOPLE'S INSTITUTE OF
FOREIGN AFFAIRS (CPIFA)
KANG TAI-SHA, DEPUTY SECRETARY-GENERAL, CPIFA.

2. WANG: I WOULD LIKE TO EXTEND A WELCOME TO OUR AMERICAN FRIENDS
ON BEHALF OF MY COLLEAGUES AND TO THANK THEM FOR COMING SO FAR
TO VISIT OUR COUNTRY.

CURTIS: I WOULD LIKE TO EXPRESS MY APPRECIATION FOR THE
OPPORTUNITY TO VISIT YOUR COUNTRY. WE HAVE SEEN SOME OF YOUR
COUNTRYSIDE AND INDUSTRY AND THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU ARE
DEVELOPING YOUR ECONOMY. I ALSO WISH TO EXPRESS MY APPRECIATION
FOR YOUR HOSPITALITY.

WANG: YOU ARE OUR FRIENDS AND WHEN YOU COME OVER TO LOOK AT OUR
COUNTRY IT HELPS PROMOTE MUTUAL UNDERSTANDING BETWEEN US.

CURTIS: WE VALUE THAT FRIENDSHIP. OUR PEOPLE HAVE A WARM FEELING
FOR THE CHINESE PEOPLE. WE ARE HAPPY TO BRING YOU THE GREETINGS
FROM THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.

WANG: THANK YOU. IT IS OUR COMMON DESIRE TO DEVELOP FRIENDSHIP
BETWEEN THE CHINESE AND AMERICAN PEOPLES.

CURTIS: I THINK THAT IS A MUTUAL DESIRE. WE WERE DELIGHTED
WITH YOUR INVITATION TO COME VISIT YOU. WE HAVE SIX SENATORS
AND THEIR WIVES, THREE FROM EACH PARTY. THE THREE DEMOCRATIC
SENATORS ARE VERY INFLUENTIAL WITHIN THAT PARTY AND CLOSE TO
PRESIDENT-ELECT CARTER.
WE ARE HERE NOT ONLY TO SHOW OUR FRIENDSHIP BUT TO LEARN ABOUT YOUR
COUNTRY, TO KNOW MORE ABOUT YOUR ECONOMY AND TO MEET WITH YOU AND
OTHER LEADERS OF YOUR COUNTRY.

WANG: WELL, HOW SHALL WE PROCEED THIS AFTERNOON?

CURTIS: WE ARE YOUR GUESTS. WHATEVER YOU WISH. WE WILL BE GLAD TO
HEAR WHAT YOU HAVE TO SAY.

WANG: IN THAT CASE, WE WELCOME OUR FRIENDS WHO HAVE TRAVELLED SO
FAR TO TAKE THE FLOOR FIRST AND TO EXPRESS YOUR VIEWS ON THE
INTERNATIONAL SITUATION.

CURTIS: WE FEEL VERY STRONGLY OBLIGATED ON OUR PART FOR THE U.S. TO
REMAIN A VERY STRONG POWER. THIS IS NOT ONLY IN OUR INTERESTS BUT
ALSO THAT OF OUR FRIENDS. THERE ARE THOSE WHO HAVE GREAT
AMBITIONS AND WE HOPE TO MAKE OUR CONTRIBUTION TO WORLD PEACE
BY REMAINING THE NUMBER ONE MILITARY POWER. WE FEEL THAT ONE OF THE
BIG FACTORS IN WORLD POLITICS AT PRESENT IS THE SUPPLY OF OIL.
IT HAS SHIFTED SOME OF THE POWER. WE ARE PLEASED TO KNOW THAT YOUR
OIL PRODUCTION IS INCREASING AND WOULD APPRECIATE KNOWING SOMETHING
ABOUT THIS. UNDER OUR SYSTEM OF GOVERNMENT, WE, AS MEMBERS OF
THE U.S. SENATE, ARE NOT EMPOWERED TO CARRY OUT OR ADMINISTER
FOREIGN AFFAIRS. THAT IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE PRESIDENT AND
HIS SECRETARY OF STATE. CONSEQUENTLY, WHILE CERTAIN POLICIES MUST BE
APPROVED BY CONGRESS, WE ARE WITHOUT POWER TO NEGOTIATE WITH
FOREIGN COUNTRIES, MAKE PROPOSALS, OR REACT TO THEM. BUT, IN THE
END, WHAT OUR PRESIDENT PROPOSES OR WHAT THE SECRETARY OF STATE
CARRIES OUT, WE ARE OF COURSE INTERESTED IN. WE WOULD LIKE TO
CARRY BACK WITH US SOME OF YOUR IDEAS AND EXPECTATIONS WITH
REGARD TO MATTERS OF COMMON INTEREST. WE WOULD BE MOST PLEASED
TO HEAR FROM YOU YOUR VIEWS CONCERNING THE CONDUCT AND FUTURE
PLANS OF THE SOVIETS.

WANG: WELL, IT IS DIFFICULT FOR US TO SAY ANYTHING ABOUT THE
CONDUCT AND FUTURE PLANS OF THE SOVIETS. MAYBE THIS QUESTION CAN
BEST BE ANSWERED BY THE CONCRETE ACTIVITIES AND CONDUCT OF THE
SOVIETS IN DAYS TO COME. WHAT THE SOVIET UNION SAYS IS ACTUALLY
UNBELIEVABLE AND IS MEANT TO DECEIVE PEOPLE. THEY TALK OF SHAM
THINGS. THIS CONCLUSION IS DRAWN FROM THE CONDUCT AND ACTIVITIES
OF THE SOVIET UNION.

CURTIS: I CAN SHARE YOUR OPINION. I HAVE GREAT DOUBTS OF MANY
THINGS THEY SAY. I REGARD THEM AS ADVENTURERS AND A POTENTIAL
THREAT. PERHAPS IT WOULD BE BETTER PUT TO ASK WHAT SHOULD BE OUR
COURSE OF ACTION WITH REGARD TO THE SOVIET UNION.

WANG: WHAT COURSE THE U.S. WILL TAKE IS A MATTER FOR THE U.S.
GOVERNMENT. THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT'S ATTITUDE IS TO EXPOSE THEIR
SCHEMES, CRITICIZING AND REPUDIATING THEIR SCHEMES, AND EXPOSING
THEIR DECEPTIONS AND FALLACIES AND ADOPTING A TIT-FOR-TAT STRUGGLE
AGAINST THEM. IN DEALING WITH SOVIET SOCIAL-IMPERIALISM, CHINA AND
THE U.S. HAVE A VERY GREAT POINT IN COMMON. OUR DIFFERENCE OF
PRINCIPLE WITH THE SOVIET UNION MUST CONTINUE TO BE CARRIED OUT.
BUT THE DEBATE ON PRINCIPLES NEED NOT HINDER AND OBSTRUCT STATE
RELATIONS. BUT WE HOLD THAT THE SOVIET SOCIAL-IMPERIALISTS HAVE

FUNDAMENTALLY BETRAYED THE PRINCIPLES OF MARX AND LENIN AND THEIR
IMPERIALISTIC NATURE WILL NEVER CHANGE.

CURTIS: DO YOU FEEL THE SOVIETS ARE A THREAT TO YOUR BORDER?

WANG: PEOPLE SAY THEY HAVE DEPLOYED ONE MILLION TROOPS ALONG THE
BORDER. ONE MILLION TROOPS ALONG A BORDERLINE OF MORE THAN 7,000
KILOMETERS. WHAT USE IS IT TO STATION SO MANY TROOPS ON SUCH A
LONG BORDERLINE? IF THEY DARE TO MOUNT AN INVASION AGAINST US,
I'M SURE THEY WILL BE ANNIHILATED IN THE GREAT SEA OF A PEOPLE'S
WAR. OUR POLICY IS: &quot;WE WILL NOT ATTACK UNLESS WE ARE ATTACKED.
IF ATTACKED WE WILL CERTAINLY COUNTER-ATTACK.&quot; WE HAVE NO FEAR OF
THEM. THE SOVIET THREAT IS MAINLY DIRECTED AGAINST THE U.S.

CURTIS: WHY DO THEY THREATEN THE U.S.?

WANG: BECAUSE THEY WANT TO STRIVE FOR WORLD HEGEMONY. YOU HAVE
INTERESTS IN THE WORLD TO DEFEND AND THE SOVIET UNION SEEKS TO
EXPAND. IN OUR VIEW, SUCH A SITUATION WILL NEVER CHANGE.

CURTIS: I AGREE THAT THEY ARE A SERIOUS ADVERSARY  AND I AM
INTERESTED IN YOUR VIEWS REGARDING THEM.

WANG: SUPERFICIALLY, SOVIET SOCIAL-IMPERIALISM APPEARS WILDLY
CONFIDENTIAL

CONFIDENTIAL

PAGE 02        PEKING 02370  02 OF 04  170240Z

AMBITIOUS. BUT ACTUALLY THEY ARE VERY WEAK. THE IMPERIALISTIC NATURE
OF THEIR POLICIES CAUSES THEM TO CARRY OUT AGGRESSION, EXPANSION,
AND TO BULLY OTHER COUNTRIES ALL OVER THE WORLD, BUT ESSENTIALLY
THEY ARE WEAK. ALTHOUGH WILDLY AMBITIOUS, IF THEY CONTINUE
TO SEEK WORLD HEGEMONY, THEY LACK THE PHYSICAL STRENGTH AND THEY
ARE MOST UNPOPULAR AMONG THE PEOPLE OF THE WORLD.

CURTIS: WHAT IS THE BASIS OF THEIR WEAKNESS?

WANG: THEY ARE CARRYING OUT FASCIST RULE IN THEIR OWN COUNTRY.
INTERNATIONALLY THEY WANT TO ENSLAVE THE PEOPLES OF OTHER
COUNTRIES. THE IRREGULAR DEVELOPMENT OF INDUSTRY IN THEIR COUNTRY,
THE BAD HARVESTS ARE ALL PART OF THIS. WE LOOK UPON THEM AS
PAPER TIGERS AND PAPER TIGERS ARE ALWAYS WEAK. THEIR WEAKNESS IS
DECIDED BY THE NATURE OF SOCIAL-IMPERIALISM. WHAT DO YOU THINK?

CURTIS: MY INDIVIDUAL OPINION IS THAT THEY ARE IMPERIALISTS,
PERMIT NO FREEDOM TO THEIR OWN PEOPLE, AND HAVE AMBITIONS TO
DOMINATE IN THE WORLD. DO YOU BELIEVE THE SOVIETS ARE ANXIOUS TO
TAKE MORE TERRITORY?

WANG: THEY ARE SEEKING HEGEMONY.

CURTIS: SHOULD WE BE CONCERNED ABOUT THE SOVIETS' ACTIVITIES
TOWARDS WESTERN EUROPE?

WANG: YES, WE SHOULD. (WANG APPARENTLY MISUNDERSTOOD QUESTION
AS BEING DIRECTED AT CHINESE ATTITUDES. SHE WAS CORRECTED BY
NANCY TANG.)

CURTIS: DO YOU FAVOR THE U.S. POLICY OF STRENGTHENING NATO AND FULL
SUPPORT OF NATO?

WANG: THIS IS AN AFFAIR OF THE U.S. GOVERNMENT. ON OUR PART, WE ENDORSE

THAT THE US AND WESTERN EUROPE SHOULD ESTABLISH A RELATIONSHIP OF
PARTNERSHIP AND EQUALITY. WE ALSO ENDORSE AND HOPE THAT EUROPE
BECOMES UNITED AND STRONG. TODAY THERE ARE MANY COUNTRIES IN
EUROPE AND THEY SEEM TO BE DIVIDED AND TOO SOFT. WE ENDORSE YOUR
EFFORTS TO IMPROVE RELATIONS WITH EUROPE.

CURTIS: OUR DELEGATION WHICH IS HERE AT YOUR GRACIOUS INVITATION
IS A BIPARTISAN ONE AND THE VICE CHAIRMAN IS THE DISTINGUISHED
SENATOR FROM INDIANA, BIRCH BAYH. I WOULD LIKE TO YIELD TO HIM.

WANG: WELCOME.

BAYH: MADAME VICE FOREIGN MINISTER, I ALSO APPRECIATE YOUR
HOSPITALITY AND DON'T WISH TO IMPOSE TO A GREAT EXTENT. FOR
MOST OF US, THIS IS OUR FIRST VISIT TO CHINA. SENATOR STEVENS OF
ALASKA SERVED HERE DURING OUR COMMON EFFORT AGAIST THE JAPANESE AND
MY FATHER WAS IN KUNMING. WE HAVE HEARD WARM REPORTS OF THE
CHINESE PEOPLE BUT THIS IS OUR FIRST EXPOSURE. I MAKE THESE REMARKS
SO THAT YOU WILL UNDERSTAND THAT MY COMMENTS ON BASED ON A LACK OF
FAMILIARITY AND NOT DESIGNED TO BE OFFENSIVE. BOTH OF OUR COUNTRIES
HAVE GONE THROUGH DRAMATIC TIMES IN THE LAST FEW WEEKS. WE SHARE
YOUR GRIEF AT THE LOSS OF YOUR GREAT CHAIRMAN MAO TSE-TUNG. I
WOULD LIKE TO CONVEY OUR SYMPATHY AT HIS PASSING.

IN THE SAME PERIOD, YOU HAVE A NEW CHAIRMAN, MR. HUA. YOU HAVE
ALSO HAD A NATURAL DISASTER AND HAVE DISPLAYED A MARVELOUS ABILITY
TO BOUNCE BACK. AT THE SAME TIME OUR COUNTRY HAS TRIED TO STRENGTHEN
OURSELVES ECONOMICALLY AND WE
HAVE HAD THE QUADRENNIAL EXERCISE OF POLITICAL ELECTIONS. THESE
THINGS ARE NOW BEHIND US FOR BOTH THE US AND CHINA. NOW TO THE
FUTURE. I APOLOGIZE FOR SPEAKING SO LONG. WE HERE OF COURSE WISH
TO SUSTAIN THE INITIATIVE TAKEN BY CHAIRMAN MAO, FORMER PRESIDENT
NIXON, PREMIER CHOU, AND SECRETARY KISSINGER TO TRY TO MOVE TOWARD
NORMAL RELATIONS. NOW WE HAVE NEW LEADERS. WHAT DO YOU SEE IN OUR
RELATIONSHIP UNDER CHAIRMAN HUA AS OPPOSED TO THAT UNDER CHAIRMAN
MAO? WE READ OF THE GANG OF FOUR HAVING BEEN OPPOSED TO THIS
RELATIONSHIP STARTED BY MAO AND CHOU. I THINK WE CAN ALL SPEAK
WITH SOME AUTHORITY THAT OUR NEW PRESIDENT IS DETERMINED TO MOVE
TOWARD NORMALIZATION UNDER THE PRINCIPLES OF THE SHANGHAI
COMMUNIQUE. WE CANNOT BE CERTAIN OF YOUR ATTITUDE. COULD YOU
ENLIGHTEN US, PLEASE?

WANG: IT IS TRUE THAT HIS YEAR CHOU EN-LAI, CHAIRMAN CHU TEH OF
THE NATIONAL PEOPLE'S CONGRESS AND CHAIRMAN MAO ALL PASSED AWAY
UNFORTUNATELY. THE CHINESE PEOPLE WERE DEEPLY GRIEVED IN
PARTICULAR WITH THE PASSING AWAY OF OUR GREAT LEADER, CHAIRMAN
MAO. BUT I'M SURE YOU WILL BE ABLE TO WITNESS FROM OUR

STRENGTH. THEY ARE ALSO DETERMINED TO CARRY ON THE BEHEST OF
CHAIRMAN MAO AND RESOLUTELY IMPLEMENT THE POLICIES AND LINE FORMU-
LATED BY CHAIRMAN MAO, AND TO CARRY THROUGH TO THE END THE REVOLU-
TIONARY CAUSE PIONEERED BY HIM. CHAIRMAN HUA WAS PERSONALLY
SELECTED BY CHAIRMAN MAO BEFORE HE DIED TO BE HIS SUCCESSOR TO
THE REVOLUTIONARY CAUSE. CHAIRMAN HUA HAS BEEN LOYAL TO MARX-
LENINISM-MAO TSE-TUNG THOUGHT. MAYBE YOU HAVE ALSO HEARD OF
THE WORDS OF CHAIRMAN MAO WHEN HE WAS ALIVE AND SPOKEN TO CHAIRMAN
HUA THAT &quot;WITH YOU IN CHARGE, I'M AT EASE.&quot; YOU CAN SEE CHAIRMAN

HUA IS RESOLUTELY CARRYING OUT AND IMPLEMENTING THE POLICIES
FORMULATED BY CHAIRMAN MAO. WITH CHAIRMAN MAO AT EASE, THE
800,000,000 CHINESE PEOPLE ARE EVEN MORE AT EASE BECAUSE THE
SUCCESSOR OF THE REVOLUTIONARY CAUSE WAS SELECTED AND
ARRANGED BY CHAIRMAN MAO WHILE HE WAS ALIVE. AS TO THE GANG OF
FOUR, YOU'VE HEARD OF THEM -- WANG HUNG-WEN, CHANG CHUN-CHIAO,
CHIANG CHING, YAO WEN-YUAN -- THEY CONSTITUTED AN ANTI-PARTY
CLIQUE. THEY FRENZIEDLY OPPOSED CHAIRMAN MAO, OPPOSED HIS THOUGHT,
AND FRANTICALLY OPPOSED THE POLICIES AND LINE FORMULATED FOR US
PERSONALLY BY CHAIRMAN MAO. THEY ENGAGED IN SCHEMING ACTIVITIES A
AND PLOTTED TO USURP PARTY AND STATE POWER. WHEN CHAIRMAN MAO WAS
STILL ALIVE, HE CRITICIZED THEM FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS, TRIED TO
EDUCATE THEM WHEN HE SAW THEN ENGAGING IN REVISIONISM, SPLITTISM,
AND SCHEMING. BECAUSE CHAIRMAN MAO DISCOVERED THIS SCHEME IN
TIMELY FASHION AND ACTED AND EXPOSED THEM THEY WERE UNABLE TO
SUCCEED WHILE CHAIRMAN MAO WAS ALIVE. WHEN CHAIRMAN MAO PASSED
AWAY, THEY AGAIN ENGAGED IN FRENZIED OPPOSITION TO CHAIRMAN HUA,
WHO HAD BEEN SELECTED AS SUCCESSOR TO THE REVOLUTIONARY CAUSE
BY CHAIRMAN MAO WHEN HE WAS ALIVE. THEY PLOTTED TO USURP THE
SUPREME PARTY AND STATE POWER. WHY WERE THEY SO FRENZIEDLY OPPOSED
TO CHAIRMAN HUA? JUST BECAUSE CHAIRMAN HUA RESOLUTELY INHERITED
THE BEHEST OF CHAIRMAN MAO, RESOLUTELY CARRIED OUT THE POLICIES

PAGE 02        PEKING 02370  03 OF 04  170503Z

AND LINE OF CHAIRMAN MAO, AND REMAINS INFINITELY LOYAL TO HIS
THOUGHT. CHAIRMAN HUA HAD BEEN WAGING A RESOLUTE STRUGGLE
AGAINST THEIR SCHEMING ACTIVITIES. ORIGINALLY, CHAIRMAN MAO WANTED
TO SETTLE THE QUESTION OF THE GANG OF FOUR WHILE HE WAS
ALIVE BUT UNFORTUNATELY BEFORE HE COULD DO SO, HE PASSED AWAY.
CHAIRMAN HUA BROUGHT ABOUT THE SOLUTION OF THIS ISSUE WHICH CHAIR-
MAN MAO WISHED TO BUT WAS UNABLE TO BECAUSE OF HIS DEATH. CHAIRMAN
HUA WITH ONE STROKE SMASHED THE PLOT OF THE GANG OF FOUR TO USURP
PARTY AND STATE POWER. IN THIS WAY, UNDER THE LEADERSHIP OF THE
CENTRAL COMMITTEE HEADED BY CHAIRMAN HUA, WE ARE EVEN MORE DETER-
MINED TO CARRY OUT THE LINE AND POLICIES OF CHAIRMAN MAO.

BAYH: DOES THIS MEAN THAT YOU WILL CONTINUE TO FOLLOW THE PRINCIPLES
OF THE SHANGHAI COMMUNIQUE TO MOVE TOWARDS NORMALIZATION?

WANG: OF COURSE. THE LINES AND POLICIES FORMULATED BY CHAIRMAN MAO
ALSO INCLUDE FOREIGN POLICY AND UNDER THE LEADERSHIP OF THE CENTRAL
COMMITTEE HEADED BY CHAIRMAN HUA, WE WILL RESOLUTELY IMPLEMENT
SUCH LINES AND POLICIES. ON THE QUESTION OF NORMALIZATION BETWEEN
OUR TWO COUNTRIES, AS I HAVE OFTEN
STATED TO AMERICAN FRIENDS AND MR. GATES OF THE LIAISON OFFICE
UNDERSTANDS WELL, IF BOTH PARTIES ADHERE TO THE PRINCIPLES OF THE
SHANGHAI COMMUNIQUE RELATIONS BETWEEN THE U.S. AND CHINA CAN BE
IMPROVED. THIS WAS STATED BY PREMIER CHOU IN HIS REPORT TO THE
FOURTH NPC. ON THE QUESTION OF NORMALIZATION BETWEEN OUR TWO
COUNTRIES, WE HAVE THREE PRINCIPLES WHICH WE HAVE TIME AND AGAIN
STATED. I AM SURE YOU ARE FAMILIAR WITH THEM BUT I WOULD LIKE TO
CLEARLY STATE THEM FOR YOU. THE THREE PRINCIPLES ARE: SEVER
DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS BETWEEN THE U.S. AND TAIWAN; WITHDRAWAL OF
AMERICAN TROOPS FROM TAIWAN, AND ABROGATION OF THE SO-CALLED
DEFENSE TREATY WITH TAIWAN. THESE ARE INSEPARABLE AND INDISPEN-
SABLE. THERE CAN BE NO OTHER ALTERNATIVE. ON THE QUESTION OF TAIWAN,
WE DO NOT BELIEVE IN THE SO-CALLED PEACEFUL TRANSITION. CHAIRMAN
TAUGHT US &quot;WHERE THE BROOM DOESN'T REACH, DUST WILL NOT RUN AWAY
BY ITSELF.&quot; IN TAIWAN, THERE IS STILL A BUNCH OF COUNTER-REVO-
LUTIONARIES. OUR STAND ON TAIWAN IS THAT WE BASE OURSELVES ON
A FOOTING TO FIGHT. AS TO WHEN WE WILL LIBERATE TAIWAN AND THE
METHODS WE WILL ADOPT TO LIBERATE TAIWAN, THIS IS PURELY AN
INTERNAL MATTER FOR CHINA AND NO OTHER NATION HAS THE RIGHT TO
INTERFERE WHATSOEVER. SINCE YOU RAISED THIS ISSUE, I HAVE STATED
OUR CONSISTENT STAND VERY CANDIDLY.

BAYH: I APPRECIATE YOUR CANDOR. OUR NATION REMAINS COMMITTED TO
THE SHANGHAI COMMUNIQUE ALTHOUGH WE REALIZE THERE MIGHT BE
SOME DIFFICULTIES. BUT WE ARE DEDICATED TO THIS PURPOSE AND
OUR DISTINGUISHED REPRESENTATIVE AMBASSADOR GATES HAS STRESSED TO
US THE THREE PRINCIPLES WITH THE VICE FOREIGN MINISTER HAS
MENTIONED. ONE LAST THING--
AFTER TALKING WITH OUTSTANDING LEADERS LIKE YOURSELF, AND
MEETING WITH OUR HOSTS WHO ARE OUTSTANDING AMBASSADORS OF GOOD-
WILL, I AM CONVINCED THAT OUR TWO NATIONS HAVE SO MUCH TO OFFER
TO EACH OTHER AND TO THE WORLD. I AM CERTAIN THAT IF OUR TWO
NATIONS ARE INTERESTED IN SOLVING THESE QUESTIONS, WE CAN FIND A
METHOD TO RESOLVE OUR DIFFERENCES.

WANG: BETWEEN FRIENDS, WE CAN HAVE A CANDID EXCHANGE OF
VIEWS. BETWEEN CHINA AND THE U.S. THERE ARE MANY COMMON POINTS ON
MANY ISSUES. THE BIG ISSUE IS THE INTERNATIONAL ONE, TAIWAN IS A
MINOR ISSUE. AMONG THE MANY COMMON
POINTS WE SHARE, THE MOST IMPORTANT IS TO DEAL IN COMMON WITH
OUR NORTHERN SO-CALLED ALLY.

BAYH: WE HAVE A SAYING THAT WITH FRIENDS LIKE THAT WE DON'T
NEED ENEMIES.

CURTIS: WE DO HAVE SOMETHING VERY MUCH IN COMMON -- THE PROTECTION
OF THINGS WE HOLD DEAR AGAINST THE SOVIETS, JUST AS YOU HAVE. THE
FACT THAT YOU EXTENDED AN INVITATION TO US AND THAT WE WERE ABLE
TO ACCEPT IT HAS LED TO BETTER UNDERSTANDING. I COMMEND YOU ON
INVITING US TO VISIT HERE. WE ALSO COMMEND YOU ON YOUR STATEMENT
THAT THE LARGE PICTURE IS WORLD AFFAIRS, AND THE WELFARE OF YOUR
GREAT COUNTRY AND OUR COUNTRY WITH RESPECT TO THE SOVIET UNION.
WE ALSO FEEL THAT WAY. WE ARE PLEASED TO HEAR YOU SAY THAT THE
PROBLEM OF TAIWAN IS SECONDARY TO THESE WORLD PROBLEMS. TAIWAN IS
A PROBLEM FOR US AS WELL AND WE HOPE THAT EVENTUALLY THERE WILL BE
A PEACEFUL SOLUTION.

WANG (SMILING BROADLY): I ALREADY STATED THAT WE DON'T BELIEVE IN
PEACEFUL TRANSITION AND THAT HAS ALWAYS BEEN OUR CONSISTENT STAND.

CURTIS: YOU MUST REALIZE THAT WHEN A NATION SUCH AS OURS FOLLOWS
A COURSE OF CONDUCT FOR DECADES, IT IS DIFFICULT TO CHANGE. JUST

AS YOU HAVE PROBLEMS, WE HAVE PROBLEMS.

BAYH: TIME IS ALL TOO SHORT AND ESPECIALLY I'VE ALREADY HAD SOME
TIME TO SPEAK. THIS FIRST VISIT TO CHINA HAS BEEN AN EYE-OPENER.
AS MUCH AS I HAD RESPECTED YOUR COUNTRY AND YOUR PEOPLE, I NOW
RESPECT THEM EVEN MORE. I AM CONVINCED THAT IT IS POSSIBLE FOR
MORE CHINESE TO COME TO THE U.S. I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE A SLIGHT
SUGGESTION. I AM CONVINCED IT CAN RESOLVE SOME PROBLEMS.
RELATIONS COULD BE MORE SUPPORTIVE THROUGH BROADER EXCHANGE
PROGRAMS, MORE TRADE, AND OTHER WAYS OF GETTING TO KNOW ONE ANOTHER
BETTER. EWE'VE HAD THIS OPPORTUNITY BUT THERE ARE ONLY SIX OF US.
IF THERE WERE 600 YOU WOULD HAVE 600 MISSIONARIES GOING BACK.

WANG: SINCE THE DOORS BETWEEN CHINA AND THE US WERE OPENED BY
YOUR FORMER PRESIDENT NIXON, AND BY CHAIRMAN MAO, AND AFTER THE
ISSUANCE OF THE SHANGHAI COMMUNIQUE, THERE HAVE BEEN QUITE A FEW
EXCHANGES BETWEEN CHINA AND THE U.S.

CURTIS: YOU HAVE BEEN A MOST GRACIOUS HOSTESS. BEFORE WE END, I
WONDER IF MY COLLEAGUES HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY.

YOUNG: WE DEEPLY APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO COME TO KNOW YOU
BETTER. WE WILL KNOW YOU MORE IN THE FUTURE. THE U.S. IS SPREAD
THINLY OVER THE WORLD BUT WE ARE BOUND NOT BECOME SECOND TO THE
SOVIET UNION. STILL, THERE ARE PROBLEMS -- THE PHILIPPINES WANT US
TO REMOVE OUR BASES. WE HAVE PROBLEMS ALL OVER THE WORLD AND THAT'S
WHY WE NEED FRIENDS LIKE YOU.

SENATOR BAYH HAS POINTED OUT, THIS VISIT HAS BEEN AN EYE OPENER.
CHINA HAS A BIG PART OF THE WORLD'S POPULATION AND THE U.S.
AND CHINA SHOULD BE WORKING TOGETHER FOR PEACE IN THE FUTURE.
I THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO MEET
YOU THIS AFTERNOON.

IT IS MOST MEMORABLE FOR ME TO COME BACK AGAIN. I WOULD LIKE AT

SOME TIME TO EXPLORE WHY WE CANNOT HAVE SOME OF THE STEPS THAT LEAD
TOWARDS NORMALIZATION PRIOR TO THE REALIZATION OF THE PRINCIPLES
YOU HAVE MENTIONED, SUCH AS AIR ROUTES, EXPANSION OF EXCHANGES.
I THINK, AND IT MAY BE IMPORTANT, SOMETIMES I'M NOT SURE YOU ARE
FULLY COGNIZANT OF THE DIFFICULTIES WE FACE, AND INCREASED
EXCHANGES WOULD HELP YOU BECOME AWARE OF THESE PROBLEMS.

JOHNSTON: MADAME VICE FOREIGN MINISTER, I WOULD LIKE TO ADD MY
GRATITUDE TO THAT OF MY COLLEAGUES. ONE QUESTION OF SUBSTANCE IS
RELATED TO KOREA. IN THE COMING SESSION OF CONGRESS IN JANUARY,
SOME COLLEAGUES WILL BE CALLING FOR THE WITHDRAWAL OF TROOPS
THERE. MAY WE REPORT TO OUR COLLEAGUES THAT THE RETENTION OF TROOPS
AND THE TREATY WITH KOREA WILL NOT BE A MAJOR STUMBLING BLOCK IN
IMPLEMENTING THE SHANGHAI COMMUNIQUE OR A BLOCK TO THE IMPROVEMENT
OF OUR RELATIONS?

WANG: ON KOREA, OUR STAND IS CONSISTENT. WE SUPPORT THE
STAND OF THE DPRK ON INDEPENDENT AND PEACEFUL REUNIFICATION OF
KOREA AND THAT ALL US TROOPS SHOULD BE WITHDRAWN AND THE UNC
DISBANDED. THE ISSUE OF KOREA
SHOULD BE LEFT TO THE KOREAN PEOPLE THEMSELVES TO SETTLE.
THIS HAS BEEN OUR PRINCIPLED STAND.

CURTIS: AMBASSADOR GATES, DO YOU HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY?

GATES: WE'RE OLD FRIENDS.

WANG: I WELCOME YOUR COMING HERE AND THE EXCHANGE OF VIEWS. THEY
WILL HELP PROMOTE MUTUAL UNDERSTANDING BETWEEN US.

CURTIS: WE BELIEVE MUCH AS BEEN GAINED. YOU ARE A CHARMING
HOSTESS.

WANG: OUR EXCHANGE OF VIEWS AND DISCUSSION WILL HELP UNDERSTANDING
BUT WHEN YOU LEAVE PEKING AND VISIT OTHER PARTS OF OUR COUNTRY
YOU WILL UNDERSTAND MORE WHAT HAPPENS IN OUR COUNTTRY. YOU CAN
WITNESS FOR YOURSELF HOW THE PEOPLE BRING THEIR INITIATIVE INTO
FULL PLAY AND RELY ON THEIR OWN EFFORTS TO BRING ABOUT SOCIAL-

2. WANG: I WOULD LIKE TO EXTEND A WELCOME TO OUR AMERICAN FRIENDS
ON BEHALF OF MY COLLEAGUES AND TO THANK THEM FOR COMING SO FAR
TO VISIT OUR COUNTRY.

CURTIS: I WOULD LIKE TO EXPRESS MY APPRECIATION FOR THE
OPPORTUNITY TO VISIT YOUR COUNTRY. WE HAVE SEEN SOME OF YOUR
COUNTRYSIDE AND INDUSTRY AND THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU ARE
DEVELOPING YOUR ECONOMY. I ALSO WISH TO EXPRESS MY APPRECIATION
FOR YOUR HOSPITALITY.

WANG: YOU ARE OUR FRIENDS AND WHEN YOU COME OVER TO LOOK AT OUR
COUNTRY IT HELPS PROMOTE MUTUAL UNDERSTANDING BETWEEN US.

CURTIS: WE VALUE THAT FRIENDSHIP. OUR PEOPLE HAVE A WARM FEELING
FOR THE CHINESE PEOPLE. WE ARE HAPPY TO BRING YOU THE GREETINGS
FROM THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.

WANG: THANK YOU. IT IS OUR COMMON DESIRE TO DEVELOP FRIENDSHIP
BETWEEN THE CHINESE AND AMERICAN PEOPLES.

CURTIS: I THINK THAT IS A MUTUAL DESIRE. WE WERE DELIGHTED
WITH YOUR INVITATION TO COME VISIT YOU. WE HAVE SIX SENATORS
AND THEIR WIVES, THREE FROM EACH PARTY. THE THREE DEMOCRATIC
SENATORS ARE VERY INFLUENTIAL WITHIN THAT PARTY AND CLOSE TO
PRESIDENT-ELECT CARTER.
WE ARE HERE NOT ONLY TO SHOW OUR FRIENDSHIP BUT TO LEARN ABOUT YOUR
COUNTRY, TO KNOW MORE ABOUT YOUR ECONOMY AND TO MEET WITH YOU AND

CURTIS: WE ARE YOUR GUESTS. WHATEVER YOU WISH. WE WILL BE GLAD TO
HEAR WHAT YOU HAVE TO SAY.

WANG: IN THAT CASE, WE WELCOME OUR FRIENDS WHO HAVE TRAVELLED SO
FAR TO TAKE THE FLOOR FIRST AND TO EXPRESS YOUR VIEWS ON THE
INTERNATIONAL SITUATION.

CURTIS: WE FEEL VERY STRONGLY OBLIGATED ON OUR PART FOR THE U.S. TO
REMAIN A VERY STRONG POWER. THIS IS NOT ONLY IN OUR INTERESTS BUT
ALSO THAT OF OUR FRIENDS. THERE ARE THOSE WHO HAVE GREAT
AMBITIONS AND WE HOPE TO MAKE OUR CONTRIBUTION TO WORLD PEACE
BY REMAINING THE NUMBER ONE MILITARY POWER. WE FEEL THAT ONE OF THE
BIG FACTORS IN WORLD POLITICS AT PRESENT IS THE SUPPLY OF OIL.
IT HAS SHIFTED SOME OF THE POWER. WE ARE PLEASED TO KNOW THAT YOUR
OIL PRODUCTION IS INCREASING AND WOULD APPRECIATE KNOWING SOMETHING
ABOUT THIS. UNDER OUR SYSTEM OF GOVERNMENT, WE, AS MEMBERS OF
THE U.S. SENATE, ARE NOT EMPOWERED TO CARRY OUT OR ADMINISTER
FOREIGN AFFAIRS. THAT IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE PRESIDENT AND
HIS SECRETARY OF STATE. CONSEQUENTLY, WHILE CERTAIN POLICIES MUST BE
APPROVED BY CONGRESS, WE ARE WITHOUT POWER TO NEGOTIATE WITH
FOREIGN COUNTRIES, MAKE PROPOSALS, OR REACT TO THEM. BUT, IN THE
END, WHAT OUR PRESIDENT PROPOSES OR WHAT THE SECRETARY OF STATE
CARRIES OUT, WE ARE OF COURSE INTERESTED IN. WE WOULD LIKE TO
CARRY BACK WITH US SOME OF YOUR IDEAS AND EXPECTATIONS WITH
REGARD TO MATTERS OF COMMON INTEREST. WE WOULD BE MOST PLEASED
TO HEAR FROM YOU YOUR VIEWS CONCERNING THE CONDUCT AND FUTURE
PLANS OF THE SOVIETS.

WANG: WELL, IT IS DIFFICULT FOR US TO SAY ANYTHING ABOUT THE
CONDUCT AND FUTURE PLANS OF THE SOVIETS. MAYBE THIS QUESTION CAN
BEST BE ANSWERED BY THE CONCRETE ACTIVITIES AND CONDUCT OF THE
SOVIETS IN DAYS TO COME. WHAT THE SOVIET UNION SAYS IS ACTUALLY
UNBELIEVABLE AND IS MEANT TO DECEIVE PEOPLE. THEY TALK OF SHAM
THINGS. THIS CONCLUSION IS DRAWN FROM THE CONDUCT AND ACTIVITIES
OF THE SOVIET UNION.

CURTIS: I CAN SHARE YOUR OPINION. I HAVE GREAT DOUBTS OF MANY
THINGS THEY SAY. I REGARD THEM AS ADVENTURERS AND A POTENTIAL
THREAT. PERHAPS IT WOULD BE BETTER PUT TO ASK WHAT SHOULD BE OUR
COURSE OF ACTION WITH REGARD TO THE SOVIET UNION.

WANG: WHAT COURSE THE U.S. WILL TAKE IS A MATTER FOR THE U.S.
GOVERNMENT. THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT'S ATTITUDE IS TO EXPOSE THEIR
SCHEMES, CRITICIZING AND REPUDIATING THEIR SCHEMES, AND EXPOSING
THEIR DECEPTIONS AND FALLACIES AND ADOPTING A TIT-FOR-TAT STRUGGLE
AGAINST THEM. IN DEALING WITH SOVIET SOCIAL-IMPERIALISM, CHINA AND
THE U.S. HAVE A VERY GREAT POINT IN COMMON. OUR DIFFERENCE OF
PRINCIPLE WITH THE SOVIET UNION MUST CONTINUE TO BE CARRIED OUT.
BUT THE DEBATE ON PRINCIPLES NEED NOT HINDER AND OBSTRUCT STATE
RELATIONS. BUT WE HOLD THAT THE SOVIET SOCIAL-IMPERIALISTS HAVE

FUNDAMENTALLY BETRAYED THE PRINCIPLES OF MARX AND LENIN AND THEIR
IMPERIALISTIC NATURE WILL NEVER CHANGE.

CURTIS: DO YOU FEEL THE SOVIETS ARE A THREAT TO YOUR BORDER?

WANG: PEOPLE SAY THEY HAVE DEPLOYED ONE MILLION TROOPS ALONG THE
BORDER. ONE MILLION TROOPS ALONG A BORDERLINE OF MORE THAN 7,000
KILOMETERS. WHAT USE IS IT TO STATION SO MANY TROOPS ON SUCH A
LONG BORDERLINE? IF THEY DARE TO MOUNT AN INVASION AGAINST US,
I'M SURE THEY WILL BE ANNIHILATED IN THE GREAT SEA OF A PEOPLE'S
WAR. OUR POLICY IS: &quot;WE WILL NOT ATTACK UNLESS WE ARE ATTACKED.
IF ATTACKED WE WILL CERTAINLY COUNTER-ATTACK.&quot; WE HAVE NO FEAR OF
THEM. THE SOVIET THREAT IS MAINLY DIRECTED AGAINST THE U.S.

CURTIS: WHY DO THEY THREATEN THE U.S.?

WANG: BECAUSE THEY WANT TO STRIVE FOR WORLD HEGEMONY. YOU HAVE
INTERESTS IN THE WORLD TO DEFEND AND THE SOVIET UNION SEEKS TO
EXPAND. IN OUR VIEW, SUCH A SITUATION WILL NEVER CHANGE.

CURTIS: I AGREE THAT THEY ARE A SERIOUS ADVERSARY  AND I AM
INTERESTED IN YOUR VIEWS REGARDING THEM.

AMBITIOUS. BUT ACTUALLY THEY ARE VERY WEAK. THE IMPERIALISTIC NATURE
OF THEIR POLICIES CAUSES THEM TO CARRY OUT AGGRESSION, EXPANSION,
AND TO BULLY OTHER COUNTRIES ALL OVER THE WORLD, BUT ESSENTIALLY
THEY ARE WEAK. ALTHOUGH WILDLY AMBITIOUS, IF THEY CONTINUE
TO SEEK WORLD HEGEMONY, THEY LACK THE PHYSICAL STRENGTH AND THEY
ARE MOST UNPOPULAR AMONG THE PEOPLE OF THE WORLD.

CURTIS: WHAT IS THE BASIS OF THEIR WEAKNESS?

WANG: THEY ARE CARRYING OUT FASCIST RULE IN THEIR OWN COUNTRY.
INTERNATIONALLY THEY WANT TO ENSLAVE THE PEOPLES OF OTHER
COUNTRIES. THE IRREGULAR DEVELOPMENT OF INDUSTRY IN THEIR COUNTRY,
THE BAD HARVESTS ARE ALL PART OF THIS. WE LOOK UPON THEM AS
PAPER TIGERS AND PAPER TIGERS ARE ALWAYS WEAK. THEIR WEAKNESS IS
DECIDED BY THE NATURE OF SOCIAL-IMPERIALISM. WHAT DO YOU THINK?

CURTIS: MY INDIVIDUAL OPINION IS THAT THEY ARE IMPERIALISTS,
PERMIT NO FREEDOM TO THEIR OWN PEOPLE, AND HAVE AMBITIONS TO
DOMINATE IN THE WORLD. DO YOU BELIEVE THE SOVIETS ARE ANXIOUS TO
TAKE MORE TERRITORY?

WANG: THEY ARE SEEKING HEGEMONY.

CURTIS: SHOULD WE BE CONCERNED ABOUT THE SOVIETS' ACTIVITIES
TOWARDS WESTERN EUROPE?

WANG: YES, WE SHOULD. (WANG APPARENTLY MISUNDERSTOOD QUESTION
AS BEING DIRECTED AT CHINESE ATTITUDES. SHE WAS CORRECTED BY
NANCY TANG.)

CURTIS: DO YOU FAVOR THE U.S. POLICY OF STRENGTHENING NATO AND FULL
SUPPORT OF NATO?

WANG: THIS IS AN AFFAIR OF THE U.S. GOVERNMENT. ON OUR PART, WE ENDORSE

THAT THE US AND WESTERN EUROPE SHOULD ESTABLISH A RELATIONSHIP OF
PARTNERSHIP AND EQUALITY. WE ALSO ENDORSE AND HOPE THAT EUROPE
BECOMES UNITED AND STRONG. TODAY THERE ARE MANY COUNTRIES IN
EUROPE AND THEY SEEM TO BE DIVIDED AND TOO SOFT. WE ENDORSE YOUR

ALASKA SERVED HERE DURING OUR COMMON EFFORT AGAIST THE JAPANESE AND
MY FATHER WAS IN KUNMING. WE HAVE HEARD WARM REPORTS OF THE
CHINESE PEOPLE BUT THIS IS OUR FIRST EXPOSURE. I MAKE THESE REMARKS
SO THAT YOU WILL UNDERSTAND THAT MY COMMENTS ON BASED ON A LACK OF
FAMILIARITY AND NOT DESIGNED TO BE OFFENSIVE. BOTH OF OUR COUNTRIES
HAVE GONE THROUGH DRAMATIC TIMES IN THE LAST FEW WEEKS. WE SHARE
YOUR GRIEF AT THE LOSS OF YOUR GREAT CHAIRMAN MAO TSE-TUNG. I
WOULD LIKE TO CONVEY OUR SYMPATHY AT HIS PASSING.

IN THE SAME PERIOD, YOU HAVE A NEW CHAIRMAN, MR. HUA. YOU HAVE
ALSO HAD A NATURAL DISASTER AND HAVE DISPLAYED A MARVELOUS ABILITY
TO BOUNCE BACK. AT THE SAME TIME OUR COUNTRY HAS TRIED TO STRENGTHEN
OURSELVES ECONOMICALLY AND WE
HAVE HAD THE QUADRENNIAL EXERCISE OF POLITICAL ELECTIONS. THESE
THINGS ARE NOW BEHIND US FOR BOTH THE US AND CHINA. NOW TO THE
FUTURE. I APOLOGIZE FOR SPEAKING SO LONG. WE HERE OF COURSE WISH
TO SUSTAIN THE INITIATIVE TAKEN BY CHAIRMAN MAO, FORMER PRESIDENT
NIXON, PREMIER CHOU, AND SECRETARY KISSINGER TO TRY TO MOVE TOWARD
NORMAL RELATIONS. NOW WE HAVE NEW LEADERS. WHAT DO YOU SEE IN OUR
RELATIONSHIP UNDER CHAIRMAN HUA AS OPPOSED TO THAT UNDER CHAIRMAN
MAO? WE READ OF THE GANG OF FOUR HAVING BEEN OPPOSED TO THIS
RELATIONSHIP STARTED BY MAO AND CHOU. I THINK WE CAN ALL SPEAK
WITH SOME AUTHORITY THAT OUR NEW PRESIDENT IS DETERMINED TO MOVE
TOWARD NORMALIZATION UNDER THE PRINCIPLES OF THE SHANGHAI
COMMUNIQUE. WE CANNOT BE CERTAIN OF YOUR ATTITUDE. COULD YOU
ENLIGHTEN US, PLEASE?

WANG: IT IS TRUE THAT HIS YEAR CHOU EN-LAI, CHAIRMAN CHU TEH OF
THE NATIONAL PEOPLE'S CONGRESS AND CHAIRMAN MAO ALL PASSED AWAY
UNFORTUNATELY. THE CHINESE PEOPLE WERE DEEPLY GRIEVED IN
PARTICULAR WITH THE PASSING AWAY OF OUR GREAT LEADER, CHAIRMAN
MAO. BUT I'M SURE YOU WILL BE ABLE TO WITNESS FROM OUR

NEWSPAPERS THAT THE CHINESE PEOPLE ARE HEEDING THE CALL BY THE
CENTRAL COMMITTEE HEADED BY CHAIRMAN HUA TO TURN GRIEF INTO
STRENGTH. THEY ARE ALSO DETERMINED TO CARRY ON THE BEHEST OF
CHAIRMAN MAO AND RESOLUTELY IMPLEMENT THE POLICIES AND LINE FORMU-
LATED BY CHAIRMAN MAO, AND TO CARRY THROUGH TO THE END THE REVOLU-
TIONARY CAUSE PIONEERED BY HIM. CHAIRMAN HUA WAS PERSONALLY
SELECTED BY CHAIRMAN MAO BEFORE HE DIED TO BE HIS SUCCESSOR TO
THE REVOLUTIONARY CAUSE. CHAIRMAN HUA HAS BEEN LOYAL TO MARX-
LENINISM-MAO TSE-TUNG THOUGHT. MAYBE YOU HAVE ALSO HEARD OF
THE WORDS OF CHAIRMAN MAO WHEN HE WAS ALIVE AND SPOKEN TO CHAIRMAN
HUA THAT &quot;WITH YOU IN CHARGE, I'M AT EASE.&quot; YOU CAN SEE CHAIRMAN

HUA IS RESOLUTELY CARRYING OUT AND IMPLEMENTING THE POLICIES
FORMULATED BY CHAIRMAN MAO. WITH CHAIRMAN MAO AT EASE, THE
800,000,000 CHINESE PEOPLE ARE EVEN MORE AT EASE BECAUSE THE
SUCCESSOR OF THE REVOLUTIONARY CAUSE WAS SELECTED AND
ARRANGED BY CHAIRMAN MAO WHILE HE WAS ALIVE. AS TO THE GANG OF
FOUR, YOU'VE HEARD OF THEM -- WANG HUNG-WEN, CHANG CHUN-CHIAO,
CHIANG CHING, YAO WEN-YUAN -- THEY CONSTITUTED AN ANTI-PARTY
CLIQUE. THEY FRENZIEDLY OPPOSED CHAIRMAN MAO, OPPOSED HIS THOUGHT,
AND FRANTICALLY OPPOSED THE POLICIES AND LINE FORMULATED FOR US
PERSONALLY BY CHAIRMAN MAO. THEY ENGAGED IN SCHEMING ACTIVITIES A
AND PLOTTED TO USURP PARTY AND STATE POWER. WHEN CHAIRMAN MAO WAS
STILL ALIVE, HE CRITICIZED THEM FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS, TRIED TO
EDUCATE THEM WHEN HE SAW THEN ENGAGING IN REVISIONISM, SPLITTISM,
AND SCHEMING. BECAUSE CHAIRMAN MAO DISCOVERED THIS SCHEME IN
TIMELY FASHION AND ACTED AND EXPOSED THEM THEY WERE UNABLE TO
SUCCEED WHILE CHAIRMAN MAO WAS ALIVE. WHEN CHAIRMAN MAO PASSED
AWAY, THEY AGAIN ENGAGED IN FRENZIED OPPOSITION TO CHAIRMAN HUA,
WHO HAD BEEN SELECTED AS SUCCESSOR TO THE REVOLUTIONARY CAUSE
BY CHAIRMAN MAO WHEN HE WAS ALIVE. THEY PLOTTED TO USURP THE
SUPREME PARTY AND STATE POWER. WHY WERE THEY SO FRENZIEDLY OPPOSED
TO CHAIRMAN HUA? JUST BECAUSE CHAIRMAN HUA RESOLUTELY INHERITED
THE BEHEST OF CHAIRMAN MAO, RESOLUTELY CARRIED OUT THE POLICIES

AND LINE OF CHAIRMAN MAO, AND REMAINS INFINITELY LOYAL TO HIS
THOUGHT. CHAIRMAN HUA HAD BEEN WAGING A RESOLUTE STRUGGLE
AGAINST THEIR SCHEMING ACTIVITIES. ORIGINALLY, CHAIRMAN MAO WANTED
TO SETTLE THE QUESTION OF THE GANG OF FOUR WHILE HE WAS
ALIVE BUT UNFORTUNATELY BEFORE HE COULD DO SO, HE PASSED AWAY.
CHAIRMAN HUA BROUGHT ABOUT THE SOLUTION OF THIS ISSUE WHICH CHAIR-
MAN MAO WISHED TO BUT WAS UNABLE TO BECAUSE OF HIS DEATH. CHAIRMAN
HUA WITH ONE STROKE SMASHED THE PLOT OF THE GANG OF FOUR TO USURP
PARTY AND STATE POWER. IN THIS WAY, UNDER THE LEADERSHIP OF THE
CENTRAL COMMITTEE HEADED BY CHAIRMAN HUA, WE ARE EVEN MORE DETER-
MINED TO CARRY OUT THE LINE AND POLICIES OF CHAIRMAN MAO.

BAYH: DOES THIS MEAN THAT YOU WILL CONTINUE TO FOLLOW THE PRINCIPLES
OF THE SHANGHAI COMMUNIQUE TO MOVE TOWARDS NORMALIZATION?

WANG: OF COURSE. THE LINES AND POLICIES FORMULATED BY CHAIRMAN MAO
ALSO INCLUDE FOREIGN POLICY AND UNDER THE LEADERSHIP OF THE CENTRAL
COMMITTEE HEADED BY CHAIRMAN HUA, WE WILL RESOLUTELY IMPLEMENT
SUCH LINES AND POLICIES. ON THE QUESTION OF NORMALIZATION BETWEEN
OUR TWO COUNTRIES, AS I HAVE OFTEN
STATED TO AMERICAN FRIENDS AND MR. GATES OF THE LIAISON OFFICE
UNDERSTANDS WELL, IF BOTH PARTIES ADHERE TO THE PRINCIPLES OF THE
SHANGHAI COMMUNIQUE RELATIONS BETWEEN THE U.S. AND CHINA CAN BE
IMPROVED. THIS WAS STATED BY PREMIER CHOU IN HIS REPORT TO THE
FOURTH NPC. ON THE QUESTION OF NORMALIZATION BETWEEN OUR TWO
COUNTRIES, WE HAVE THREE PRINCIPLES WHICH WE HAVE TIME AND AGAIN
STATED. I AM SURE YOU ARE FAMILIAR WITH THEM BUT I WOULD LIKE TO
CLEARLY STATE THEM FOR YOU. THE THREE PRINCIPLES ARE: SEVER
DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS BETWEEN THE U.S. AND TAIWAN; WITHDRAWAL OF
AMERICAN TROOPS FROM TAIWAN, AND ABROGATION OF THE SO-CALLED
DEFENSE TREATY WITH TAIWAN. THESE ARE INSEPARABLE AND INDISPEN-
SABLE. THERE CAN BE NO OTHER ALTERNATIVE. ON THE QUESTION OF TAIWAN,
WE DO NOT BELIEVE IN THE SO-CALLED PEACEFUL TRANSITION. CHAIRMAN
TAUGHT US &quot;WHERE THE BROOM DOESN'T REACH, DUST WILL NOT RUN AWAY
BY ITSELF.&quot; IN TAIWAN, THERE IS STILL A BUNCH OF COUNTER-REVO-
LUTIONARIES. OUR STAND ON TAIWAN IS THAT WE BASE OURSELVES ON
A FOOTING TO FIGHT. AS TO WHEN WE WILL LIBERATE TAIWAN AND THE
METHODS WE WILL ADOPT TO LIBERATE TAIWAN, THIS IS PURELY AN
INTERNAL MATTER FOR CHINA AND NO OTHER NATION HAS THE RIGHT TO
INTERFERE WHATSOEVER. SINCE YOU RAISED THIS ISSUE, I HAVE STATED
OUR CONSISTENT STAND VERY CANDIDLY.

BAYH: I APPRECIATE YOUR CANDOR. OUR NATION REMAINS COMMITTED TO
THE SHANGHAI COMMUNIQUE ALTHOUGH WE REALIZE THERE MIGHT BE
SOME DIFFICULTIES. BUT WE ARE DEDICATED TO THIS PURPOSE AND
OUR DISTINGUISHED REPRESENTATIVE AMBASSADOR GATES HAS STRESSED TO
US THE THREE PRINCIPLES WITH THE VICE FOREIGN MINISTER HAS
MENTIONED. ONE LAST THING--
AFTER TALKING WITH OUTSTANDING LEADERS LIKE YOURSELF, AND
MEETING WITH OUR HOSTS WHO ARE OUTSTANDING AMBASSADORS OF GOOD-
WILL, I AM CONVINCED THAT OUR TWO NATIONS HAVE SO MUCH TO OFFER
TO EACH OTHER AND TO THE WORLD. I AM CERTAIN THAT IF OUR TWO
NATIONS ARE INTERESTED IN SOLVING THESE QUESTIONS, WE CAN FIND A
METHOD TO RESOLVE OUR DIFFERENCES.

WANG: BETWEEN FRIENDS, WE CAN HAVE A CANDID EXCHANGE OF
VIEWS. BETWEEN CHINA AND THE U.S. THERE ARE MANY COMMON POINTS ON
MANY ISSUES. THE BIG ISSUE IS THE INTERNATIONAL ONE, TAIWAN IS A
MINOR ISSUE. AMONG THE MANY COMMON
POINTS WE SHARE, THE MOST IMPORTANT IS TO DEAL IN COMMON WITH
OUR NORTHERN SO-CALLED ALLY.

BAYH: WE HAVE A SAYING THAT WITH FRIENDS LIKE THAT WE DON'T
NEED ENEMIES.

CURTIS: WE DO HAVE SOMETHING VERY MUCH IN COMMON -- THE PROTECTION
OF THINGS WE HOLD DEAR AGAINST THE SOVIETS, JUST AS YOU HAVE. THE
FACT THAT YOU EXTENDED AN INVITATION TO US AND THAT WE WERE ABLE
TO ACCEPT IT HAS LED TO BETTER UNDERSTANDING. I COMMEND YOU ON
INVITING US TO VISIT HERE. WE ALSO COMMEND YOU ON YOUR STATEMENT
THAT THE LARGE PICTURE IS WORLD AFFAIRS, AND THE WELFARE OF YOUR
GREAT COUNTRY AND OUR COUNTRY WITH RESPECT TO THE SOVIET UNION.
WE ALSO FEEL THAT WAY. WE ARE PLEASED TO HEAR YOU SAY THAT THE
PROBLEM OF TAIWAN IS SECONDARY TO THESE WORLD PROBLEMS. TAIWAN IS
A PROBLEM FOR US AS WELL AND WE HOPE THAT EVENTUALLY THERE WILL BE
A PEACEFUL SOLUTION.

WANG (SMILING BROADLY): I ALREADY STATED THAT WE DON'T BELIEVE IN
PEACEFUL TRANSITION AND THAT HAS ALWAYS BEEN OUR CONSISTENT STAND.

CURTIS: YOU MUST REALIZE THAT WHEN A NATION SUCH AS OURS FOLLOWS
A COURSE OF CONDUCT FOR DECADES, IT IS DIFFICULT TO CHANGE. JUST
CONFIDENTIAL

PAGE 04        PEKING 02370  03 OF 04  170503Z

AS YOU HAVE PROBLEMS, WE HAVE PROBLEMS.

BAYH: TIME IS ALL TOO SHORT AND ESPECIALLY I'VE ALREADY HAD SOME
TIME TO SPEAK. THIS FIRST VISIT TO CHINA HAS BEEN AN EYE-OPENER.
AS MUCH AS I HAD RESPECTED YOUR COUNTRY AND YOUR PEOPLE, I NOW
RESPECT THEM EVEN MORE. I AM CONVINCED THAT IT IS POSSIBLE FOR
MORE CHINESE TO COME TO THE U.S. I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE A SLIGHT
SUGGESTION. I AM CONVINCED IT CAN RESOLVE SOME PROBLEMS.
RELATIONS COULD BE MORE SUPPORTIVE THROUGH BROADER EXCHANGE
PROGRAMS, MORE TRADE, AND OTHER WAYS OF GETTING TO KNOW ONE ANOTHER
BETTER. EWE'VE HAD THIS OPPORTUNITY BUT THERE ARE ONLY SIX OF US.
IF THERE WERE 600 YOU WOULD HAVE 600 MISSIONARIES GOING BACK.

WANG: SINCE THE DOORS BETWEEN CHINA AND THE US WERE OPENED BY
YOUR FORMER PRESIDENT NIXON, AND BY CHAIRMAN MAO, AND AFTER THE
ISSUANCE OF THE SHANGHAI COMMUNIQUE, THERE HAVE BEEN QUITE A FEW
EXCHANGES BETWEEN CHINA AND THE U.S.

CURTIS: YOU HAVE BEEN A MOST GRACIOUS HOSTESS. BEFORE WE END, I
WONDER IF MY COLLEAGUES HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY.

YOUNG: WE DEEPLY APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO COME TO KNOW YOU
BETTER. WE WILL KNOW YOU MORE IN THE FUTURE. THE U.S. IS SPREAD
THINLY OVER THE WORLD BUT WE ARE BOUND NOT BECOME SECOND TO THE
SOVIET UNION. STILL, THERE ARE PROBLEMS -- THE PHILIPPINES WANT US
TO REMOVE OUR BASES. WE HAVE PROBLEMS ALL OVER THE WORLD AND THAT'S
WHY WE NEED FRIENDS LIKE YOU.

HOLLINGS: I TOO AM VERY GRATEFUL FOR YOUR HOSPITALITY AND AS
SENATOR BAYH HAS POINTED OUT, THIS VISIT HAS BEEN AN EYE OPENER.
CHINA HAS A BIG PART OF THE WORLD'S POPULATION AND THE U.S.
AND CHINA SHOULD BE WORKING TOGETHER FOR PEACE IN THE FUTURE.
I THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO MEET
YOU THIS AFTERNOON.

STEVENS: I THANK YOU TOO. THIS HAS BEEN A VERY ENJOYABLE TIME AND
IT IS MOST MEMORABLE FOR ME TO COME BACK AGAIN. I WOULD LIKE AT
CONFIDENTIAL

CONFIDENTIAL

PAGE 02        PEKING 02370  04 OF 04  170255Z

SOME TIME TO EXPLORE WHY WE CANNOT HAVE SOME OF THE STEPS THAT LEAD
TOWARDS NORMALIZATION PRIOR TO THE REALIZATION OF THE PRINCIPLES
YOU HAVE MENTIONED, SUCH AS AIR ROUTES, EXPANSION OF EXCHANGES.
I THINK, AND IT MAY BE IMPORTANT, SOMETIMES I'M NOT SURE YOU ARE
FULLY COGNIZANT OF THE DIFFICULTIES WE FACE, AND INCREASED
EXCHANGES WOULD HELP YOU BECOME AWARE OF THESE PROBLEMS.

JOHNSTON: MADAME VICE FOREIGN MINISTER, I WOULD LIKE TO ADD MY
GRATITUDE TO THAT OF MY COLLEAGUES. ONE QUESTION OF SUBSTANCE IS
RELATED TO KOREA. IN THE COMING SESSION OF CONGRESS IN JANUARY,
SOME COLLEAGUES WILL BE CALLING FOR THE WITHDRAWAL OF TROOPS
THERE. MAY WE REPORT TO OUR COLLEAGUES THAT THE RETENTION OF TROOPS
AND THE TREATY WITH KOREA WILL NOT BE A MAJOR STUMBLING BLOCK IN
IMPLEMENTING THE SHANGHAI COMMUNIQUE OR A BLOCK TO THE IMPROVEMENT
OF OUR RELATIONS?

WANG: ON KOREA, OUR STAND IS CONSISTENT. WE SUPPORT THE
STAND OF THE DPRK ON INDEPENDENT AND PEACEFUL REUNIFICATION OF
KOREA AND THAT ALL US TROOPS SHOULD BE WITHDRAWN AND THE UNC
DISBANDED. THE ISSUE OF KOREA
SHOULD BE LEFT TO THE KOREAN PEOPLE THEMSELVES TO SETTLE.
THIS HAS BEEN OUR PRINCIPLED STAND.

CURTIS: AMBASSADOR GATES, DO YOU HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY?

GATES: WE'RE OLD FRIENDS.

WANG: I WELCOME YOUR COMING HERE AND THE EXCHANGE OF VIEWS. THEY
WILL HELP PROMOTE MUTUAL UNDERSTANDING BETWEEN US.

CURTIS: WE BELIEVE MUCH AS BEEN GAINED. YOU ARE A CHARMING
HOSTESS.

WANG: OUR EXCHANGE OF VIEWS AND DISCUSSION WILL HELP UNDERSTANDING
BUT WHEN YOU LEAVE PEKING AND VISIT OTHER PARTS OF OUR COUNTRY
YOU WILL UNDERSTAND MORE WHAT HAPPENS IN OUR COUNTTRY. YOU CAN
WITNESS FOR YOURSELF HOW THE PEOPLE BRING THEIR INITIATIVE INTO
FULL PLAY AND RELY ON THEIR OWN EFFORTS TO BRING ABOUT SOCIAL-
IST REVOLUTION AND CONSTRUCTION OF OUR COUNTRY.

CURTIS: WE HAVE ALREADY WITNESSED SOME OF THAT. BEFORE WE DEPART,

PAGE 03        PEKING 02370  04 OF 04  170255Z

I WOULD LIKE TO SAY THAT FORMER PRESIDENT NIXON ASKED ME TO EXTEND
HIS WARMEST GREETINGS.

WANG: I WILL CONVEY THAT TO OUR LEADERS. THANK YOU FOR COMING
TO VISIT US.

(AFTER THE SESSION HAD ENDED, WANG CAME UP TO SENATOR CURTIS TO
SAY THAT THE CONVERSATION HAD BEEN FRANK AND WAS NOT FOR
PUBLICATION.)
