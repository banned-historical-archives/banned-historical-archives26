		<h3>Tor</h3>
		<p><a href="https://www.torproject.org">Tor</a> is an encrypted anonymising network that makes it harder to intercept internet communications, or see where communications are coming from or going to.</p>
		<p>In order to use the WikiLeaks public submission system as detailed above you can download the Tor Browser Bundle, which is a Firefox-like browser available for Windows, Mac OS X and GNU/Linux and pre-configured to connect using the anonymising system Tor.</p>
		<h4>Tails</h4>
		<p>If you are at high risk and you have the capacity to do so, you can also access the submission system through a secure operating system called <a href="https://tails.boum.org">Tails</a>. Tails is an operating system launched from a USB stick or a DVD that aim to leaves no traces when the computer is shut down after use and automatically routes your internet traffic through Tor. Tails will require you to have either a USB stick or a DVD at least 4GB big and a laptop or desktop computer.</p>

		<h3>Tips</h3>
		<p>Our submission system works hard to preserve your anonymity, but we recommend you also take some of your own precautions. Please review these basic guidelines. </p>
		<div>
			<h4>1. Contact us if you have specific problems</h4>
			<p>If you have a very large submission, or a submission with a complex format, or are a high-risk source, please <a href="#submit_help_contact">contact us</a>. In our experience it is always possible to find a custom solution for even the most seemingly difficult situations.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h4>2. What computer to use</h4>
			<p>If the computer you are uploading from could subsequently be audited in an investigation, consider using a computer that is not easily tied to you. Technical users can also use <a href="https://tails.boum.org">Tails</a> to help ensure you do not leave any records of your submission on the computer.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h4>3. Do not talk about your submission to others</h4>
			<p>If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in source protection – it is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This includes other media organisations.</p>
		</div>

	</div>

		<h3>After</h3>

		<div>
			<h4>1. Do not talk about your submission to others</h4>
			<p>If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in source protection – it is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This includes other media organisations.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h4>2. Act normal</h4>
			<p>If you are a high-risk source, avoid saying anything or doing anything after submitting which might promote suspicion. In particular, you should try to stick to your normal routine and behaviour.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h4>3. Remove traces of your submission</h4>
			<p>If you are a high-risk source and the computer you prepared your submission on, or uploaded it from, could subsequently be audited in an investigation, we recommend that you format and dispose of the computer hard drive and any other storage media you used.</p>
			<p>In particular, hard drives retain data after formatting which may be visible to a digital forensics team and flash media (USB sticks, memory cards and SSD drives) retain data even after a secure erasure. If you used flash media to store sensitive data, it is important to destroy the media.</p>
			<p>If you do this and are a high-risk source you should make sure there are no traces of the clean-up, since such traces themselves may draw suspicion.</p>
			<div>
				<h4>4. If you face legal action</h4>
				<p>If a legal action is brought against you as a result of your submission, there are organisations that may help you. The Courage Foundation is an international organisation dedicated to the protection of journalistic sources. You can find more details at <a href="https://www.couragefound.org">https://www.couragefound.org</a>.</p>

		<p>WikiLeaks publishes documents of political or historical importance that are censored or otherwise suppressed. We specialise in strategic global publishing and large archives.</p>
		<p>The following is the address of our secure site where you can anonymously upload your documents to WikiLeaks editors. You can only access this submissions system through Tor. (See our <a href="#submit_help_tor">Tor tab</a> for more information.) We also advise you to read our <a href="#submit_help_tips">tips for sources</a> before submitting.</p>

			<!--<div>
				Copy this address into your Tor browser. Advanced users, if they wish, can also add a further layer of encryption to their submission using <a href="#submit_wlkey">our public PGP key</a>.
			</div>-->
		</div>

		<p>If you cannot use Tor, or your submission is very large, or you have specific requirements, WikiLeaks provides several alternative methods. <a href="#submit_help_contact">Contact us</a> to discuss how to proceed.</p>

ASIAN DEVELOPMENTS IN 1979 HAVE BEEN DOMINATED BY THE
CONFLICT GROWING OUT OF COMPETING AMBITIONS AMONG THE
COMMUNIST POWERS IN SOUTHEAST ASIA, AND THE TRAGIC AND
DESTABILIZING EFFECTS OF THE FIGHTING AND THE REFUGEE

FLOW. THERE ARE NO SIGNS THAT CHINA HAS IMMINENT PLANS
TO &quot;TEACH VIETNAM A SECOND LESSON.&quot; RATHER THE PROSPECT
IS FOR A PROTRACTED STRUGGLE WITH CHINA APPLYING A MIX
OF PSYCHOLOGICAL AND GUERRILLA WARFARE PRESSURES ON THE
SRV ALONG THE SINO-INDOCHINA BORDER AND WITH PRC SUPPORTED POL POT AND LAO GUERRILLA FORCES MAINTAINING RESISTENCE IN KAMPUCHEA AND LAOS. THE PRC HOPES
THROUGH THESE TACTICS TO WEAR THE VIETNAMESE DOWN, TO
DISCOURAGE THEM FROM REALIZING THEIR AMBITIONS AND TO
ENHANCE ITS OWN ROLE IN THE AREA WHILE STALLING SOVIET
PENETRATION EFFORTS. ALTHOUGH ITS RESOURCES ARE
STRETCHED, WE EXPECT VIETNAM, WITH MAJOR SECURITY AND
ECONOMIC ASSISTANCE FROM THE SOVIET UNION TO KEEP UP
ITS RELENTLESS PURSUIT OF DOMINATION OVER INDOCHINA AND
THE LEADING ROLE IN SOUTHEAST ASIA. THUS, THE OUTLOOK
FOR ANY KIND OF POLITICAL SETTLEMENT IN KAMPUCHEA IN
THE NEAR FUTURE IS ALMOST NIL.
AN ENCOURAGING ASPECT OF SOUTHEAST ASIAN DEVELOPMENTS HAS BEEN THE INCREASING UNITY OF THE ASEAN
NATIONS IN FACE OF THE LATEST INDOCHINA CONVULSION.
WHILE MAINTAINING A STEADY COURSE TOWARD THEIR PRIME

GOAL OF STRENGTH AND STABILITY THROUGH ECONOMIC AND
SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT, THE ASEANS HAVE TAKEN A LEAD IN
STRONG JOINT STATEMENTS AND UN EFFORTS AGAINST VIETNAMESE ACTIONS, HAVE THUS FAR SUCCESSFULLY HANDLED
THE POLITICALLY DEVISIVE ASPECTS OF THE REFUGEE
PROBLEM,HAVE MODESTLY STEPPED UP THEIR
INDIVIDUAL SECURITY EFFORTS, AS WELL AS BILATERAL
AND TRILATERAL SECURITY COOPERATION,
AND MOST RECENTLY TURNED DOWN SOVIET REQUESTS FOR
NAVAL VISITS AT ASEAN PORTS. WITH A SUBSTANTIAL
ASSIST FROM THE EUROPEAN NATIONS, THE UNITED STATES
AND OTHERS, THE ASEAN NATIONS WON RELIEF

TORIUM ON THE OFFICIALLY SPONSORED EXODUS. THEY ALSO
WON AN IMPORTANT UNITED NATIONS VICTORY WHEN A LARGE
UNGA MAJORITY VOTED TO SEAT POL POT'S REPRESENTATIVES.
ASEAN IS NOT WITHOUT ITS PROBLEMS, HOWEVER. THE POSSIBILITY OF SPILLOVER OF THE INDOCHINA FIGHTING, THE
GROWING USSR/SRV RELATIONSHIP, INVOLVING INCREASED
SOVIET MILITARY PRESENCE IN VIETNAM, PLUS THE SPECTRE
OF A RENEWED DELUGE OF REFUGEES ALL WERE MATTERS OF
CONCERN. OIL PRICE INCREASES AND INFLATION ALSO ARE
AFFECTING ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND IN THE PHILIPPINES
ARE CONTRIBUTING TO DOMESTIC POLITICAL UNREST. ACCORDINGLY, WHILE THEIR OWN GROWTH AND UNIFYING EFFORTS
HAVE BEEN ENCOURAGING, THE ASEAN NATIONS CONTINUE TO
NEED AND SEEK SUPPORT FROM THE INDUSTRIALIZED NATIONS
IN A VARIETY OF AREAS.
IN CONTRAST TO THE DESTABILIZING TRENDS AMONG THE
COMMUNIST NATIONS IN SOUTHEAST ASIA, DEVELOPMENTS IN
NORTHEAST ASIA HAVE FOR THE MOST PART BEEN CONSTRUCTIVE. SUCCESSFUL NORMALIZATION OF US/PRC RELATIONS
HAS BEEN ACCOMPLISHED AT THE SAME TIME THE PRC HAS
MOVED DRAMATICALLY TOWARD A MORE PRAGMATIC AND OPEN
APPROACH TO BOTH ITS DOMESTIC DEVELOPMENT AND FOREIGN
POLICIES. THE SINO-JAPANESE PFT ADDS SUBSTANTIALLY
TO THE ENCOURAGING STRATEGIC TRENDS IN THE AREA.
OTHER MAJOR POSITIVE DEVELOPMENTS INCLUDE RESOLUTION
OF ECONOMIC DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND
JAPAN, THE ENLARGING WORLD POLITICAL ROLE BEING PLAYED
BY JAPAN AND RESOLUTION OF SECURITY AND POLITICAL ISSUES
BETWEEN THE US AND KOREA -- ALTHOUGH EARLY OCTOBER
POLITICAL DEVELOPMENTS IN SEOUL WERE REGRETTED IN
WASHINGTON. WHILE DYNAMIC GROWTH CONTINUES IN JAPAN

AND KOREA, INFLATION ADDS TO DOMESTIC POLITICAL CONCERNS IN THE ROK.
SOVIET AND NORTH KOREAN RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE REST OF
THE AREA ON THE OTHER HAND FAILED TO IMPROVE AND
PROSPECTS ARE NOT ENCOURAGING. THE NORTH KOREANS
REBUFFED A US/ROK OFFER OF TRIPARTITE TALKS, AND
WE SEE NO OPPORTUNITY AT THIS TIME TO BEGIN TO
RESOLVE THE DEEP NORTH/SOUTH KOREAN DIFFICULTIES.
THE SOVIET MILITARY BUILD-UP ON THE ISLANDS NORTH
OF HOKKAIDO CLAIMED BY JAPAN EXACERBATED THE COOL
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THESE TWO POWERS.
II. THE SITUATION IN THE INDOCHINESE PENINSULA
COMMITTED TO MILITARY SOLUTIONS WHEN NECESSARY TO
ACHIEVE ITS OBJECTIVES, HANOI INTENDS TO CONSOLIDATE
ITS DOMINANCE OVER INDOCHINA, STRENGTHEN ITS POSITION
VIS-A-VIS THE PRC AND EVENTUALLY BECOME THE DOMINANT
POWER IN SOUTHEAST ASIA. CHINA ON THE OTHER HAND, INTENDS TO EXERT SUSTAINED MILITARY AND PSYCHOLOGICAL
PRESSURE ON HANOI, TO COMPEL IT -- OVER SEVERAL YEARS
-- TO SHOW GREATER RESPECT FOR CHINESE POWER AND INTERESTS IN SOUTHEAST ASIA AND WEAKEN ITS TIES WITH MOSCOW.
AS A CONSEQUENCE, WHILE THE TWO CONTINUE TO HOLD TALKS,
THEIR OPPOSED AMBITIONS WILL CONTINUE TO GENERATE TENSION AND CONFRONTATION ALONG THE SINO-VIETNAMESE BORDER
AND IN KAMPUCHEA AND LAOS.
SINO-VIETNAMESE RELATIONS
CHINA AND VIETNAM REMAIN DEADLOCKED AFTER THEIR 12TH
NEGOTIATING SESSION IN BEIJING, AND NO PROGRESS SEEMS
LIKELY. DURING RECENT SESSIONS CHINA REPEATED ITS POSITION THAT THE ONLY LEGITIMATE KAMPUCHEAN GOVERNMENT IS
THE ONE HEADED BY POL POT. THE CHINESE ALSO PROMISED
SECRET
SECRET
PAGE 06

STATE 263929

TO AID THE ANTI-VIETNAMESE RESISTANCE IN KAMPUCHEA AS
LONG AS VIETNAM KEEPS ITS TROOPS THERE. THE CHINESE
HOLD OUT NO HOPE FOR BETTER RELATIONS WITH HANOI UNTIL
THE VIETNAMESE CEASE THEIR HOSTILE POLICIES TOWARD
CHINA, WITHDRAW FROM BOTH KAMPUCHEA AND LAOS, AND STOP
ARMED PROVOCATIONS ALONG THE BORDER. WHEREAS CHINA'S
STANCE IS BASED ON A BROAD INDICTMENT OF VIETNAM'S QUEST

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
FOR HEGEMONY IN INDOCHINA, VIETNAM'S POSITION IS THAT
SPECIFIC BILATERAL ISSUES, I.E., CESSATION OF BORDER PROVOCATIONS THROUGH CREATION OF A DEMILITARIZED ZONE,
SHOULD BE NEGOTIATED. VIETNAM REFUSES TO DISCUSS THE
SITUATION IN KAMPUCHEA AND LAOS, ARGUING THAT CHANGES
THAT OCCURRED EARLIER THIS YEAR IN KAMPUCHEA ARE &quot;IRREVERSIBLE.&quot; THE VIETNAMESE HAVE ALSO ACCUSED THE CHINESE
OF MASSING TROOPS ALONG THE BORDERS WITH VIETNAM AND
LAOS WHERE DAILY CHINESE &quot;INCURSIONS&quot; ARE SAID TO BE
CREATING AN &quot;INCREASINGLY TENSE&quot; SITUATION. NEITHER
SIDE HAS HINTED SO FAR THAT THE TALKS MAY BE CALLED OFF.
WE BELIEVE THAT ARMED PROVOCATIONS ARE OCCURRING ON
THE SINO-VIETNAMESE BORDER, PROBABLY FROM BOTH SIDES,
BUT CANNOT CONFIRM THE NUMBER AND SEVERITY AS ALLEGED
BY THE CHINESE AND VIETNAMESE MEDIA. FIVE PROTEST
NOTES BY THE CHINESE AND VIETNAMESE FOREIGN MINISTERIES
WERE EXCHANGED DURING JULY, BUT ONLY THE CHINESE LODGED
A PROTEST DURING AUGUST.
DESPITE THE WITHDRAWAL OF A LARGE NUMBER OF CHINESE
TROOPS AND AIRCRAFT FROM THE BORDER AREA, TENSION BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES CONTINUED TO BE IN EVIDENCE
THROUGHOUT THE SUMMER, AND THE CHINESE HAVE RECENTLY
STRENGTHENED THEIR DEFENSE UNITS ALONG THE BORDER.
ALTHOUGH NONE OF THESE RECENT DEVELOPMENTS INDICATE THAT

WITH ITS SECURITY ON THE CHINESE BORDER, AND HAS TAKEN
STEPS TO IMPROVE ITS MILITARY CAPABILITIES IN THE NORTHERN PART OF THE COUNTRY.
-- ROUGHLY 130,000-160,000 CHINESE TROOPS REMAIN POSITIONED ALONG THE SINO-VIETNAMESE BORDER. THUS FAR, WE
HAVE DETECTED NO MAJOR MOVEMENT OF CHINESE FORCES TOWARD
THE BORDER.
-- CHINESE AIR STRENGTH AT THE EIGHT BORDER AIRFIELDS
IS IN EXCESS OF 300 AIRCRAFT. THIS COMPARES WITH THE
NEARLY 900 FIGHTERS BASED AT THESE AIRFIELDS DURING THE
CONFLICT.
-- THERE HAS BEEN AN INCREASE IN CHINESE NAVAL SECURITY
ON HAINAN ISLAND AND IN THE PARACELS.
-- IN FEBRUARY VIETNAM HAD MORE THAN A DOZEN INFANTRY
AND ECONOMIC CONSTRUCTION DIVISIONS DEPLOYED IN THE RED
RIVER DELTA OF NORTHERN VIETNAM AND NEAR THE BORDER
WITH CHINA. FOLLOWING THE MARCH 1979 MOBILIZATION DE-

CREE, THREE NEW ARMY CORPS WERE FORMED IN THE NORTH AND
OTHER UNITS WERE DEPLOYED THERE. TODAY THERE ARE AT
LEAST 10 INFANTRY DIVISIONS IN NORTHERN VIETNAM AND MAYBE AS MANY AS 19, IN ADDITION TO FIVE ECONOMIC CONSTRUCTION DIVISIONS, AIR DEFENSE REGIMENTS, AND NUMEROUS
SUPPORT AND REGIONAL FORCES. OUR CURRENT ESTIMATE IS
THAT FROM THE HANOI AREA NORTH TO THE BORDER, TOTAL
VIETNAMESE GROUND FORCES RANGE FROM 225,000 TO 285,000
TROOPS. AT THE TIME OF THE CHINESE ATTACK, VIETNAMESE
GROUND STRENGTH WAS PROBABLY NO GREATER THAN 150,000.
-- VIETNAM HAS INCREASED ITS TACTICAL AIR STRENGTH IN
THE NORTH SINCE FEBRUARY. AT THE ONSET OF THE CHINESE
INVASION, THERE WERE SLIGHTLY MORE THAN 130 FIGHTERS AT

NORTHERN AIRFIELDS. CURRENTLY THERE ARE MORE THAN 150
COMBAT AIRCRAFT THERE.
-- VIETNAM HAS PLACED CONSIDERABLE EMPHASIS ON STRENGTHENING ITS DEFENSE IN THE NORTHEAST COASTAL REGION, ESPECIALLY QUANG NINH PROVINCE. LARGE NUMBERS OF MILITARY PERSONNEL, ARMORED VEHICLES AND ARTILLERY HAVE
BEEN DEPLOYED THERE. ACCORDING TO SOME UNCONFIRMED
REPORTS, THE VIETNAMESE HAD EMPLACED SOVIET-PROVIDED
SCUD SURFACE-TO-SURFACE MISSILES IN THE CAM PHA-HON
GAI AREA. THIS IS A LIQUID-PROPELLED AREA WEAPON
WITH A RANGE OF 300 KILOMETERS AND A CONVENTIONAL
PAYLOAD OF 1,000 KILOGRAMS. QUANG NINH PROVINCE,
THE ONLY NORTHERN PROVINCE TO ESCAPE CHINA'S FEBRUARY
ATTACKS, CONCERNS THE VIETNAMESE BECAUSE ITS RICH COAL
MINES WOULD MAKE A LUCRATIVE TARGET FOR A CHINESE SECOND
STRIKE.
THE SOVIETS HAVE SUPPLIED VIETNAM IN 1979 WITH SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNTS OF MILITARY HARDWARE, ALTHOUGH IT HAS BEEN
ESSENTIALLY MORE OF THE SAME WEAPONS ALREADY IN VIETNAMESE INVENTORIES. WEAPON DELIVERIES HAVE INCLUDED TR54/44 TANKS, MIG-21'S (SOME DESTINED FOR LAOS) FIELD
ARTILLERY PIECES, SA-2 SURFACE-TO-AIR MISSILES, AND
LARGE AMOUNTS OF FUEL, LUBRICANTS, AND AMMUNITION. VIETNAM'S NAVY HAS BEEN AUGMENTED BY A PAIR OF LIGHT FRIGATES
AND SOME PATROL BOATS. NUMEROUS MILITARY TRUCKS AND
TRAILERS HAVE BEEN PROVIDED AS WELL AS GENERAL PURPOSE
TRANSPORT HELICOPTERS.
SOVIET ACTIVITY IN VIETNAM DURING 1979 INCREASED AS WELL.

TED THE SOVIET NAVY TO USE ITS FACILITIES AT DA NANG AND
CAM RANH TO TEMPORARILY DEPLOY SOVIET COMBATANT VESSELS
AND LONG-RANGE RECONAISSANCE AIRCRAFT. SOVIET CREWS AND
AIRCRAFT ARE ALSO FLYING DAILY TRANSPORT MISSIONS FROM
VIETNAMESE AIR BASES TO LAOS AND KAMPUCHEA. NEVERTHELESS,
THE 3,000-5,000 MAN SOVIET ADVISORY PRESENCE IN VIETNAM
HAS NOT BEEN APPRECIABLY AUGMENTED AND THE SOVIETS DO NOT
APPEAR TO HAVE GAINED PERMANENT BASE RIGHTS.
DESPITE VIETNAMESE FEARS AND PROPAGANDA, THERE ARE NO INDICATIONS THAT A MAJOR CHINESE ATTACK IS IMMINENT. STATEMENTS ON THE SUBJECT, AS REPORTED IN THE MEDIA OR OBTAINED
THROUGH CLANDESTINE SOURCES, ARE AMBIGUOUS, ALTHOUGH THE
CHINESE CONTINUE TO WARN THAT THEY MAINTAIN THE RIGHT TO
TEACH VIETNAM A SECOND LESSON. MOST OF THE INDICATORS
WHICH APPEARED PRIOR TO CHINA'S FEBRUARY INVASION HAVE
YET TO BE REFLECTED. MAJOR AIR DEPLOYMENTS WHICH BEGAN
UP TO SIX WEEKS BEFORE THE INVASION HAVE NOT REOCCURRED.
CIVILIAN EVACUATIONS, TROOP RECALLS AND LEAVE CANCELLATIONS, ALERT POSTURES ALONG THE SINO-SOVIET BORDER, HAVE
ALL FAILED TO APPEAR THUS FAR. MOREOVER, IN THE BORDER
AREA VIETNAM IS DEFINITELY BETTER PREPARED FOR CONFLICT
WITH THE CHINESE THAN IT WAS EARLY LAST FEBRUARY, SO WE
ASSUME ANOTHER MAJOR ATTACK SIMILAR TO LAST FEBRUARY'S
WOULD REQUIRE A GREATER CHINESE BUILDUP THAN LAST FEBRUARY.
THE SITUATION IN KAMPUCHEA
THE MILITARY CONFRONTATION IN KAMPUCHEA HAS BEEN RELATIVELY SUBDUED DURING THE RAINY SEASON. HOWEVER, IN MIDSEPTEMBER, VIETNAMESE FORCES IN CENTRAL KAMPUCHEA LAUNCHED WHAT IS EXPECTED TO BECOME A NATIONWIDE MILITARY OFFENSIVE AIMED AT ELIMINATING POL POT FORCES AND OTHER KHMER
RESISTANCE ELEMENTS. THE VIETNAMESE ATTEMPT TO CONSOLIDATE CONTROL OF KAMPUCHEA HAS BEEN FRUSTRATED BY THE

APPROXIMATELY 30,000 ARMED POL POT TROOPS PLUS OTHER
RESISTANCE FORCES SUCH AS THE KHMER LIBERATION MOVEMENT
(KLM). THE VIETNAMESE OFFENSIVE IS EXPECTED TO GENERATE
GREAT REFUGEE PRESSURE ON THAILAND WITH AS MANY AS 200,000
KHMER CIVILIANS ULTIMATELY ATTEMPTING TO FLEE TO THAI
TERRITORY TO ESCAPE FAMINE AND RENEWED CONFLICT.

THE RENEWED FIGHTING AGAIN RAISES THE PROSPECT OF A SPILLOVER OF THE FIGHTING INTO THAI TERRITORY EITHER INADVERTENTLY OR DELIBERATELY IN THE FORM OF &quot;HOT PURSUIT&quot;
RAIDS TARGETED ON RETREATING POL POT FORCES. THE NEW
OFFENSIVE IS LIKELY TO JEOPARDIZE INTERNATIONAL HUMANITARIAN RELIEF EFFORTS NOW GETTING UNDERWAY IN THE PRK
ZONE AS WELL AS DISRUPT BORDER FEEDING OPERATIONS AND
RELIEF OPERATIONS IN THE DK ZONE.
ICRC/UNICEF IS MOVING TOWARD FULL IMPLEMENTATION OF INTERNATIONAL RELIEF PROGRAM UNDER THEIR COORDINATION.
THE PROGRAM WILL RESPOND TO FAMINE-GENERATED NEEDS AMONG
THE KHMER THROUGH RELIEF OPERATIONS IN BOTH THE VIETNAMESE AND RESISTANCE CONTROLLED ZONES. IMPLEMENTATION
OF THE PROGRAMS FOLLOWS UPON PRK PERMISSION TO ICRC AND
UNICEF TO OPEN OFFICES IN PHNOM PENH AND DK WILLINGNESS
TO PERMIT INTERNATIONAL MONITORING OF RELIEF OPERATIONS
IN THE DK ZONE.
150,000-200,000 VIETNAMESE SOLDIERS ARE PRESENTLY
OCCUPYING KAMPUCHEA AND ATTEMPTING TO ERADICATE DEMOCRATIC KAMPUCHEA (DK) FORCES LOYAL TO POL POT. VIETNAMESE

RECRUIT AND TRAIN A CORPS OF ETHNIC KHMER CIVILIAN AND
MILITARY OFFICIALS. THE BULK OF THE POPULATION -- POSSIBLY AS MANY AS FOUR MILLION PEOPLE--IS UNDER THE CONTROL

OF THE VIETNAMESE-BACKED HENG SAMRIN REGIME (THE PEOPLE'S
REPUBLIC OF KAMPUCHEA - PRK).
DK FORCES PROBABLY NUMBER SOME 30,000, BUT WE ARE NOT CERTAIN HOW MANY CIVILIANS THEY CONTROL. ALTHOUGH DK UNITS
CONTINUE TO CONDUCT GUERRILLA OPERATIONS IN THE WESTERN,
CENTRAL, NORTHERN AND NORTHEASTERN REGIONS OF THE COUNTRY,
POL POT'S BASE IS IN THE CARDAMON MOUNTAINS, ABOUT 30 KILOMETERS SOUTHEAST OF PAILIN NEAR THE THAI BORDER.
ALONG WITH POLITICAL SUPPORT, BEIJING CONTINUES TO PROVIDE
MATERIAL SUPPORT TO THE POL POT FORCES TO THE LIMITED EXTENT POSSIBLE. ALTHOUGH THEY CAN APPLY PRESSURE ON THE
VIETNAMESE ELSEWHERE, KEEPING THEM OFF BALANCE AND RAISING THE MORALE OF KAMPUCHEA RESISTANCE FORCES, THE CHINESE
RECOGNIZE THAT AT THIS POINT THEY CAN EXERT ONLY LIMITED
DIRECT INFLUENCE ON THE OUTCOME IN KAMPUCHEA. HOWEVER,
THE CHINESE SEE SURVIVAL OF DK FORCES AS THE MOST IMPORTANT
ELEMENT IN THEIR STRATEGY TO DRAIN SRV RESOURCES AND FORCE
HANOI TO CHANGE ITS COURSE.
THE HENG SAMRIN REGIME (PRK) CONSISTS OF A SMALL GROUP

OF PRO-HANOI KHMERS PROVIDING THE FACADE OF AN INDEPENDENT

NUMBERS OF QUALIFIED KHMER PERSONNEL HAVE PROVEN UNSUCCESSFUL THUS FAR. MOST ADMINISTRATIVE FUNCTIONS ARE PERFORMED
BY THE VIETNAMESE, AND RESENTMENT TO VIETNAMESE OCCUPATION
IS GROWING. HENG SAMRIN TROOPS ARE CONSIDERED SUSPECT BY
SRV AND SEVERAL UNITS HAVE REPORTEDLY DEFECTED TO KHMER

REPOPULATED, THERE IS VERY LITTLE INDUSTRY, AND FEW
SCHOOLS, HOSPITALS AND OTHER FACILITIES ARE FUNCTIONING.

KHMER RESISTANCE FORCES, BOTH INSIDE THE COUNTRY AND
ABROAD, ARE ATTEMPTING TO FORM A UNITED FRONT TO DEFEAT
THE VIETNAMESE OCCUPYING FORCES. THE DK RECENTLY ORDERED
ITS FORCES TO UNITE WITH THE ANTI-COMMUNIST KHMER LIBERATION MOVEMENT (KLM) AND OTHER GROUPS TO FIGHT THE VIETNAMESE, DECLARING THAT DIFFERENCES ARE TO BE RESOLVED
THROUGH CONFERENCES, AND LATER THERE WILL BE &quot;UNIVERSAL,
FREE, AND SECRET ELECTIONS&quot; UNDER INTERNATIONAL SUPERVISION. ON SEPTEMBER 6, BOTH CHINESE AND POL POT-CONTROLLED RADIOS ANNOUNCED A DRAFT POLITICAL PROGRAM FOR
THE &quot;PATRIOTIC AND DEMOCRATIC FRONT OF THE GREAT NATIONAL
UNION OF KAMPUCHEA.&quot; THE DRAFT, WHICH MAKES NO MENTION
OF THE POL POT REGIME, IS CLEARLY INSPIRED BY THE CHINESE
AND IS INTENDED TO ATTRACT WIDER SUPPORT. SON SANN,
LEADER OF THE KLM, HAS SO FAR REFUSED TO SUPPORT THE
NEW FRONT. THE KLM, ALREADY COOPERATING IN AN UNEASY
MILITARY ALLIANCE WITH THE DK SINCE EARLY MAY, HAS
FIELDED SEVERAL BATTALIONS AND IS NOW TAKING AN ACTIVE
PART IN COMBAT OPERATIONS AGAINST THE VIETNAMESE.
PRINCE NORODOM SIHANOUK, CURRENTLY IN NORTH KOREA, HAS
REFUSED CHINESE REQUESTS TO COOPERATE WITH THE DK.
ALTHOUGH STILL A VERY POPULAR KHMER PATRIOT AND LEADER,
SIHANOUK RUNS THE RISK OF ISOLATING HIMSELF; THE CHINESE
BELIEVE THE REAL CONTEST IS BEING WAGED ON THE GROUND,
WHERE DK FORCES ARE PUTTING UP THE ONLY CREDIBLE RESISTANCE TO THE VIETNAMESE.

CREATE AN INDIGENOUS ADMINISTRATION OF PRO-HANOI KHMERS
ARE BOGGED DOWN. HOWEVER, THE SRV REMAINS FULLY DETERMINED TO RETAIN DOMINANCE OVER KAMPUCHEA AND DK AND KLM
FORCES ARE NOT ABLE TO EXPEL THE VIETNAMESE. VIETNAM IS
UNLIKELY TO PULL OUT ANY OF ITS FORCES OR AGREE TO NEGOTIATIONS ON THE NEUTRALIZATION OF KAMPUCHEA WHILE IT
BELIEVES IT HAS THE CAPABILITY TO DESTROY DK FORCES.
THE PRC IS ADAMANTLY OPPOSED TO ANY SOLUTION SHORT OF

REMAIN THE VICTIM OF NEARLY A DECADE OF WAR AND SLAUGHTER.
THE SITUATION IN LAOS
AS A RESULT OF THE SINO-VIETNAMESE CONFLICT, IN EARLY
APRIL 1979 THE LAO GOVERNMENT PUBLICLY ACCUSED THE CHINESE OF BORDER PROVOCATIONS AND ORDERED A COUNTRYWIDE
MOBILIZATION OF MILITARY AND POLICE FORCES. IN ADDITION,
THE LAO HAVE TAKEN MEASURES TO INCREASE THEIR READINESS
POSTURE AND REINFORCE THEIR FORCES ALONG THE BORDER.
TROOPS HAVE BEEN AIRLIFTED TO THE BORDER AND ADDITIONAL
ARMOR AND ARTILLERY ARE BEING DEPLOYED THERE. MORE SOVIET-MADE MIG AIRCRAFT HAVE BEEN TRANSFERRED FROM VIETNAM
TO LAOS. A NEW COMBAT ZONE ENCOMPASSING THREE PROVINCES
-- LUANG NAMTHA, OUDOMSAI, AND PHONG SALY -- ALL OF WHICH
BORDER ON CHINA'S YUNNAN PROVINCE, HAS BEEN CREATED IN AN
ATTEMPT TO IMPROVE COMMAND AND CONTROL OF LAO FORCES IN
THAT REGION.
NEARLY 40,000 VIETNAMESE TROOPS IN LAOS ARE INVOLVED
IN CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITIES AND SUPPRESSION OF ANTICOMMUNIST RESISTANCE ELEMENTS. THERE ARE SOME INDICANORTHERN LAOS. SINCE SPRING OF THIS YEAR, VIETNAMESE
AND SOVIET AIRCRAFT HAVE CONDUCTED NUMEROUS RESUPPLY

HAS RECENTLY AUGMENTED ITS BORDER DEFENSE REGIMENTS, AND
MAINTAINS A REGULAR FORCE DIVISION SOME 80 KILOMETERS
NORTH OF THE BORDER. CHINA HAS MADE CONTACT WITH LAO
EXILE LEADERS IN PARIS AND IS REPORTEDLY SEEKING TO RECRUIT LAO TRIBAL REFUGEES FROM REFUGEE CAMPS IN THAILAND
FOR MILITARY TRAINING IN CHINA.
CHINESE PRESSURE ON LAOS IS DESIGNED TO STRETCH VIETNAMESE FORCES EVEN THINNER OVER A PROLONGED PERIOD AND
TO KEEP THE SRV OFF BALANCE. AS LONG AS VIETNAM REMAINS
DETERMINED TO ACHIEVE ITS LONG CHERISHED DREAM OF HEGEMONY IN INDOCHINA, THE CHINESE CAN BE EXPECTED OVER THE
NEXT FEW YEARS TO MAKE THE VIETNAMESE PAY A HIGH PRICE.
THE CHINESE, HOWEVER, ARE MORE APT TO FOSTER ANTI-LAO
ACTIVITIES BY TRIBAL GROUPS THAN TO UNDERTAKE LARGE-SCALE
MILITARY OPERATIONS INSIDE LAOS. SHOULD THE CHINESE
ATTACK VIETNAM AGAIN, HOWEVER, THEY MAY CONCURRENTLY
ESTABLISH A SECOND FRONT IN LAOS, USING SOME OF THEIR
OWN MILITARY FORCES, BUT PRINCIPALLY RELYING ON INSURGENTS TO PIN DOWN VIETNAMESE FORCES.

CHINA IN THE HOPE OF FRUSTRATING TOTAL VIETNAMESE CONTROL OF KAMPUCHEA AND BALANCING THE INCREASED VIETNAMESE THREAT. MALAYSIA IS MORE CONCERNED OVER CHINA'S
LONG-TERM INTENTIONS IN THE REGION THAN THOSE OF THE
USSR. SINGAPORE BELIEVES THAT THE EXPANDING SOVIET
NAVAL PRESENCE IN THE REGION IS THE GREATEST IMMEDIATE
THREAT, WHILE RECOGNIZING THAT A MODERNIZED CHINA IS A
LONG-TERM PROBLEM. INSULATED BY GEOGRAPHY, THE PHILIPPINES FEELS THE LEAST THREATENED BY VIETNAM'S INVASION
OF KAMPUCHEA AND BY SINO-SOVIET RIVALRY IN SOUTHEAST
ASIA; THE FILIPINOS BELIEVE THEY CAN DEAL WITH THE PRC
AND ARE MOST WORRIED BY SOVIET INTENTIONS IN THE LONG
RUN.
WHATEVER THEIR GREATEST INDIVIDUAL FEARS, ALL THE ASEAN
STATES SHARE A COMMON AWARENESS OF THEIR MILITARY WEAKNESS. WHILE THEY ESCHEW A COLLECTIVE MILITARY ROLE
FOR ASEAN AND CONTINUE TO CONCENTRATE ON ECONOMIC AND
SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT AS THE BEST LONG RUN APPROACH TO
MAINTAINING STABILITY AND INDEPENDENCE -- AND ATTACH
GREAT IMPORTANCE TO CONTINUING TRADE AND AID FROM THE

PSYCHOLOGICAL SUPPORT FROM THE PRESENCE OF US FORCES
IN THE AREA.
WHILE THE THAI DO NOT RECEIVE MILITARY ASSISTANCE FROM
OTHER COUNTRIES, THE RTG HAS RECENTLY BEGUN TO PURCHASE
FROM THIRD COUNTRIES DEFENSE ITEMS WHICH ARE UNAVAILABLE

RECONNAISSANCE VEHICLES, ISRAELI ARTILLERY, AND ITALIAN
PATROL BOATS ARE EITHER IN USE OR ON ORDER. ACQUISITION

WITHIN THE REGION, THAILAND HAS A BORDER COOPERATION
AGREEMENT WITH MALAYSIA WHICH PROVIDES FOR COMBINED
MILITARY OPERATIONS AND TRAINING, AND A SMALL JOINT
PROGRAM WITH SINGAPORE TO PRODUCE GRENADE LAUNCHERS.
THE OTHER ASEAN NATIONS DO NOT ENVISION THE POSSIBILITY
OF A DIRECT THREAT FROM VIETNAM IN THE SAME WAY THAILAND
CAN. HOWEVER, MALAYSIA AND SINGAPORE AND INDONESIA TO
A LESSER DEGREE SHARE CONCERNS ABOUT GRADUAL ENCROACHMENT BY THE COMMUNIST POWERS AND DO NOT EXCLUDE THE
POSSIBILITY THAT COLLAPSE IN THAILAND WOULD LEAD TO
INCREASED REGIONAL AND INTERNAL TENSIONS AND INSTABILITY FOR THEMSELVES. ACCORDINGLY, THEY HAVE INITIATED
MODEST PROGRAMS TO MODERNIZE AND IN SOME CASES EXPAND

CORDIAL RELATIONS WITH CHINA WERE STRENGTHENED BY THE

INVASION OF KAMPUCHEA IN JANUARY 1979, MILITARY INCIDENTS
ON THE BORDER AND THE MASSIVE INFLOWS OF REFUGEES INTO
THAILAND FROM LAOS, KAMPUCHEA AND VIETNAM HAVE NOW CREATED A PERIOD OF ASCERBIC TENSION AND MILITARY UNCERTAINTY. IN KAMPUCHEA, THE THAI HAVE PROCLAIMED A NEUTRAL

IN ASIA. MAJOR EFFORTS WILL BE NEEDED TO UPHOLD
THE PRINCIPLE OF FIRST ASYLUM AND AVOID EVEN GREATER
TRAGEDY THAN HAS ALREADY OCCURRED.
THE EXODUS OF INDOCHINESE REFUGEES PEAKED IN MAY AND
JUNE WITH AN ESTIMATED 60,000 ARRIVALS IN FIRST ASYLUM
COUNTRIES IN THE LATTER MONTH. IT DIMINISHED MARKEDLY
IN JULY TO ABOUT 34,000 AND MUCH FURTHER IN AUGUST IN
THE WAKE OF THE GENEVA CONFERENCE TO APPROXIMATELY
12,000. AUGUST WAS THE FIRST TIME IN MANY MONTHS THAT
THE NUMBER OF REFUGEES DEPARTING FOR RESETTLEMENT, 19,466,
SUBSTANTIALLY EXCEEDED ARRIVALS. HOWEVER, OVER 350,000
REFUGEES REMAINED IN UNHCR CAMPS IN SOUTHEAST ASIA AS OF
MID-SEPTEMBER.
TESTIMONY OF REFUGEES AND OTHER EVIDENCE INDICATES THAT
THE DOWNTURN IN BOAT REFUGEES IS DUE DIRECTLY TO THE SRV'S
MORATORIUM ON &quot;ILLEGALS&quot; DEPARTING,WHICH WAS ANNOUNCED AT
GENEVA AND IS BEING ENFORCED BY THE VIETNAMESE GOVERNMENT. THE DECLINE IN LAO REFUGEES FROM AN AVERAGE OF
6,000 PER MONTH TO 3,000 IN AUGUST REFLECTS TOUGHER MEASURES BY BOTH THAI AND LAO AUTHORITIES. THE OUTLOOK IS
NOT ENCOURAGING, HOWEVER. THE NEW SRV OFFENSIVE INAUGURATED IN KAMPUCHEA WITH THE EARLY END OF THE RAINY SEASON WILL INTENSIFY FAMINE, DISEASE, AND SECURITY PROBLEMS AMONG THE KAMPUCHEAN PEOPLE AND AN OMINOUS AND
MASSIVE NEW EXODUS OF PERHAPS 200,000 REFUGEES INTO THAILAND IS PREDICTABLE. ARRANGEMENTS HAVE BEEN INITIATED
ON AN URGENT BASIS TO BRING FOOD AND MEDICINE TO KHMER
REFUGEES SITUATED ALONG THE BORDER AND INTO PHNOM PENH.
THE DONOR NATIONS ARE WORKING WITH UNHCR, UNICEF, THE
ICRC, THE WORLD FOOD PROGRAM, FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS AND
VOLUNTARY AGENCIES ON THE VARIOUS ASPECTS OF THIS PROBLEM,

TO KHMER UNDER HENG SAMRIN CONTROL HAVE BEEN MARKED BY
PRK AND VIETNAMESE STALLING, HOWEVER, AND NOW THAT THE OFFENSIVE IS UNDERWAY CHANCES OF GETTING SHIPMENTS DISTRIBUTED TO STAVE OFF MASSIVE DEATHS ARE DIMMING.
IN ADDITION TO THE PENDING LAND REFUGEE CRISIS THERE IS A
WIDESPREAD EXPECTATION THROUGHOUT ASIA, BACKED BY A NUMBER
OF POSITIVE INDICATIONS, THAT VIETNAM HAS NOT ALTERED ITS
BASIC GOAL OF RIDDING ITSELF OF &quot;UNDESIRABLE&quot; SINO-VIETNAMESE AND SOME ETHNIC VIETNAMESE. A RENEWAL OF HIGH LEVELS
OF BOAT REFUGEES BEFORE THE END FO THE YEAR IS ALSO WIDELY
ANTICIPATED.
IN LIGHT OF THESE EXPECTATIONS, APART FROM THE KAMPUCHEAN
RELIEF EFFORT, CONTINUING MAJOR RESETTLEMENT AND FINANCIAL
ASSISTANCE FROM THE WEALTHY NATIONS ARE REQUIRED. (RESETTLEMENT OFFERS AT THE TIME OF GENEVA FOR THE ENSURING
YEAR WERE 270,000 INCLUDING 168,000 FROM THE U.S.) THE
REFUGEE PROCESSING CENTERS NOW AGREED FOR CONSTRUCTION
ON BATAAN AND UNDERWAY ON GALANG ISLAND IN INDONESIA ARE
NEEDED URGENTLY TO HELP REDUCE REFUGEE POPULATIONS IN FIRST ASYLUM COUNTRIES AND ENCOURAGE HUMANE FIRST ASYLUM POLICIES. CONTINUING CONSCIENTIOUS EFFORT MUST BE MADE TO
WIDEN THE WORLD'S MERCHANT FLEET PARTICIPATION IN THE SEARCH AND RESCUE AT SEA EFFORTS -- OVER 600 BOAT REFUGEES
HAD BEEN RESCUED BY SEVENTH FLEET VESSELS AS OF MID-SEPTEMBER. LARGE NUMBERS OF EUROPEAN MERCHANT SHIPS -- AS
WELL AS REMARKABLE ITALIAN NAVAL TASK FORCE EFFORT -- HAVE
CHANGED COURSE AND RESCUED BOAT REFUGEES IN THE WEEKS

AN INTERESTING FEATURE OF THIS PERIOD HAS BEEN CHINA'S INCREASING POSITIVE CONTRIBUTION TO SOLUTION OF THE REFUGEE
PROBLEM, ALBEIT WITH THE CLEAR INTENT TO USE ITS EFFORTS
AS A MEANS OF EMBARRASSING HANOI. CHINA HAS ACKNOWLEDGED
THAT IT IS RESETTLING OVER 200,000 REFUGEES AND HAS OFFERED TO TAKE 10,000 MORE FOR RESETTLEMENT FROM SOUTHEAST
ASIAN CAMPS. IT ALSO RECENTLY REQUESTED UNHCR ASSISTANCE
TO SUPPORT SOME OF ITS RESETTLEMENT PROGRAMS
AND IT HAS ASKED FOR INTERNATIONAL FOOD ASSISTANCE.

PREEMINENCE. THE SEPTEMBER CENTRAL COMMITTEE PLENUM AND
YE'S NATIONAL DAY SPEECH INDICATE HIS POLICIES HAVE FORMALLY BEEN ACCEPTED.
IN MARCH AND APRIL, DENG APPEARED TO BE IN TROUBLE. A
COMBINATION OF POLICY PROBLEMS, NEGATIVE REACTIONS TO
THE IDEOLOGICAL LINE OF THE DENG-DOMINATED PARTY PLENUM
OF DECEMBER 1978, AND OPPOSITION TO HIS ABRASIVE PERSONAL STYLE HAD LED TO CRITICISM FROM A NUMBER OF QUARTERS.
THIS RESULTED IN A DIMUNITION OF DENG'S POLITICAL STANDING AND A WATERING DOWN OF HIS IDEOLOGICAL LINE. HE WAS
CRITICIZED FOR EXCESSES IN THE PRC'S AMBITIOUS ECONOMIC
MODERNIZATION PROGRAM, FOR PROMOTING DE-MAOIZATION AND
UNDERMINING THE SANCTITY OF MAO'S THOUGHT, AND FOR THE
SOCIAL DISORDER GROWING OUT OF THE &quot;DEMOCRACY&quot; MOVEMENT.
SENIOR ECONOMIC SPECIALISTS TOOK A HARD LOOK AT THE SPECIFICS OF THE ECONOMIC MODERNIZATION PROGRAM, SCALED IT
DOWN TO MORE REALISTIC LEVELS AND REDIRECTED PRIORITIES
AWAY FROM HEAVY INDUSTRY AND TOWARD AGRICULTURE. IDEOLOGICALLY, THE MEDIA PROMOTED THE &quot;FOUR UPHOLDS:&quot; 1) KEEP-

MARXISM-LENINISM-MAO ZEDONG THOUGHT. FINALLY, NATIONWIDE, THERE WAS A CRACKDOWN ON THE &quot;DEMOCRACY&quot; MOVEMENT.
BY MID-MAY, DENG HAS BEGUN TO COUNTERATTACK. USING THE
MEDIA TO REASSERT HIS FAVORITE THEMES -- THE FALLIBILITY
OF MAO, THE NEED FOR &quot;DEMOCRACY&quot; AS A PREREQUISITE FOR
ECONOMIC MODERNIZATION, AND &quot;SEEKING TRUTH FROM FACTS,&quot;
HE ATTACKED AS &quot;LEFTISTS&quot; THOSE WHO CLAIMED THAT THE
&quot;DEMOCRACY&quot; MOVEMENT HAD GONE TOO FAR OR WHO HAD OPPOSED

GRESS, HELD IN JUNE-JULY, DENG MAINTAINED A LOW PROFILE.
THE ISSUES HE HAD EARLIER STRESSED -- THE FREE DISCUSSION
OF CONTROVERSIAL IDEAS, THE CRITICISM OF ERRANT CADRE, THE
ABANDONMENT OF OBSOLETE DOGMA AND ADOPTION OF A PRAGMATIC,
GOAL-ORIENTED IDEOLOGY -- WON WIDESPREAD APPROVAL FROM THE
DELEGATES. PARTY CHAIRMAN HUA GUOFENG MOVED A LONG-WAY
TOWARD IDENTIFYING HIMSELF WITH THESE DENGIST POSITIONS.
DENG LEFT BEIJING SHORTLY AFTER THE CONGRESS AND DID NOT
REAPPEAR PUBLICLY IN THE CAPITAL FOR MORE THAN SIX WEEKS.
PART OF THIS TIME WAS APPARENTLY SPENT ON VACATION, BUT
DENG ALSO TRAVELED TO VARIOUS PROVINCES AND CITIES MAKING
INSPECTIONS, HEARING OPINIONS, EXPOUNDING HIS IDEAS, AND
APPARENTLY LINING UP POLITICAL SUPPORT. HAVING MENDED HIS
POLITICAL FENCES, DENG IS ONCE AGAIN PUSHING FOR A JUDGMENT AGAINST HIS POLITBURO ADVERSARIES.
DENG AND HIS SUPPORTERS BELIEVE IDEOLOGY AND THE PARTY
ORGANIZATION MUST BE REFORMED BEFORE CHINA CAN MAKE PROGRESS TOWARD ITS GOAL OF &quot;SOCIALIST MODERNIZATION.&quot; FOR
MORE THAN A YEAR THEY HAVE PUSHED THE CAMPAIGN TO FREE
CHINESE IDEOLOGY FROM THE RIGID DOGMATISM THAT LED TO SUCH
DISRUPTIVE AND DESTRUCTIVE PROGRAMS AS THE GREAT LEAP FORWARD AND THE CULTURAL REVOLUTION. THEY BELIEVE THAT MANY
PARTY OFFICIALS PROMOTED DURING THE CULTURAL REVOLUTION
ARE ILL-SUITED TO LEAD CHINA TOWARD ITS GOAL OF SOLID
ECONOMIC PROGRESS IN THE 1980S, AS THEY ARE INCOMPETENT,
NOT IDEOLOGICALLY WELL-DISPOSED TOWARD THE NEW POLICIES,
AND HAVE FAILED TO IMPLEMENT THEM PROPERLY.

AND CRITICISM OF THE &quot;WHATEVER FACTION&quot; HAS BECOME A MAJOR
THEME IN THE MEDIA. BOTH OF THESE ARE THINLY VEILED ATTACKS AGAINST POLITBURO MEMBER WANG DONGXING AND SOURCES
OF OTHER ERRANT OFFICIALS THROUGHOUT THE PRC BUREAUCRACY;
-- AUTHORITATIVE MEDIA COMMENTARIES HAVE CONDEMNED THE
CORRUPTION AND MISUSE OF AUTHORITY OF UNNAMED OFFICIALS;
-- THE PARTY'S THEORETICAL JOURNAL, &quot;RED FLAG,&quot; HAS ADMITTED THAT IT ERRED IN NOT FULLY SUPPORTING THE NEW
IDEOLOGICAL LINE. THE JOURNAL WAS FORMERLY UNDER THE
DIRECTION OF WANG;
-- NON-DENGINST PROVINCIAL LEADERS CONTINUE TO BE EASED
OUT.
THE PROVINCES HAVE PROVIDED DENG WITH STRONG BACKING. PROVINCIAL MEDIA HAVE BEEN ACTIVE IN LINKING ORGANIZATIONAL
AND PERSONNEL PROBLEMS TO THE IDEOLOGICAL ISSUE. CITING
INCORRECT IDEOLOGY AS THE ROOT CAUSE OF PROBLEMS, SEVERAL
PROVINCIAL LEADERS HAVE MOUNTED A RENEWED AND STRENGTHENED
ATTACK AGAINST FACTIONALISM. IDEOLOGICAL CONFUSION IS
BLAMED FOR THE FAILURE TO ERADICATE THESE PROBLEMS NEARLY
THREE YEARS AFTER THE PURGE OF THE GANG OF FOUR. MOST
COMMENTATORS HAVE STRESSED THE NEED FOR LENIENCY AND RESTRAINT, BUT THERE ARE INCREASING CALLS FOR TOUGHER MEASURES, INCLUDING A PURGE OF RECALCITRANTS AND FOOT DRAGGERS.
WHILE OPPOSITION TO DENG AND HIS IDEOLOGY STILL EXISTS,
IT APPEARS TO BE GROWING PROGRESSIVELY WEAKER. MANY CADRES AT VARIOUS LEVELS STILL FEEL THREATHENED BY THE IDEOLOGICAL AND POLICY REVERSALS BROUGHT ABOUT BY HIS LEADERSHIP. THEY FEAR THEY WILL NOW BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR
CARRYING OUT THE &quot;ULTRA-LEFTIST&quot; POLICIES OF THE PAST.
OTHERS FEEL THAT A LEFTIST RESURGENCE IN THE FUTURE WOULD

SOME CADRES HAVE ALSO FELT THAT VARIOUS DENGIST POLICY
INITIATIVES WERE POORLY CONCEIVED AND HASTILY DECIDED;
THEY HAVE QUESTIONED DENG'S LEADERSHIP ABILITIES.

DENG MAINTAINS CONSIDERABLE SUPPORT WITHIN THE ARMED FORCES AND AT TE UPPER MIDDLE LEVELS OF THE PARTY HIERARCHY,
AND HE HAS NOW OBTAINED THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE'S APPROVAL
FOR HIS IDEOLOGY AND POLICIES. HE IS LIKELY TO KEEP
PRESSING FOR HIS POLICIES AND ADDITIONAL PERSONNEL CHANGES AS THE PARTY MOVES TOWARD ITS 12TH CONGRESS.
OTHER GROUPS, HOWEVER, WILL PLAY KEY ROLES IN DETERMINING
THE OUTCOME OF DENG'S CAMPAIGN. THE ECONOMIC SPECIALISTS,
TITULARLY LED BY PARTY VICE CHAIRMAN CHEN YUN, HAVE EMERGED AS A NEW INTEREST GROUP. NEWLY REHABILITATED VICTIMS
OF THE CULTURAL REVOLUTION HAVE WON IMPORTANT POSTS IN
THE GOVERNMENT, AND ARE LIKELY TO PLAY A CENTRAL ROLE IN
PARTY DECISION-MAKING AS WELL. IT IS NOT CLEAR THAT
THESE GROUPS WILL COMPLETELYSUPPORTED DENG'S POSITION IN T6E

MAOISTS TO CONTINUE TO HOLD PARTY POSITIONS, BUT DEPRIVE
THEM OF REAL POLITICAL POWER AND INSTITUTIONAL BASES OF

IN DECEMBER 1978, CHINA REACHED A CROSSROADS ON ITS PATH
TO ECONOMIC MODERNIZATION. ITS HEADLONG RUSH INTO A PROGRAM TO DEVELOP THE ECONOMY THROUGH MASSIVE INFUSIONS OF
ADVANCED WESTERN TECHNOLOGY AND EQUIPMENT INVOLVED STAGGERING SUMS. CHINESE COMMERCIAL DELEGATIONS ABROAD HAD
INQUIRED INTO OR NEGOTIATED FOR AT LEAST $80 BILLION
WORTH OF FOREIGN CAPITAL EQUIPMENT. THE CHINESE HAD SIGNED CONTRACTS AMOUNTING TO $7 BILLION, INCLUDING $5 BILLION
IN ONE 10-DAY STRETCH IN DECEMBER. SUCH A HECTIC PACE
COULD NOT CONTINUE BECAUSE CHINA WAS RAPIDLY EXHAUSTING
ITS FOREIGN EXCHANGE RESERVES.
FOLLOWING THE DECEMBER PLENUM OF THE CHINESE COMMUNIST
PARTY, BEIJING CALLED A HALT TO THE BUYING SPREE WHILE
CHINA'S LEADERS REASSESSED THE ENTIRE DIRECTION AND SCOPE
OF THE MODERNIZATION PROGRAM. IN FEBRUARY, BEIJING NOT
ONLY HALTED ONGOING NEGOTIATIONS FOR NEW PLANTS BUT ALSO
SUSPENDED SOME $2.6 BILLION WORTH OF PLANT CONTRACTS SIGNED WITH JAPANESE FIRMS AFTER 16 DECEMBER. FOREIGN BUSINESSMEN WERE TOLD NOT TO EXPECT A RESUMPTION OF CONTRACT
TALKS UNTIL THE SECOND HALF OF 1979.

THE REASSESSMENT WAS APPARENTLY COMPLETED BY JUNE. LATE
THAT MONTH THE NATIONAL PEOPLE'S CONGRESS (NPC) MET TO
RATIFY THE DECISIONS MADE BY BEIJING'S LEADERS DURING THE
INTERLUDE. THE CHOICES MADE WILL HAVE MAJOR IMPLICATIONS
FOR CHINA'S FOREIGN ECONOMIC RELATIONS FOR YEARS TO COME.
FIRST, BEIJING DECIDED THAT GREATER &quot;BALANCE&quot; WAS NEEDED
BETWEEN THE VARIOUS SECTORS OF THE ECONOMY. BEIJING
WOULD SCALE BACK INVESTMENT IN HEAVY INDUSTRY IN ORDER TO
PROVIDE MORE FUNDS TO AGRICULTURE AND LIGHT INDUSTRY.
WHILE THIS UNDOUBTEDLY MEANS THAT BEIJING WILL POSTPONE
ITS PLANS TO PURCHASE SEVERAL STEEL MILLS FROM ABROAD -AND PROBABLY OTHER MAJOR DEVELOPMENTS PROJECTS AS WELL -SECRET
SECRET
PAGE 32

STATE 263929

IT DOES NOT MEAN THAT CHINA IS SHELVING ITS MODERNIZATION
PLANS AND RETURNING TO THE INWARD-LOOKING POLICIES OF THE
PAST. INDEED, BEIJING HAS -OMMITTED ITSELF TO EXPANDI;G
TRADE BY DEVELOPING NEW EXPORT INDUSTRIES. THE CHINESE
LEADERSHIP BELIEVES THAT CHANNELING MORE FUNDS INTO LIGHT
INDUSTRY WILL PRODUCE A GREATER AND MORE IMMEDIATE RETURN
ON THE INVESTMENT, AND SUBSTANTIALLY BOOST FOREIGN EXCHANGE EARNINGS. MOREOVER, BEIJING HAS ADVANCED ITS PLANS
TO PURCHASE ELECTRIC POWER PLANTS, TRANSPORTATION AND COMMUNICATIONS FACILITIES, AND OTHER EQUIPMENT TO DEVELOP
CHINA'S ECONOMIC INFRASTRUCTURE.
SECOND, IN ANNOUNCING TO THE NPC THAT CHINA PLANNED TO
BORROW FOREIGN FUNDS TO FINANCE A LARGE PORTION OF ITS
CAPITAL IMPORTS, BEIJING FORMALLY BROKE WITH THE MAOIST
DICTUM WHICH HELD THAT FOREIGN INDEBTEDNESS COULD NOT BE
CONDONED. (VICE PREMIER YU QIULI TOLD THE NPC THAT CHINA
PLANNED TO RUN A RECORD $3.5 BILLION TRADE DEFICIT THIS
YEAR.) LONG BEFORE THE NPC MET, CHINA'S INTENTION TO
ENGAGE IN DEBT FINANCING HAD BECOME APPARENT. FROM
DECEMBER 1978 THROUGH MAY OF THIS YEAR, CHINA ARRANGED
CREDIT LINES TOTALING MORE THAN $25 BILLION. THE NPC
MERELY GAVE ITS SANCTION TO THIS POLICY.
FINALLY, THE NPC APPROVED A LAW WHICH WOULD PERMIT, FOR
THE FIRST TIME, DIRECT FOREIGN INVESTMENT IN THE FORM
OF JOINT VENTURES BETWEEN CHINESE CORPORATIONS AND PRIVATE
FOREIGN FIRMS. UNDER SOME CIRCUMSTANCES, FOREIGNERS MAY
EVEN BE ALLOWED TO HOLD 100-PERCENT EQUITY IN PLANTS LOCATED IN CHINA. THIS POLICY ABSOLUTELY REVERSES THE MAOIST STANCE ON THE QUESTION OF FOREIGN OWNERSHIP OF THE
&quot;MEANS OF PRODUCTION&quot; IN THE CHINESE ECONOMY. LACKING ANY

TRACK RECORD, IT IS DIFFICULT TO FORECAST HOW MUCH FOREIGN
CAPITAL CHINA WILL BE ABLE TO ATTRACT BY THIS MEANS. ONLY
FOUR OTHER COMMUNIST COUNTRIES (POLAND, HUNGARY, ROMANIA,
AND YUGOSLAVIA) HAVE PERMITTED JOINT VENTURES, BUT NONE
ALLOW 100-PERCENT FOREIGN EQUITY; AND THERE THE RESULTS
HAVE BEEN MIXED. IN CHINA'S CASE, HOWEVER, AN ABUNDANT
LABOR SUPPLY -- AND LOW WAGES -- COULD PROVE TO BE A MAJOR
ATTRACTION TO WESTERN INVESTORS. IN THE LONG RUN, THIS
STEP COULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT.
THE NEW CHINESE ADMINISTRATION HAS CLEARLY STAKED ITS
POLITICAL FUTURE ON ECONOMIC MODERNIZATION. THE VIABILITY OF THE PROGRAM WILL DEPEND LARGELY ON THE SKILL OF
CHINA'S PLANNERS IN ARRANGING FOR THE SYSTEMATIC ABSORPTION OF FOREIGN TECHNOLOGY AND RAISING THE FOREIGN EXCHANGE NEEDED TO HELP MEET THE BILLS.
THERE ARE GROUNDS FOR OPTIMISM, AS THE NEW POLICIES EMBODY AN UNPRECENDENTLY RATIONAL APPROACH TO CHINA'S ECONOMIC PROBLEMS. COMPARED TO THE MAOIST ERA, THE LEADERSHIP
IS MUCH LESS BOUND BY IDEOLOGICAL CONSTRAINTS IN ITS POLICY CHOICES. IN THEIR REASSESSMENT AND REDRAFTING OF
POLICIES DURING THE FIRST HALF OF 1979, THE CHINESE HAVE
DEMONSTRATED AN ABILITY TO REACT QUICKLY AND RATIONALLY
TO NEW PROBLEMS CREATED BY THE NEW POLICIES.
IN THE SHORT TERM, PERHAPS THE MOST DIFFICULT PROBLEMS
THEY WILL FACE WILL BE THOSE OF HANDLING RISING CONSUMER
EXPECTATIONS, AND PROVIDING EMPLOYMENT FOR THE MILLIONS
OF JUNIOR AND MIDDLE SCHOLL GRADUATES. THESE, PLUS THE
LONG LEAD TIMES REQUIRED TO BRING NEW PROJECTS INTO PRODUCTION IN BOTTLENECK SECTORS, MAKE IT LIKELY THAT THE
CURRENT PERIOD OF &quot;READJUSTING, RESTRUCTURING, CONSOLIDATING AND IMPROVING THE ECONOMY&quot; WILL LAST LONGER THAN
THAN THE PLANNED THREE YEARS. THE CHINESE SIXTH FIVESECRET

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
TO DEVELOP HIS STANDING AMONG THE JAPANESE ELECTORATES AND
WITHIN HIS OWN PARTY HIERARCHY. OHIRA IS A RELATIVELY
POPULAR PARTY LEADER AND FREE OF ASSOCIATION WITH EARLIER
SCANDALS WHICH HAVE PLAGUED THE LDP. HIS CONFIDENCE WAS
REFLECTED IN HIS DECISION TO CALL FOR ELECTIONS ON OCTOBER 7, IN WHICH HE HOPED TO REVERSE THE PATTERN OF THE
PAST AND PICK UP SEATS IN THE LOWER HOUSE. (OHIRA'S
GOAL HAD BEEN 271 -- OF 511 -- LOWER HOUSE SEATS, AN INCREASE OF 22 OVER ITS PRESENT 249 SEATS, AND A LARGE ENOUGH MAJORITY TO REGAIN CONTROL OF THE CRITICAL LEGISLATIVE
BUDGET COMMITTEE.) OHIRA WAS EXPECTED TO BE IN A STRONGER
POSITION AFTER THE ELECTION.
A MAJOR CABINET RESHUFFLE IS EXPECTED IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING THE ELECTION AND CHANGES ARE LIKELY IN VIRTUALLY ALL
OF THE CABINET POSITIONS. ACTIVISTS FOREIGN MINISTER
SUNAO SONODA, THE ONLY HOLDOVER FROM THE PREVIOUS FUKUDA
CABINET, IS EXPECTED TO SHIFT TO A PARTY POSITION, A LOGICAL MOVE IN TERMS OF HIS OWN FUTURE ASPIRATIONS. THE NEW
CABINET IS NOT EXPECTED TO AUGUR ANY SUBSTANTIAL CHANGES
IN FOREIGN OR DOMESTIC POLICY.
THE MAJOR DIPLOMATIC GOAL OF THE OHIRA GOVERNMENT HAS
BEEN THE RESOLUTION OF ECONOMIC DIFFERENCES WITH THE U.S.
THROUGH A SERIES OF INTENSE DISCUSSIONS AT VARIOUS LEVELS,
AND PERSONAL DISCUSSIONS BETWEEN THE PRESIDENT AND PRIME

MINISTER IN WASHINGTON IN MAY AND IN TOKYO IN JUNE, MUCH
PROGRESS HAS BEEN MADE IN RESOLVING THESE DIFFERENCES.
THE SUCCESSFUL CONCLUSION OF MTN NEGOTIATIONS AND PROGRESS
ON SPECIFIC TRADE ISSUES SUCH AS BEEF, CITRUS, AND NTT
PROCUREMENT HAVE BEEN ACCOMPLISHED IN RECENT MONTHS. THE
DRAMATIC DECLINE OF JAPAN'S CURRENT ACCOUNT SURPLUS, WHILE
RELATED TO OTHER FACTORS SUCH AS THE INCREASE IN CRUDE OIL
PRICES, ALSO REFLECTS AN ACTIVE EFFORT TO RESTORE BALANCE
TO JAPAN'S INTERNATIONAL TRANSACTIONS. WHILE A LARGE
TRADE SURPLUS WITH THE U.S. STILL REMAINS, THIS SURPLUS
APPEARS TO BE IN DECLINE AND U.S. EXPORTS TO JAPAN HAVE
INCREASED SHARPLY.
SINCE THE SIGNING OF SINO-JAPANESE PEACE AND FRIENDSHIP
TREATY (PFT) IN AUGUST 1978, THE PACE OF BILATERAL RELATIONS BETWEEN JAPAN AND THE PRC HAS PICKED UP CONSIDERABLY.
AN AGREEMENT IN PRINCIPLE TO DOUBLE OR TRIPLE THE ORIGINAL
COMMITMENTS REACHED IN THE SINO-JAPANESE LONG-TERM AGREEMENT (LTTA) HAS BEEN REACHED. A TOTAL OF $10 BILLION IN
JAPANESE EXIM BANK AND SYNDICATED BANK LOANS WAS EXTENDED
TO THE PRC EARLIER THIS YEAR TO ASSIST WITH CHINA'S MODERN-

DEVELOPMENT. THE GOJ WILL REVIEW THE SIZEABLE ($5.5

AS WELL AS THE INTERESTS OF OTHER DEVELOPING NATIONS,
PARTICULARLY ASEAN, AND THE VIEWS OF THE DEVELOPED NATIONS.

ARENA BY GIVING THE CHINESE AN INTEREST IN TAKING A CONSTRUCTIVE ROLE IN INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC
ISSUES. THERE IS GENERAL AGREEMENT TO SUPPORT CHINA'S
MODERNIZATION (EXCEPT IN THE MILITARY AREA) AND TO SEEK
WAYS TO COOPERATE WITH OTHER INDUSTRIALIZED DEMOCRACIES
IN THE CHINA MARKET. THE JAPANESE DO NOT SEEM EAGER TO
SEE INCREASED SALES OF SOPHISTICATED WEAPONRY TO CHINA,
HOWEVER, BELIEVING THAT A FULLY MODERN CHINESE MILITARY
WOULD BE A DESTABILIZING INFLUENCE IN THE AREA.
WHILE THE PRC WOULD OBVIOUSLY LIKE TOSTEER JAPAN AWAY
FROM ITS POLICY OF BALANCE IN RELATIONS WITH THE SOVIET
UNION AND CHINA, THE JAPANESE HAVEHELD TO THE PRINCIPLE
THAT RELATIONS WITH BEIJING ARE SEPARATE AND DISTINCT FROM
RELATIONS WITH MOSCOW. JAPAN HAS INSISTED THAT RELATIONSHIPS WITH EACH OF HER GIANT COMMUNIST NEIGHBORS ARE TO
BE PURSUED INDEPENDENTLY AND WITHOUT LINKAGES AND THAT
TOKYO WILL SEEK TO IMPROVE RELATIONS WITH BOTH.
JAPAN'S RELATIONS WITH THE SOVIET UNION, NEVER PARTICULARLY WARM, HAVE BLOWN TEPID, THEN COOLER IN RECENT MONTHS.
IN RESPONDING TO SOVIET CRITICISMS OF JAPAN'S SIGNING
OF THE PEACE AND FRIENDSHIP TREATY WITH CHINA, THE JAPANESE HAD INSISTED THAT THEIR POLICIES TOWARD MOSCOW AND
BEIJING WERE INDEPENDENT OF EACH OTHER. THE MAY VISIT OF
DEPUTY FOREIGN MINISTER FIRYUBIN SUGGESTED A CHANGE IN THE
SOVIET APPROACH TO JAPAN AND IT APPEARED THAT THERE WAS
SOME POSSIBILITY OF IMPROVED RELATIONS. THE TWO SIDES
AGREED IN PRINCIPLE TO CONTINUE THE VICE-MINISTERIAL TALKS
IN MOSCOW AND THE JAPANESE RENEWED AN INVITATION TO FOREIGN MINISTER GROMYKO TO VISIT JAPAN, A VISIT WHICH THE
JAPANESE WOULD REGARD AS A SIGN OF MOSCOW'S INTENT TO IMPROVE RELATIONS.

DESPITE THESE HOPEFUL SIGNS, THE NORTHERN TERRITORIES ISSUE REMAINED A MAJOR OBSTACLE TO CLOSER TIES BETWEEN TOKYO AND MOSCOW. IN JULY SOVIET AMBASSADOR POLYANSKIY RESTATED THE FACT THAT THE SOVIETS HAD NO INTENTION OF RETURNING THE CONTESTED ISLANDS TO JAPAN. REACTING TO
INCREASED PUBLIC CONCERN ABOUT RUMORS OF INCREASED SOVIET
MILITARY ACTIVITY IN THE NORTHERN TERRITORIES, FOREIGN
MINISTER SONODA VISITED HOKKAIDO EARLY LAST MONTH AND
AFTER CRUISING NEAR THE ISLANDS IN A JAPANESE PATROL
SHIP, ANNOUNCED THAT THE GOJ WOULD MAKE RENEWED EFFORTS
TO SEEK THE RETURN OF THE ISLANDS. THE SOVIETS RESPONDED
THAT SONODA'S ACTIONS COULD NOT BE INTERPRETED BY MOSCOW
AS A SIGN OF JAPAN'S WILLINGNESS TO IMPROVE RELATIONS.
RECENT COMPLAINT TO MOSCOW OVER ESTABLISHMENT OF A NEW
SOVIFT BASE IN SHIKOTAN, ONLY 80 KMS FROM HOKKAIDO, HAS
FUELED THE CONTROVERSY EVEN FURTHER.
JAPAN'S INTERESTS IN SOUTHEAST ASIA HAVE LED TO A POLICY
OF CLOSE COOPERATION WITH THE ASEAN NATIONS. THE FIVE
ASEAN NATIONS ARE OF MAJOR IMPORTANCE TO JAPAN ECONOMICALLY. IN POLITICAL TERMS, JAPAN CONSIDERS A STRONG
ASEAN TO BE THE KEY TO THE REGION'S FUTURE STABILITY. TOKYO HAS ATTEMPTED TO ENHANCE ITS TIES WITH THE AREA BY
GIVING AMOUNTS OF OVERSEAS DEVELOPMENT ASSISTANCE AND
EARLIER THIS YEAR ANNOUNCED THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE FIRST
JAPAN-ASEAN ECONOMIC COOPERATION PROJECT. THE ASEAN
NATIONS HAVE WELCOMED JAPANESE AID ALTHOUGH THERE IS STILL
SOME CONCERN ABOUT POSSIBLE ECONOMIC DOMINATION BY JAPAN.
JAPAN HAS SHARED ASEAN'S CONCERN ABOUT THE INSTABILITY
OF INDOCHINA. TOKYO HAS BEEN ACTIVE IN DIPLOMATIC EFFORTS
TO RESTORE PEACE TO THE AREA AND DURING THE SINO-VIETNAMESE BORDER CONFLICT, JAPAN OFFERED

THE SITUATION ON THE KOREAN PENINSULA WITH ITS IMPLICATIONS FOR PEACE AND STABILITY IN THE AREA REMAINS ONE
OF JAPAN'S FOREIGN POLICY PREOCCUPATIONS. JAPAN HOPES
THAT THE TRIPARTITE TALKS PROPOSED BY ROK PRESIDENT PARK

TO SEEKING POSSIBLE WAYS TO REDUCE NORTH-SOUTH TENSIONS
BY DIPLOMATIC MEANS. AT THE SAME TIME JAPAN RECOGNIZES
THE IMPORTANCE OF MAINTAINING THE STRENGTH AND CONFIDENCE

VES ITS SECURITY INTERESTS AS WELL AS OURS.
IN AREAS OF THE WORLD OUTSIDE OF EAST AND SOUTHEAST ASIA,
JAPAN CONSIDERS THE MIDDLE EAST A VITALLY IMPORTANT
AREA FOR JAPANESE INTERESTS. APPROXIMATELY 80 OF JAPAN'S
CRUDE OIL IMPORTS COME FROM THE MIDDLE EAST AND JAPAN'S
VULNERABILITY AND DEPENDENCE ON MIDDLE EAST SOURCES WERE
CLEARLY DEMONSTRATED IN THE 1973 ARAB OIL EMBARGO. THE
JAPANESE HAVE DEVELOPED EXPERTISE IN DEALING WITH THE
ARAB WORLD AND A SIGNIFICANT PROPORTION OF JAPANESE OVERSEAS DEVELOPMENT ASSISTANCE NOW GOES TO THE MIDDLE EAST.
NONETHELESS, THE JAPANESE HAVE EXPRESSED STRONG SUPPORT
FOR THE PEACE TREATY BETWEEN EGYPT AND ISRAEL AS THE FIRST
STEP IN A COMPREHENSIVE MIDDLE EAST SETTLEMENT, AND DESPITE PRESSURE FROM THE ARAB WORLD, HAVE CONTINUED THEIR
SIGNIFICANT ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS IN EGYPT. JAPAN HAS CALLED
FOR A FINAL PEACE SETTLEMENT WHICH WOULD IMPLEMENT UNSC
RESOLUTIONS 242 AND 338 RECOGNIZING THE RIGHTS OF THE
PALESTINIAN PEOPLE AND HAS CALLED FOR PLO PARTICIPATION
IN THE PEACE PROCESS. THEY HAVE URGED RESTRAINT ON BOTH

SIDES, CALLING FOR A HALT OF TERRORIST ACTIVITY AND CRITICIZING THE ESTABLISHMENT OF ISRAELI SETTLEMENTS IN THE
OCCUPIED TERRITORIES.
JAPAN WAS ALARMED BY THE SUDDEN COLLAPSE OF THE SHAH OF
IRAN BUT MOVED QUICKLY TO ESTABLISH TIES WITH THE NEW
GOVERNMENT. WHILE VITAL OIL SUPPLIES HAVE CONTINUED, AND
THE JAPANESE CONSIDER THE RELATIONSHIP WITH THE NEW GOVERNMENT TO BE SATISFACTORY, THERE IS APPREHENSION IN TOKYO
ABOUT THE FUTURE. THE JAPANESE HAVE CONTINUED TO SUPPORT
DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS IN IRAN, AND THE GOJ HAS RECENTLY
ANNOUNCED THAT IT WOULD UNDERWRITE PART OF THE COSTS OF THE
PROJECT TO CONSTRUCT A LARGE PETROCHEMICAL FACILITY AT
BANDAR SHAPUR.

JAPAN HAS ALSO EXPRESSED ITS INTENT TO PLAY A LARGER ROLE
IN AFRICA. THE JAPANESE HAVE REAFFIRMED THEIR INTENT TO
PARTICIPATE IN A SUBSTANTIAL WAY IN THE UNTAG IN NAMIBIA,
PLEDGING BOTH PERSONNEL (CIVILIANS) AND EQUIPMENT FOR THE
EFFORT. JAPAN HAS ACTIVELY PARTICIPATED IN THE MEETINGS
OF THE DONOR'S GROUP FOR ZAIRE AND HAS EXTENDED SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS OF AID TO MOBUTU. JAPAN CONTINUES TO BE THE
SECOND LARGEST CONTRIBUTOR TO THE AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT
BANK.
JAPAN HAS ALSO ANNOUNCED ITS DESIRE TO BE MORE ACTIVE IN
LATIN AMERICA. FOREIGN MINISTER SONODA RECENTLY COMPLETED
A VISIT TO SIX LATIN AMERICAN NATIONS. THREE OF HIS
CABINET COLLEAGUES HAVE ALSO VISITED LATIN AMERICA IN RECENT MONTHS TO DISCUSS TRADE EXPANSION AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT.
AS CAN BE EXPECTED FROM THE WORLD'S SECOND LARGEST ECONOMIC POWER, JAPAN HAS BEEN DEVELOPING A MORE ASSERTIVE
FOREIGN POLICY WITH WIDER HORIZONS. WHILE JAPANESE POLICY
WILL ALWAYS CONCENTRATE ON THE NEED TO SECURE SUPPLIES OF
ESSENTIAL RESOURCES AND MARKETS, A LARGER POLITICAL ROLE
CAN BE EXPECTED AND IS WELCOME. DESPITE DIFFERENCES IN
LANGUAGE AND CULTURE, SIMILARITIES IN POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY
AND ECONOMIC STRUCTURE LEADS JAPAN TO THE PURSUIT OF OBJECTIVES COMMON TO THE WESTERN DEMOCRACIES.
JAPAN'S &quot;NEW&quot; ASSERTIVE AND INDEPENDENT FOREIGN POLICY
HAS BEEN ATTRIBUTED TO ITS FOREIGN MINISTER, SUNAO SONODA,
WHOSE EXTENSIVE TRAVELS DURING THE PAST TWO YEARS HAVE
CALLED ATTENTION TO JAPAN'S EFFORTS TO EXPAND HER ROLE

AROUND THE WORLD. IN FACT, THE TREND TOWARD GREATER ACTIVISM IN FOREIGN POLICY HAS BEEN A GRADUAL PROCESS AND ONE
WHICH WE WOULD EXPECT TO CONTINUE AFTER SONODA'S DEPARTURE.
GIVEN JAPAN'S STRENGTHS, AN EXPANDED ROLE FOR JAPAN IN
INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS WILL BE A DEVELOPMENT OF CONSIDERABLE
SIGNIFICANCE.
VII. KOREA
THE DEMOCRATIC PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF KOREA
THE PAST YEAR HAS BEEN A DECIDEDLY MIXED ONE FOR NORTH
KOREA. THE SINO-JAPANESE PFT UNPLEASANTLY SURPRISED
PYONGYANG, WHICH THEN SAW ITS PRINCIPAL ALLY, CHINA, MOVE
TOWARD ITS MAIN ADVERSARY, THE UNITED STATES, IN THE
NORMALIZATION PROCESS. WHILE THE ONSET OF SINO-AMERICAN
NORMALIZATION MAY HAVE INSPIRED NORTH KOREA'S TEMPORARY
WILLINGNESS TO EXPLORE DIALOGUE WITH SEOUL, THE MOST PROFOUND EXTERNAL DEVELOPMENT WAS THE CHINESE ATTACK ON
VIETNAM. THIS ACTION AGAINST A NEIGHBORING SOCIALIST
STATE AND FORMER CLOSE CHINESE ALLY REPORTEDLY ALARMED
PYONGYANG AND MAY HAVE AFFECTED PYONGYANG'S HABITUAL POSTURE OF FAVORING CHINA IN THE SINO-SOVIET SPLIT.
NORTH KOREAN FOREIGN POLICIES AND ATTITUDES TOOK ON AN
UNUSUALLY MODERATE COMPLEXION IN THE NON-ALIGNED MOVEMENT
(NAM), AS NORTH KOREA SUCCESSFULLY STROVE TO GAIN A SEAT
ON THE NAM'S COORDINATING COMMITTEE. IN THE HAVANA NAM
SUMMIT, NORTH KOREA LINED UP BEHIND YUGOSLAVIA IN TRYING
TO BLOCK THE VIETNAMESE-CUBAN EFFORTS TO PUSH THE NAM
INTO PRO-SOVIET STANCES. IT IS TOO EARLY TO PREDICT WHETHER MODERATION WILL APPEAR INCREASINGLY IN OTHER AREAS OF
NORTH KOREAN POLICY, ALTHOUGH WE ANTICIPATE LITTLE FLEXIBILITY IN PYONGYANG'S POSITIONS ON TROOP WITHDRAWAL AND
KOREAN REUNIFICATION.

INDICATOR OF ITS INTENTIONS IN ECONOMIC AND EVEN POLITICAL

MANCE IS NOT KEEPING UP WITH SEVERAL KEY AREAS IN THE NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT PLAN, BUT THE MILITARY CONTINUES TO DRAW
UPWARDS OF 15 OF GNP.
U.S. INTELLIGENCE ESTIMATES PLACE THE NORTH KOREAN ARMY
AT ABOUT FORTY DIVISIONS, THE FIFTH-LARGEST IN THE WORLD.
THAT ARMY CONTINUES TO BE OFFENSIVELY DEPLOYED FOR QUICK,
DECISIVE ATTACK ON SEOUL AND THE SOUTH, BUT THERE HAS
BEEN NO EVIDENCE, POLITICAL OR MILITARY, OF PYONGYANG'S
IMMINENT INTENTION TO STRIKE.
KIM IL-SONG CONTINUES TO RULE THE DPRK IN AN AUTOCRATIC,
TOTALITARIAN, CLOSETED FASHION THAT IS, FORTUNATELY, ALMOST UNPARALLELED IN TODAY'S WORLD. HIS HEALTH REMAINS
GOOD. THERE IS NO APPARENT AGREEMENT ON A MECHANISM FOR
SUCCESSION, BUT A MOVE TO PLACE HIS SON, KIM CHONG-IL,
IN POSITION AS THE HEIR HAS AGAIN GAINED SOME MOMENTUM.
PHOTOS OF THIS DYNAMIC DUO HAVE BEEN GIVEN OUT TO THE
WORKERS IN PYONGYANG, ALTHOUGH FOREIGNERS IN PYONGYANG
CONTINUE TO HAVE DIFFICULTY FINDING ANY NORTH KOREAN

SOMEWHAT GREATER TOLERANCE FOR OPPOSITION POLITICAL ACTIVITY BEGINNING IN THE PERIOD LEADING UP TO PRESIDENT CARTER'S VISIT IN JUNE HAVE LED TO MORE POLITICAL UNREST IN
SOUTH KOREA THAN HAS BEEN VISIBLE IN SOME TIME. THE
GOVERNMENT IS WELL AWARE OF THE POLITICAL SIGNIFICANCE
OF INFLATION AND ITS ANTIDOTES, AND CAN BE EXPECTED TO MANAGE THE SITUATION WITH PRUDENCE AND SKILL. DESPITE EXTREMELY TIGHT MONEY, THE GROWTH RATE IN 1979 WILL ABOUT 8
IN REAL TERMS.
IN 1979 THE CONSUMER PRICE INDEX HAS INCREASED MORE THAN
20 ON AN ANNUAL BASIS. TO COMBAT THIS PRESSURE THE
ROKG HAS ADOPTED TRADITIONAL ANTI-INFLATION MEASURES AND
APPLIED THEM WITH DETERMINATION: MONEY SUPPLY GROWTH
HAS BEEN HELD TO A MINIMUM, THE CENTRAL GOVERNMENT HAS
RUN A SUBSTANTIAL SURPLUS, AND IMPORTS HAVE BEEN LIBERALIZED. WHILE THESE MEASURES HAVE SQUEEZED MOST OF THE
NON-FUEL PRICE INFLATION OUT OF THE SYSTEM, EACH HAS HAD
ITS UNPLEASANT SIDE EFFECTS: MORE BUSINESS FAILURES,
POSTPONED SOCIAL PROJECTS AND A 1979 CURRENT ACCOUNT DEFICIT WHICH MAY REACH $6 BILLION. NEVERTHELESS, KOREA'S
BASIC ECONOMIC STRENGTHS - AN EDUCATED, DISCIPLINED AND

TYPICALLY, HUMAN RIGHTS PROGRESS IN 1979 HAS BEEN UNEVEN.
FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE KIM TAE CHUNG WAS RELEASED
FROM PRISON IN DECEMBER, BUT HAS SUBSEQUENTLY BEEN SUBJECT TO HOUSE ARREST FOR EXTENDED PERIODS. GREATER PRESS
FREEDOM HAS BEEN EVIDENT, AND A NEW, MORE CONFRONTIVE
OPPOSITION LEADER, KIM YONG-SAM, WAS CHOSEN, WHO LATER
LOST HIS POSITION IN A COURT CHALLENGE. SOME 139 POLITICAL PRISONERS HAVE BEEN RELEASED SINCE LATE JULY AND A

BEEN SOME NEW ARRESTS FOR CRITICISM OF THE GOVERNMENT. IN
ANY EVENT, THE LEGAL MACHINERY WHICH HAS ENABLED THE GOVERNMENT TO USE REPRESSIVE TACTICS REMAINS INTACT.
US-KOREA RELATIONS HAVE IMPROVED DRAMATICALLY IN 1979.
KOREAGATE IS PAST, PRESIDENT CARTER HAS SUSPENDED, AT
LEAST UNTIL A REVIEW IN 1981, HIS PROGRAM FOR THE WITHDRAWAL OF U.S. GROUND COMBAT FORCES, AND THERE HAS BEEN
SOME TENTATIVE IMPROVEMENT IN THE HUMAN RIGHTS CLIMATE. THE
IMPROVEMENT IN THE OVERALL RELATIONSHIP WAS SYMBOLIZED
BY PRESIDENT CARTER'S VISIT TO SEOUL JUNE 29-JULY 1.
THE JULY 20 DECISION TO SUSPEND FURTHER TROOP WITHDRAWALS
WAS PROMPTED IN PART BY REVISED INTELLIGENCE ESTIMATES
OF NORTH KOREAN MILITARY STRENGTH WHICH SHOWED THAT GROUND
FORCES, ARMOR, FIREPOWER AND MOBILITY WERE ALL GREATER
THAN PREVIOUSLY BELIEVED. THE TIMING AND PACE OF FURTHER
WITHDRAWALS WILL BE RE-EXAMINED IN 1981. THAT RE-EXAMINATION WILL FOCUS ON THE RESTORATION OF A SATISFACTORY NORTHSOUTH M;LITARY BALANCE AND EVIDENCE OF TANGIBLE PROGRESS
TOWARD A REDUCTION OF TENSIONS ON THE PENINSULA. THE
SUSPENSION WAS WELCOMED IN SEOUL, TOKYO AND ELSEWHERE IN
ASIA AS EVIDENCE OF THE U.S. COMMITMENT TO THE SECURITY
OF THE REGION AND FLEXIBILITY IN THE FACE OF CHANGED CIRCUMSTANCES.

NORMALIZATION AND TWO WEEKS BEFORE THE VISIT TO WASHINGTON
OF CHINESE DEPUTY PREMIER TENG, EFFECTIVELY PRECLUDED
NORTH KOREAN IMMEDIATE FLAT REJECTION, A POSITION THEY HAD
TAKEN ON SEOUL'S EARLIER CALLS FOR GOVERNMENT-TO-GOVERNMENT DIALOGUE. NORTH KOREA'S FAVORABLE RESPONSE CAME
SEVERAL DAYS LATER AND TWO MEETINGS OF &quot;LIAISON REPRESENTATIVES&quot; OF THE NORTH AND SOUTH DID TAKE PLACE AT PANMUNJOM IN MARCH, BUT THESE EFFORTS BROKE DOWN WHEN THE
NORTH PROVED RESOLUTE IN OPPOSITION TO MEETING BILATERALLY
WITH THE ROKG, PREFERRING A KOREAN MULTI-PARTY FORMAT
IN WHICH THE ROKG WOULD BE BUT ONE ELEMENT. PYONGYANG'S
INSISTENCE ON THIS MULTILATERAL APPROACH WOULD: 1) DETRACT FROM THE LEGITIMACY OF THE ROKG; 2) PREVENT REAL
PROGRESS ON TENSION-REDUCING MEASURES; AND 3) ASSUMING
UNACCEPTABLE TO THE ROKG, LEAVE NORTH KOREA THE PROPAGANDA ROLE OF INITIATOR AND WILLING PARTY FOR PAN-KOREAN
DISCUSSIONS. WHILE BOTH PYONGYANG AND SEOUL PROBABLY
LOST IMAGE IN THE COURT OF WORLD OPINION FOR PROVING UNABLE TO HAVE MORE THAN TWO SHORT MEETINGS AT PANMUNJOM,
NORTH KOREA HAS LOST FURTHER IMAGE WHILE SEOUL HAS GAINED
CONSIDERABLY AS PRESIDENTS CARTER AND PARK PROPOSED IN
JULY TRILATERAL MEETINGS OF GOVERNMENT REPRESENTATIVES
OF THE DPRK, ROK, AND US. WE HAD MADE THIS PROPOSAL IN
EARNEST TO LOOK FOR WAYS IN WHICH TENSIONS MIGHT BE REDUCED AND UNDERSTANDING BUILT UP, BUT NORTH KOREA HAS RESPONDED NEGATIVELY TO DATE. THE NORTH KOREAN RESPONSE HAS
BEEN THAT THERE ARE TWO DISTINCT ISSUES WHICH MUST BE
TREATED IN SEPARATE CONFERENCES. ACCORDING TO THE DPRK,
THE QUESTION OF KOREAN REUNIFICATION CAN HAVE ONLY KOREAN
PARTIES PRESENT, BUT PYONGYANG REFUSES TO SIT DOWN BILATERALLY WITH SEOUL. PYONGYANG'S LEGALISTIC POSITION ON
MILITARY QUESTIONS IS THAT ONLY THE U.S. SIGNED THE
KOREAN ARMISTICE AND IS THEREFORE SOLELY ELIGIBLE TO DISCUSS THESE QUESTIONS WITH PYONGYANG (NORTH KOREA'S POSITION HAS SHOWN SOME FLEX IN ALLOWING SEOUL AS AN &quot;OBSERVER&quot;

PARTICIPANT IN ANY DISCUSSIONS FROM THE OUTSET).
NEITHER WE NOR THE SOUTH KOREANS HAVE CLOSED THE DOOR ON

VIII. THE SITUATION IN AFGHANISTAN
INTERNAL
HAFIZULLAH AMIN CAPPED HIS SEVENTEEN-MONTH RISE TO POWER
ON SEPTEMBER 16 BY ADDING NOOR MOHAMMAD TARAKI'S POSITIONS
AS PRESIDENT OF THE REVOLUTIONARY COUNCIL AND SECRETARY
GENERAL OF THE PEOPLE'S DEMOCRATIC PARTY (PDPA) TO HIS
PREVIOUS JOBS AS PRIME MINISTER AND ACTING DEFENSE MINISTER. IN THE PROCESS, HOWEVER, HE HAS NARROWED THE BASE
OF SUPPORT FOR HIS REGIME AND COULD FACE CHALLENGES BOTH
FROM WITHIN THE PDPA AND FROM THE MILITARY. HE ALSO
CONFRONTS A CONTINUING INSURGENCY WHICH HAS SUCCESSFULLY
DENIED TO THE GOVERNMENT CONTROL OVER SUBSTANTIAL AREAS
OF THE AFGHAN COUNTRYSIDE. MILITARY MORALE HAS DETERIORATED AND COMBAT UNITS ARE PLAGUED BY SEVERE MANPOWER PROBLEMS BROUGHT ABOUT THROUGH CASUALTIES, DEFECTIONS, DESERTIONS, MUTINIES, AND CONTINUING PURGES OF THE OFFICER
CORPS.
AMIN IS ATTEMPTING TO GIVE HIS REGIME A NEW IMAGE OF
SECRET
SECRET
PAGE 47

STATE 263929

MODERATION, LEGALITY AND JUSTICE AS HE SEEKS TO CONSOLIDATE HIS POWER, BUT HIS IDENTIFICATION WITH PAST DRA POLICIES, INCLUDING A DEPLORABLE HUMAN RIGHTS RECORD, MAY
LIMIT THE CREDIBILITY AND APPEAL OF THIS MORE CONCILIATORY
APPROACH. HE IS ALSO LIKELY TO CONFRONT INCREASING ECONOMIC PROBLEMS AS DEVELOPMENT SLOWS AND OTHER DISLOCATIONS
DUE TO THE INSRUGENCY RESULT IN SHORTAGES AND PRICE RISES.
SOVIET INVOLVEMENT
THE SOVIET ROLE AS A KEY PROP TO THE AFGHAN REGIME HAS
GROWN OVER THE PAST YEAR. HOWEVER, WE HAVE NO EVIDENCE
THEY ENGINEERED RECENT CHANGES IN KABUL AND A NUMBER OF
INDICATIONS THEY WERE PROBABLY CAUGHT BY SURPRISE.
WE NOW ESTIMATE THAT THERE ARE BETWEEN 2,500 AND 3,500
SOVIET MILITARY ADVISERS AND PERHAPS 3,000 CIVILIAN
ADVISERS IN AFGHANISTAN. ADVISERS ARE POSTED THROUGHOUT
THE AFGHAN MILITARY AT LEAST DOWN TO THE BATTALION LEVEL
AND AT WORKING LEVELS IN THE CIVILIAN BUREAUCRACY. WITHIN
THE MILITARY, SOVIET ADVISERS PLAY KEY ROLES, INCLUDING
SOME COMMAND AND CONTROL FUNCTIONS. THERE ARE NUMEROUS

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
REPORTS, WHICH WE CAN NEITHER CONFIRM NOR DISPROVE, THAT
SOVIET PERSONNEL HAVE FLOWN AT LEAST SOME COMBAT MISSIONS
FOR THE AFGHAN AIR FORCE. SOVIETS ARE PROBABLY PROVIDING
SECURITY AT BAGRAM AIR BASE AND PERHAPS AT SOME LOCATIONS
IN KABUL. IN ADDITION TO THEIR EXTENSIVE ADVISORY ROLE,
THE SOVIETS HAVE PROVIDED SUBSTANTIAL MILITARY AID, INCLUDING MIG-21'S, TANKS, ARMORED PERSONNEL CARRIERS, AND
MI-24 ASSAULT HELICOPTERS. THERE ARE ALSO UNCONFIRMED
REPORTS OF THE USE OF NAPALM ON AFGHAN VILLAGES.
THERE WERE SIGNS OF INCREASED SOVIET MILITARY ACTIVITY
NORTH OF THE USSR-AFGHANISTAN BORDER COINCIDENT WITH
THE SEPTEMBER 14-16 EVENTS IN KABUL WHICH RESULTED IN
AMIN'S REPLACEMENT OF TARAKI. WE COULD NOT BE CERTAIN
SECRET
SECRET
PAGE 48

STATE 263929

ABOUT THE PURPOSE OF THIS ACTIVITY WHICH COULD HAVE BEEN
ASSOCIATED WITH CONTINGENCY PLANNING FOR POSSIBLE SOVIET
INTERVENTION TO SECURE PERSONNEL OR INSTALLATIONS OR MORE
DIRECT SOVIET INVOLVEMENT IN THE POLITICAL SCENE. WE REMAIN CONCERNED THAT THE SOVIETS COULD BE TEMPTED TO TAKE
A MORE DIRECT ROLE IN THE AFGHAN CIVIL WAR, ESPECIALLY
IF THE VOLATILE ENVIRONMENT IN KABUL SHOULD LEAD TO
CLASHES BETWEEN OPPOSING MILITARY ELEMENTS OR CIVIL UNREST.
AFGHAN FOREIGN POLICY
AFGHANISTAN HAS CLEARLY POSITIONED ITSELF AMONG THE MOST
RADICAL OF THE NONALIGNED STATES, TAKING POSITIONS GENERALLY SUPPORTIVE OF MOSCOW'S INTERESTS. INDO-AFGHAN RELATIONS
REMAIN GENERALLY GOOD ALTHOUGH THE INDIANS PRIVATELY
EXHIBIT CONCERN OVER THE SOVIET ROLE IN AFGHANISTAN.
AFGHANISTAN'S RELATIONS WITH ITS OTHER NEIGHBORS -- PAKISTAN, IRAN AND CHINA -- ARE STRAINED. WITH PAKISTAN THE
SITUATION IS COMPLICATED BY THE EXODUS OF ALMOST 200,000
AFGHAN REFUGEES INTO PAKISTAN AND THE PRESENCE OF SEVERAL
COMPETING REBEL GROUPS IN THE BORDER AREAS OF PAKISTAN.
U.S.-AFGHAN RELATIONS CONTINUE TO BE COOL; SECURITY CONCERNS REQUIRED US TO EVACUATE OFFICIAL DEPENDENTS AND NONESSENTIAL EMPLOYEES FROM OUR EMBASSY IN MID-SUMMER.
THE PROGNOSIS
THE HIGHLY VOLATILE POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT IN KABUL COULD
LEAVE TO MILITARY OR INTERNAL PARTY CHALLENGES TO PRESIDENT AMIN. SUCH OPPOSITION FROM WITHIN WOULD REPRESENT
A SERIOUS THREAT, ESPECIALLY IF ONE OR MORE OF THE MILISECRET

TARY OFFICERS OUSTED FROM THE CABINET ON SEPTEMBER 14
(E.G.WATANJAR, MAZDOORYAR) ARE AT LARGE. AT THE SAME
TIME, INSURGENTS REMAIN ACTIVE IN THE COUNTRYSIDE BUT
WITHOUT ANY AGREED-UPON LEADERSHIP OR PROGRAM. THEY
HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO UNITE OR TO COORDINATE MILITARY ACTIVITIES. HOWEVER, THEY WILL CONTINUE TO SAP THE STRENGTH
OF THE AFGHAN ARMY WHOSE LOYALTY AND WILLINGNESS TO FIGHT
ARE ESSENTIAL TO THE REGIME'S SURVIVAL. ADDITIONAL MUTINIES AND LARGE-SCALE DEFECTIONS COULD LEAD TO FURTHER
UNRAVELING OF THE ARMY AND PERHAPS STIMULATE MILITARY
CHALLENGES TO THE AMIN REGIME. THE SOVIETS ARE FACED
WITH A CONTINUING DILEMMA OF HOW EXTENSIVELY THEY SHOULD
GET INVOLVED WITH A REGIME WHICH FACES A GENERALLY HOSTILE
POPULATION CONCERNED ABOUT ITS ANTI-ISLAMIC AND PRO-SOVIET
CHARACTER. ANY PROGNOSIS MUST ANTICIPATE FURTHER TURMOIL
AND PERHAPS SIGNIFICANT ADDITIONAL POLITICAL CHANGES.
DURING THE COMING WINTER BOTH SIDES IN THE INTERNAL
CONFLICT WILL HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO REGROUP FOR WHAT
COULD BE PROLONGED STRIFE.
IX. THE SITUATION IN INDIA AND PAKISTAN
INDIA
TWO DEVELOPMENTS DURING THE PAST YEAR WILL HAVE A MAJOR
IMPACT ON INDIA'S FUTURE -- THE CALL FOR GENERAL ELECTIONS AND HEIGHTENED INTERNATIONAL CONCERN ABOUT PAKISTAN'S NUCLEAR ACTIVITES.
AT THIS POINT, IT STILL IS TOO EARLY TO PREDICT THE OUTCOME OF INDIA'S GENERAL ELECTIONS, NOW EXPECTED TO BE HELD
IN DECEMBER. ALTHOUGH MOST OBSERVERS PREDICT MRS. GANDHI
WILL BE THE MAJOR GAINER, AT THIS TIME FEW PEOPLE EXPECT
HER TO EMERGE WITH AN ABSOLUTE MAJORITY.
THE ELECTIONS ARE QUICKLY TURNING INTO A THREE-WAY CONSECRET
SECRET

STATE 263929

TEST AND SEEM TO BE TURNING MORE ON RIVAL PERSONALITIES-I.E., PRIME MINISTERIAL CONTENDERS -- THAN IN ANY PREVIOUS
INDIAN RACE. IN ONE CORNER IS MRS. CANDHI, WHO IS PROJECTING AN IMAGE AS THE SOLE LEADER TO RESTORE POLITICAL
AND ECONOMIC STABILITY TO THE COUNTRY. THE SECOND MAJOR
FORCE IS THE JANATA PARTY, NOW UNDER THE LEADERSHIP OF
FORMER DEFENSE MINISTER JAGJIVAN RAM. THE JANATA HAS

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
APPEARED UNCERTAIN ABOUT HOW TO PITCH ITS POPULAR APPEAL.
ITS ESSENTIALLY NEGATIVE APPROACH REFLECTS ITS BRIEF
HISTORY; IT STANDS AGAINST DICTATORSHIP AND DEFECTIONS.
SOME PREDICT THAT AT THE PROPER MOMENT RAM -- NOTED AS A
MASTER OF POLITICAL TIMING -- WILL THROW HIS SUPPORT TO
MRS. CANDHI AND LEAVE BEHIND THE NOW-DOMINANT JANA SANGH
GROUP IN JANATA. (HIS PRIZE FOR DOING SO WOULD BE THE
PRIME MINISTERSHIP.)
THE THIRD MAJOR FORCE IS THE ALLIANCE OF CARETAKER PRIME
MINISTER CHARAN SINGH AND HIS JANATA-S PARTY, THE OLDLINE CONGRESS PARTY (NOW UNDER THE LEADERSHIP OF DEVRAJ
URS), AND THE FIVE LEFTIST AND COMMUNIST PARTIES THAT
HAVE ALLIED WITH THEM. SINGH'S APPEAL IS TO CASTE AND
RURAL ELEMENTS. DESPITE HIS ALLIANCES, HE ALSO IS RUNNING
AGAINST THIRTY YEARS OF NEHRUVIAN POLICIES THAT FAVORED
INDUSTRIAL OVER AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT, THE URBAN POPULATION OVER THE RURAL, AND THE UPPER AND LOWER CASTES
OVER THE INCREASINGLY VOCAL MIDDLE CLASSES.
POSSIBLE INDIAN REACTION TO PAKISTANI NUCLEAR ACTIVITIES
REPRESENTS THE SECOND MAJOR QUESTION MARK IN INDIA'S
FUTURE. TO DATE, MOST INDIANS HAVE REACTED RATHER CALMLY
TO INFORMATION THAT PAKISTAN IS SEEKING TO DEVELOP A
NUCLEAR EXPLOSIVE CAPABILITY. SOME HAVE EVEN GONE SO
FAR AS TO SAY THAT THE US IS PLAYING UP PAKISTANI ACTIVISECRET
SECRET
PAGE 51

STATE 263929

TIES IN ORDER TO FORCE INDIA TO ACCEPT SAFEGUARDS ON ALL
OF ITS NUCLEAR ACTIVITIES OR TO PAVE THE WAY TO JUSTIFY
FUTURE ARMS SALES TO PAKISTAN. OVER THE LONG RUN, HOWEVER,
INDIAN REACTION MAY BE QUITE DIFFERENT, AND OUR CONCERN
THAT A CONTINUED PAKISTANI PUSH FOR AN EXPLOSIVE CAPABILITY COULD REVIVE THE INDIAN EXPLOSIVES PROGRAM AND
SET OFF A NUCLEAR RACE IN THE SUBCONTINENT IS VERY REAL.
PAKISTAN
THE POLITICAL SITUATION IS TENSE AS PAKISTAN PREPARES FOR
NATIONAL ELECTIONS SCHEDULED FOR NOVEMBER 17. IF HELD
THESE ELECTIONS WOULD RETURN THE COUNTRY TO CIVILIAN RULE.
PARTY REGISTRAION WAS TO HAVE BEEN COMPLETED SEPTEMBER 30,
HOWEVER ONLY ONE MAJOR PARTY REGISTERED FOR THE ELECTION.
IT IS NOT AT ALL CLEAR HOW AN ELECTION CAN BE HELD IF
MOST OF THE MAJOR PARTIES REFUSE TO PARTICIPATE.
THE MAJOR POLITICAL PARTY IN PAKISTAN IS THE PAKISTAN
PEOPLE'S PARTY (PPP), HEADED BY NUSRAT BHUTTO, THE WIDOW
OF THE LATE PRIME MINISTER. IN LOCAL ELECTIONS HELD IN

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
LATE SEPTEMBER THE PPP WON IMPRESSIVE VICTORIES IN THREE
OF THE COUNTRY'S FOUR PROVINCES. IF PRESIDENT ZIA DETERMINES THAT THE PPP WOULD WIN A NATIONAL ELECTION, HE MIGHT
TRY TO CANCEL THE ELECTION OR AT LEAST SLIP THE DATE.
HOWEVER SUCH A MOVE COULD CAUSE CONSIDERABLE UNREST AND
VIOLENCE POSSIBLY LEADING TO COUP ATTEMPTS.
PAKISTAN HAS FOR A LONG TIME WISHED TO JOIN THE NON-ALIGNED MOVEMENT. THE COLLAPSE OF CENTO REMOVED THE LAST
BARRIER TO NAM MEMBERSHIP AND PAKISTAN WAS OFFICIAL
ANNOINTED AT THE RECENT HAVANA CONFERENCE. RELATIONS
WITH AFGHANISTAN REMAIN SEVERELY TROUBLED AND ARE COMPLICATED BY ABOUT 200,000 AFGHAN REFUGEES WHO ARE NOW RESIDING IN PAKISTAN. THE GOVERNMENT OF PAKISTAN BELIEVES
SECRET
SECRET
PAGE 52

STATE 263929

THAT AFGHANISTAN FOR ALL PRACTICAL PURPOSES HAS BECOME
A SOVIET SATELLITE AND REPRESENTS A SERIOUS LONG-TERM
SECURITY THREAT. PAKISTAN IS ALSO CONCERNED OVER THE
CHAOTIC SITUATION IN IRAN, BUT IS ON GOOD TERMS WITH THIS
NEIGHBORING ISLAMIC COUNTRY. PAKISTAN'S RELATIONS WITH
THE USSR REMAIN COOL BUT CORRECT.
- X. USSR AND PRC FOREIGN POLICY IN EASTERN AND SOUTHERN ASIA
SOVIET FOREIGN POLICY
THE SOVIET UNION CONTINUES TO DEFINE ITS FOREIGN POLICY
TOWARD ASIA LARGELY IN TERMS OF OPPOSITION TO THE PEOPLE'S
REPUBLIC OF CHINA. MOSCOW'S OVERRIDING PREOCCUPATION WITH
CONTAINMENT OF THE CHINESE THREAT, BOTH REAL AND POTENTIAL,
COLORS ITS RELATIONS WITH NORTH ASIAN STATES AND PROVIDES
THE BASIC JUSTIFICATION FOR A GROWING SOVIET MILITARY PRESENCE IN THE NORTHERN PACIFIC. IT ALSO PROVIDES THE MOTIVE FORCE BEHIND MOSCOW'S EFFORT TO EXPAND ITS INFLUENCE
IN SOUTHEAST ASIA BY PROVIDING UNQUALIFIED POLITICAL AND
MILITARY SUPPORT TO VIETNAM.
CHINA
ON APRIL 3, CHINA ANNOUNCED ITS DECISION NOT TO RENEW ITS
THIRTY-YEAR OLD TREATY OF FRIENDSHIP, ALLIANCE AND MUTUAL
ASSISTANCE WITH THE USSR. THE ACTION WAS EXPECTED SINCE
VICE PREMIER DENG HAD PROMISED THE JAPANESE (IN THE CONTEXT OF NEGOTIATIONS ON THE SINO-JAPANESE PEACE AND FRIENDSHIP TREATY) THAT HE WOULD ALLOW THE TREATY TO EXPIRE.
HOWEVER, BEIJING'S SIMULTANEOUS CALL FOR NEW SINO-SOVIET

NEGOTIATIONS, AND MOSCOW'S SUBSEQUENT ACCEPTANCE, SET THE
STAGE FOR THE FIRST BROAD-BASED POLITICAL NEGOTIATIONS
BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES IN NEARLY TWO DECADES.
AFTER FIVE MONTHS OF PREPARATIONS, THE SOVIET-CHINESE
TALKS OPENED IN MOSCOW ON SEPTEMBER 27. ALTHOUGH THE
AGENDA WAS NOT SET IN ADVANCE, BOTH SIDES DID INDICATE
INTEREST IN PRODUCING A NEW POLITICAL DOCUMENT SETTING
FORTH THE &quot;BASIC PRINCIPLES&quot; OF SOVIET-CHINESE RELATIONS
IN TERMS CALCULATED TO REDUCE TENSIONS. THEY ALSO EXPRESSED A MUTUAL WILLINGNESS TO CONSIDER INCREASED COMMERCIAL,
SCIENTIFIC AND CULTURAL EXCHANGES AND A GENERAL IMPROVEMENT IN THEIR BILATERAL CONTACTS.
THERE IS LITTLE POSSIBILITY, HOWEVER, THAT THE MOSCOW
TALKS WILL RESULT IN ANY SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT IN SOVIETCHINESE RELATIONS. DEEP SEATED ANIMOSITIES DIVIDE THE TWO
COUNTRIES, WHILE OFFICIALS ON BOTH SIDES HAVE TAKEN PAINS
TO HOLD DOWN EXPECTATIONS. GIVEN A PRIOR AGREEMENT TO CONSIDER THE EXPLOSIVE TOPIC OF &quot;HEGEMONY&quot; AND CHINESE INTENTIONS TO DISCUSS &quot;KAMPUCHEA&quot; AND THE SOVIET-CHINESE
BORDER, THE TALKS COULD DEGENERATE INTO THE KIND OF SHOUTING MATCHES THAT HAVE CHARACTERIZED CHINA'S NEGOTIATIONS
WITH VIETNAM. MORE LIKELY, HOWEVER, THE TALKS WILL BE
PROLONGED WITH BOTH SIDES TRYING TO APPEAR REASONABLE
ENOUGH TO OBTAIN MAXIMUM POLITICAL AND PROPAGANDA ADVANTAGE.
FOR THE SOVIETS, THE TALKS WILL ALLOW THEM TO PRESENT
THEIR CASE AGAINST CHINA AND, HOPEFULLY, MITIGATE CHINESE
PRESSURE AGAINST VIETNAM. HOWEVER, MOSCOW WILL NOT ALTER
ITS RELATIONSHIP WITH HANOI OR MAKE CHANGES IN ITS MILITARY POSTURE ON THE BORDER. THE SOVIETS MAY ALSO SEE
NEGOTIATIONS WITH CHINA AS PROVIDING SOME LEVERAGE IN
THEIR RELATIONSHIP WITH THE U.S. AND AS A MEANS OF RETARDING THE DEVELOPMENT OF US-CHINESE RELATIONS.

CONTEXT, MOSCOW CONCLUDED THE SOVIET-VIETNAMESE FRIEND-

SHIP TREATY IN NOVEMBER 1978, SUPPORTED HANOI'S INVASION
OF KAMPUCHEA, RECOGNIZED THE HENG SAMRIN REGIME, AND SUPPORTED VIETNAMESE TIGHTENING OF ITS CONTROL IN LAOS.
DURING THE SINO-VIETNAMESE WAR, THE SOVIETS INITIATIED
AIR AND SEA LIFT OF MILITARY SUPPLIES, STATIONED A FLOTILLA OF NAVAL VESSELS OFF THE VIETNAMESE COAST, AND LAUNCHED
A VICIOUS PROPAGANDA CAMPAIGN AGAINST CHINA.
ALREADY THIS YEAR, THE SOVIET UNION HAS SUPPLIED VIETNAM
WITH SEVERAL TIMES THE AMOUNT OF MILITARY EQUIPMENT IT
DID IN 1978. SOVIET AIRCRAFT ARE TRANSFERRING MILITARY
SUPPLIES INSIDE VIETNAM AND INTO LAOS AND KAMPUCHEA.
SOVIET NAVAL VESSELS HAVE CALLED AT CAM RANH BAY AND
RECONNAISSANCE AIRCRAFT HAVE PERIODICALLY DEPLOYED TO
VIETNAM.
AT THE SAME TIME SOVIET MEDIA HAVE SOUGHT TO DEFLECT INTERNATIONAL CRITICISM OF VIETNAMESE ACTIONS IN KAMPUCHEA
AND ITS EXPULSION OF HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF REFUGEES.
MOSCOW CAN NOW BE EXPECTED TO CONTINUE THIS DUAL POLICY
OF PROTECTING HANOI IN INTERNATIONAL FORA, WHILE SUPPLYING
THE MILITARY MEANS FOR REALIZING ITS AMBITIONS IN INDOCHINA. EFFORTS TO SEAT THE HENG SAMRIN REGIME AT INTERNATIONAL MEETINGS WILL THUS BE COUPLED WITH THE HOPE THAT
VIETNAM'S DRY SEASON OFFENSIVE WILL FINISH POL POT AND
HAND CHINA A MAJOR DEFEAT IN KAMPUCHEA.

ON THE REFUGEE QUESTION, THE SOVIETS WILL MAINTAIN THEIR
CLAIM THAT THE US AND CHINA ARE USING THIS ISSUE TO PRESSURE HANOI AND AS AN EXCUSE TO STATION US NAVAL UNITSIN
VIETNAMESE WATERS. MOSCOW WILL NOT CONTRIBUTE TO INTERNATIONAL RELIEF EFFORTS OR ACCOMMODATE REQUESTS THAT IT
INFLUENCE HANOI TO CONTROL THE OUTFLOW OF REFUGEES.
IN RETURN, THE SOVIETS WILL PRESS FOR INCREASED USE OF
VIETNAMESE MILITARY FACILITIES. SINCE HANOI'S CURRENT
OFFENSIVE IN KAMPUCHEA INCREASES THE DANGER OF RENEWED
CHINESE HOSTILITIES, IT WILL HAVE LITTLE OPTION BUT TO
REMAIN DEPENDENT ON SOVIET SUPPORT THUS ENHANCING MOSCOW'S
LEVERAGE ON HANOI. SHOULD THE CHINESE DECIDE TO &quot;TEACH
VIETNAM A SECOND LESSON,&quot; THE SOVIETS ARE AGAIN MOST
LIKELY TO AID THE VIETNAMESE IN VIETNAM. HOWEVER, THEY
HAVE BEEN CAREFUL NOT TO RULE OUT THE POSSIBILITY OF DIRECT COUNTER ACTION ON THE SOVIET-CHINESE BORDER.

SINCE THE ADVENT OF THE OHIRA GOVERNMENT IN DECEMBER, 1978,
THE SOVIETS HAVE ATTEMPTED TO REFURBISH THEIR RELATIONS
WITH JAPAN AND IMPROVE THEIR TIES WITH A BROAD SPECTRUM
OF JAPANESE POLITICAL FIGURES. THESE EFFORTS PEAKED IN
MAY DURING THE VISIT OF SOVIET VICE FOREIGN MINISTER
FIRYUBIN TO TOKYO. WHILE IT PRODUCED FEW SURPRISES,
THE VISIT WAS THE FIRST BY A RANKING SOVIET OFFICIAL FOLLOWING THE SIGNING OF THE SINO-JAPANESE PEACE AND FRIENDSHIP TREATY AND BOTH SIDES WERE PLEASED THAT IT TOOK PLACE.
MOSCOW'S EFFORT FOR A RETURN TO NORMALCY WAS ENHANCED BY
THE DISSIPATION OF JAPAN'S &quot;CHINA EUPHORIA&quot; FOLLOWING
BEIJING'S &quot;REAPPRAISAL&quot; OF SEVERAL LARGE EXPORT CONTRACTS
AND BE SHOCK FELT IN JAPAN OVER CHINA'S INVASION OF VIETNAM.

SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN SOVIET-JAPANESE RELATIONS CONTINUED TO BE CHECKED, HOWEVER, BY SOVIET UNWILLINGNESS
TO CONSIDER THE RETURN OF THE &quot;NORTHERN TERRITORIES&quot; TO
JAPAN. PUBLIC DISCLOSURE OF A SOVIET MILITARY BUILDUP
ON THE FOUR ISLANDS NORTH OF HOKKAIDO AND FOREIGN MINISTER
SONODA'S SEPTEMBER VISIT TO THE AREA HAVE AGAIN FOCUSSED
JAPANESE ATTENTION ON MOSCOW'S INTRANSIGENCE. THE SOVIETS REACTED NEGATIVELY TO JAPAN'S SUSPENSION OF ECONOMIC
AID TO HANOI FOLLOWING THE KAMPUCHEA INVASION AND TO
JAPANESE CRITICISM OF SOVIET UTILIZATION OF VIETNAMESE
MILITARY FACILITIES. TOKYO'S EXPANDING RELATIONS WITH
BEIJING BROUGHT SOVIET MEDIA CHARGES OF AN EMERGING &quot;USCHINESE-JAPANESE ALLIANCE&quot; AGAINST THE SOVIET UNION.
KOREA
US-SOUTH KOREAN PROPOSALS FOR TRIPARTITE TALKS ON A KOREAN
PEACE SETTLEMENT TRIGGERED NEW SOVIET INTEREST IN PENINSULA AFFAIRS AND NEW SIGNS OF MOSCOW'S INTEREST IN IMPROVING SOVIET-NORTH KOREAN RELATIONS. FOLLOWING PYONGYANG'S
LEAD, MOSCOW DENOUNCED THE PROPOSAL AND ACCUSED CHINA OF
COOPERATING WITH US IMPERIALISM IN &quot;FIXING THE DIVISION
OF KOREA.&quot; A POLITBURO LEVEL NORTH KOREAN PARTY DELEGATION VISITED MOSCOW IN JUNE AND THE SOVIET-NORTH KOREAN
JOINT ECONOMIC COMMISSION MET THIS SUMMER FOR THE FIRST
TIME IN TWO YEARS. IN RESPONSE, MESSAGES FROM PYONGYANG
HAVE HINTED AT NORTH KOREAN INTEREST IN BETTER TIES WITH
THE SOVIETS.
DESPITE PYONGYANG'S PRESENT &quot;TILT&quot; TOWARD CHINA, NORTH
KOREA REMAINS A VALUABLE SOVIET ASSET IN NORTHEAST ASIA.

AS A RESULT, MOSCOW HAS BEEN CAUTIOUS IN ITS CONTACTS
WITH SOUTH KOREA FOR FEAR OF DRIVING THE NORTH EVEN
FURTHER INTO THE CHINESE CAMP. IN THE PAST YEAR, THE
SOVIETS HAVE WELCOMED SOUTH KOREAN REPRESENTATIVES TO
INTERNATIONAL MEETINGS HELD IN THE USSR, BUT HAVE STOPPED
SHORT OF DIRECT COMMERCIAL OR POLITICAL CONTACTS WITH
SEOUL FOR FEAR OF FURTHER ALIENATING PYONGYANG. THIS
PRACTICE CAN BE EXPECTED TO CONTINUE.
IN THE FUTURE, SOVIET EFFORTS TO IMPROVE THEIR RELATIONS
WITH NORTH KOREA WILL CONTINUE TO BE RESTRAINED BY MOSCOW'S UNWILLINGNESS TO DISTURB THE STATUS QUO ON THE
PENINSULA. MAJOR DELIVERIES OF SOVIET MILITARY EQUIPMENT
CEASED IN 1973. RESUMPTION OF SOVIET MILITARY ASSISTANCE,
ESPECIALLY THE DELIVERY OF ADVANCED AIRCRAFT, WOULD PROVIDE A MAJOR FILLIP TO RELATIONS, BUT WOULD RISK GIVING
KIM IL-SONG THE MEANS TO LAUNCH A NEW KOREAN WAR. THE
SOVIETS WILL CONTINUE TO PROVIDE POLITICAL SUPPORT FOR
KIM'S GOAL OF KOREAN UNIFICATION BUT WILL WORK TO ENSURE
THAT USSR PARTICIPATION IN THE PROCESS SO THAT NO SETTLEMENT WILL BE CONCLUDED AT SOVIET EXPENSE.

FLOW. THERE ARE NO SIGNS THAT CHINA HAS IMMINENT PLANS
TO &quot;TEACH VIETNAM A SECOND LESSON.&quot; RATHER THE PROSPECT
IS FOR A PROTRACTED STRUGGLE WITH CHINA APPLYING A MIX
OF PSYCHOLOGICAL AND GUERRILLA WARFARE PRESSURES ON THE
SRV ALONG THE SINO-INDOCHINA BORDER AND WITH PRC SUPPORTED POL POT AND LAO GUERRILLA FORCES MAINTAINING RESISTENCE IN KAMPUCHEA AND LAOS. THE PRC HOPES
THROUGH THESE TACTICS TO WEAR THE VIETNAMESE DOWN, TO
DISCOURAGE THEM FROM REALIZING THEIR AMBITIONS AND TO
ENHANCE ITS OWN ROLE IN THE AREA WHILE STALLING SOVIET
PENETRATION EFFORTS. ALTHOUGH ITS RESOURCES ARE
STRETCHED, WE EXPECT VIETNAM, WITH MAJOR SECURITY AND
ECONOMIC ASSISTANCE FROM THE SOVIET UNION TO KEEP UP
ITS RELENTLESS PURSUIT OF DOMINATION OVER INDOCHINA AND
THE LEADING ROLE IN SOUTHEAST ASIA. THUS, THE OUTLOOK
FOR ANY KIND OF POLITICAL SETTLEMENT IN KAMPUCHEA IN
THE NEAR FUTURE IS ALMOST NIL.
AN ENCOURAGING ASPECT OF SOUTHEAST ASIAN DEVELOPMENTS HAS BEEN THE INCREASING UNITY OF THE ASEAN
NATIONS IN FACE OF THE LATEST INDOCHINA CONVULSION.
WHILE MAINTAINING A STEADY COURSE TOWARD THEIR PRIME

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
GOAL OF STRENGTH AND STABILITY THROUGH ECONOMIC AND
SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT, THE ASEANS HAVE TAKEN A LEAD IN
STRONG JOINT STATEMENTS AND UN EFFORTS AGAINST VIETNAMESE ACTIONS, HAVE THUS FAR SUCCESSFULLY HANDLED
THE POLITICALLY DEVISIVE ASPECTS OF THE REFUGEE
PROBLEM,HAVE MODESTLY STEPPED UP THEIR
INDIVIDUAL SECURITY EFFORTS, AS WELL AS BILATERAL
AND TRILATERAL SECURITY COOPERATION,
AND MOST RECENTLY TURNED DOWN SOVIET REQUESTS FOR
NAVAL VISITS AT ASEAN PORTS. WITH A SUBSTANTIAL
ASSIST FROM THE EUROPEAN NATIONS, THE UNITED STATES
AND OTHERS, THE ASEAN NATIONS WON RELIEF

TORIUM ON THE OFFICIALLY SPONSORED EXODUS. THEY ALSO
WON AN IMPORTANT UNITED NATIONS VICTORY WHEN A LARGE
UNGA MAJORITY VOTED TO SEAT POL POT'S REPRESENTATIVES.
ASEAN IS NOT WITHOUT ITS PROBLEMS, HOWEVER. THE POSSIBILITY OF SPILLOVER OF THE INDOCHINA FIGHTING, THE
GROWING USSR/SRV RELATIONSHIP, INVOLVING INCREASED
SOVIET MILITARY PRESENCE IN VIETNAM, PLUS THE SPECTRE
OF A RENEWED DELUGE OF REFUGEES ALL WERE MATTERS OF
CONCERN. OIL PRICE INCREASES AND INFLATION ALSO ARE
AFFECTING ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND IN THE PHILIPPINES
ARE CONTRIBUTING TO DOMESTIC POLITICAL UNREST. ACCORDINGLY, WHILE THEIR OWN GROWTH AND UNIFYING EFFORTS
HAVE BEEN ENCOURAGING, THE ASEAN NATIONS CONTINUE TO
NEED AND SEEK SUPPORT FROM THE INDUSTRIALIZED NATIONS
IN A VARIETY OF AREAS.
IN CONTRAST TO THE DESTABILIZING TRENDS AMONG THE
COMMUNIST NATIONS IN SOUTHEAST ASIA, DEVELOPMENTS IN
NORTHEAST ASIA HAVE FOR THE MOST PART BEEN CONSTRUCTIVE. SUCCESSFUL NORMALIZATION OF US/PRC RELATIONS
HAS BEEN ACCOMPLISHED AT THE SAME TIME THE PRC HAS
MOVED DRAMATICALLY TOWARD A MORE PRAGMATIC AND OPEN
APPROACH TO BOTH ITS DOMESTIC DEVELOPMENT AND FOREIGN
POLICIES. THE SINO-JAPANESE PFT ADDS SUBSTANTIALLY
TO THE ENCOURAGING STRATEGIC TRENDS IN THE AREA.
OTHER MAJOR POSITIVE DEVELOPMENTS INCLUDE RESOLUTION
OF ECONOMIC DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND
JAPAN, THE ENLARGING WORLD POLITICAL ROLE BEING PLAYED
BY JAPAN AND RESOLUTION OF SECURITY AND POLITICAL ISSUES
BETWEEN THE US AND KOREA -- ALTHOUGH EARLY OCTOBER
POLITICAL DEVELOPMENTS IN SEOUL WERE REGRETTED IN

AND KOREA, INFLATION ADDS TO DOMESTIC POLITICAL CONCERNS IN THE ROK.
SOVIET AND NORTH KOREAN RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE REST OF
THE AREA ON THE OTHER HAND FAILED TO IMPROVE AND
PROSPECTS ARE NOT ENCOURAGING. THE NORTH KOREANS
REBUFFED A US/ROK OFFER OF TRIPARTITE TALKS, AND
WE SEE NO OPPORTUNITY AT THIS TIME TO BEGIN TO
RESOLVE THE DEEP NORTH/SOUTH KOREAN DIFFICULTIES.
THE SOVIET MILITARY BUILD-UP ON THE ISLANDS NORTH
OF HOKKAIDO CLAIMED BY JAPAN EXACERBATED THE COOL
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THESE TWO POWERS.
II. THE SITUATION IN THE INDOCHINESE PENINSULA
COMMITTED TO MILITARY SOLUTIONS WHEN NECESSARY TO
ACHIEVE ITS OBJECTIVES, HANOI INTENDS TO CONSOLIDATE
ITS DOMINANCE OVER INDOCHINA, STRENGTHEN ITS POSITION
VIS-A-VIS THE PRC AND EVENTUALLY BECOME THE DOMINANT
POWER IN SOUTHEAST ASIA. CHINA ON THE OTHER HAND, INTENDS TO EXERT SUSTAINED MILITARY AND PSYCHOLOGICAL
PRESSURE ON HANOI, TO COMPEL IT -- OVER SEVERAL YEARS
-- TO SHOW GREATER RESPECT FOR CHINESE POWER AND INTERESTS IN SOUTHEAST ASIA AND WEAKEN ITS TIES WITH MOSCOW.
AS A CONSEQUENCE, WHILE THE TWO CONTINUE TO HOLD TALKS,
THEIR OPPOSED AMBITIONS WILL CONTINUE TO GENERATE TENSION AND CONFRONTATION ALONG THE SINO-VIETNAMESE BORDER
AND IN KAMPUCHEA AND LAOS.
SINO-VIETNAMESE RELATIONS
CHINA AND VIETNAM REMAIN DEADLOCKED AFTER THEIR 12TH
NEGOTIATING SESSION IN BEIJING, AND NO PROGRESS SEEMS
LIKELY. DURING RECENT SESSIONS CHINA REPEATED ITS POSITION THAT THE ONLY LEGITIMATE KAMPUCHEAN GOVERNMENT IS
THE ONE HEADED BY POL POT. THE CHINESE ALSO PROMISED

TO AID THE ANTI-VIETNAMESE RESISTANCE IN KAMPUCHEA AS
LONG AS VIETNAM KEEPS ITS TROOPS THERE. THE CHINESE
HOLD OUT NO HOPE FOR BETTER RELATIONS WITH HANOI UNTIL
THE VIETNAMESE CEASE THEIR HOSTILE POLICIES TOWARD
CHINA, WITHDRAW FROM BOTH KAMPUCHEA AND LAOS, AND STOP
ARMED PROVOCATIONS ALONG THE BORDER. WHEREAS CHINA'S
STANCE IS BASED ON A BROAD INDICTMENT OF VIETNAM'S QUEST

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
FOR HEGEMONY IN INDOCHINA, VIETNAM'S POSITION IS THAT
SPECIFIC BILATERAL ISSUES, I.E., CESSATION OF BORDER PROVOCATIONS THROUGH CREATION OF A DEMILITARIZED ZONE,
SHOULD BE NEGOTIATED. VIETNAM REFUSES TO DISCUSS THE
SITUATION IN KAMPUCHEA AND LAOS, ARGUING THAT CHANGES
THAT OCCURRED EARLIER THIS YEAR IN KAMPUCHEA ARE &quot;IRREVERSIBLE.&quot; THE VIETNAMESE HAVE ALSO ACCUSED THE CHINESE
OF MASSING TROOPS ALONG THE BORDERS WITH VIETNAM AND
LAOS WHERE DAILY CHINESE &quot;INCURSIONS&quot; ARE SAID TO BE
CREATING AN &quot;INCREASINGLY TENSE&quot; SITUATION. NEITHER
SIDE HAS HINTED SO FAR THAT THE TALKS MAY BE CALLED OFF.
WE BELIEVE THAT ARMED PROVOCATIONS ARE OCCURRING ON
THE SINO-VIETNAMESE BORDER, PROBABLY FROM BOTH SIDES,
BUT CANNOT CONFIRM THE NUMBER AND SEVERITY AS ALLEGED
BY THE CHINESE AND VIETNAMESE MEDIA. FIVE PROTEST
NOTES BY THE CHINESE AND VIETNAMESE FOREIGN MINISTERIES
WERE EXCHANGED DURING JULY, BUT ONLY THE CHINESE LODGED
A PROTEST DURING AUGUST.
DESPITE THE WITHDRAWAL OF A LARGE NUMBER OF CHINESE
TROOPS AND AIRCRAFT FROM THE BORDER AREA, TENSION BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES CONTINUED TO BE IN EVIDENCE
THROUGHOUT THE SUMMER, AND THE CHINESE HAVE RECENTLY
STRENGTHENED THEIR DEFENSE UNITS ALONG THE BORDER.
ALTHOUGH NONE OF THESE RECENT DEVELOPMENTS INDICATE THAT

HOSTILITIES MAY SOON AGAIN ERUPT, VIETNAM IS CONCERNED
WITH ITS SECURITY ON THE CHINESE BORDER, AND HAS TAKEN
STEPS TO IMPROVE ITS MILITARY CAPABILITIES IN THE NORTHERN PART OF THE COUNTRY.
-- ROUGHLY 130,000-160,000 CHINESE TROOPS REMAIN POSITIONED ALONG THE SINO-VIETNAMESE BORDER. THUS FAR, WE
HAVE DETECTED NO MAJOR MOVEMENT OF CHINESE FORCES TOWARD
THE BORDER.
-- CHINESE AIR STRENGTH AT THE EIGHT BORDER AIRFIELDS
IS IN EXCESS OF 300 AIRCRAFT. THIS COMPARES WITH THE
NEARLY 900 FIGHTERS BASED AT THESE AIRFIELDS DURING THE
CONFLICT.
-- THERE HAS BEEN AN INCREASE IN CHINESE NAVAL SECURITY
ON HAINAN ISLAND AND IN THE PARACELS.
-- IN FEBRUARY VIETNAM HAD MORE THAN A DOZEN INFANTRY
AND ECONOMIC CONSTRUCTION DIVISIONS DEPLOYED IN THE RED
RIVER DELTA OF NORTHERN VIETNAM AND NEAR THE BORDER
WITH CHINA. FOLLOWING THE MARCH 1979 MOBILIZATION DE-

CREE, THREE NEW ARMY CORPS WERE FORMED IN THE NORTH AND
OTHER UNITS WERE DEPLOYED THERE. TODAY THERE ARE AT
LEAST 10 INFANTRY DIVISIONS IN NORTHERN VIETNAM AND MAYBE AS MANY AS 19, IN ADDITION TO FIVE ECONOMIC CONSTRUCTION DIVISIONS, AIR DEFENSE REGIMENTS, AND NUMEROUS
SUPPORT AND REGIONAL FORCES. OUR CURRENT ESTIMATE IS
THAT FROM THE HANOI AREA NORTH TO THE BORDER, TOTAL
VIETNAMESE GROUND FORCES RANGE FROM 225,000 TO 285,000
TROOPS. AT THE TIME OF THE CHINESE ATTACK, VIETNAMESE
GROUND STRENGTH WAS PROBABLY NO GREATER THAN 150,000.
-- VIETNAM HAS INCREASED ITS TACTICAL AIR STRENGTH IN
THE NORTH SINCE FEBRUARY. AT THE ONSET OF THE CHINESE
INVASION, THERE WERE SLIGHTLY MORE THAN 130 FIGHTERS AT
SECRET
SECRET
PAGE 08

STATE 263929

NORTHERN AIRFIELDS. CURRENTLY THERE ARE MORE THAN 150
COMBAT AIRCRAFT THERE.
-- VIETNAM HAS PLACED CONSIDERABLE EMPHASIS ON STRENGTHENING ITS DEFENSE IN THE NORTHEAST COASTAL REGION, ESPECIALLY QUANG NINH PROVINCE. LARGE NUMBERS OF MILITARY PERSONNEL, ARMORED VEHICLES AND ARTILLERY HAVE
BEEN DEPLOYED THERE. ACCORDING TO SOME UNCONFIRMED
REPORTS, THE VIETNAMESE HAD EMPLACED SOVIET-PROVIDED
SCUD SURFACE-TO-SURFACE MISSILES IN THE CAM PHA-HON
GAI AREA. THIS IS A LIQUID-PROPELLED AREA WEAPON
WITH A RANGE OF 300 KILOMETERS AND A CONVENTIONAL
PAYLOAD OF 1,000 KILOGRAMS. QUANG NINH PROVINCE,
THE ONLY NORTHERN PROVINCE TO ESCAPE CHINA'S FEBRUARY
ATTACKS, CONCERNS THE VIETNAMESE BECAUSE ITS RICH COAL
MINES WOULD MAKE A LUCRATIVE TARGET FOR A CHINESE SECOND
STRIKE.
THE SOVIETS HAVE SUPPLIED VIETNAM IN 1979 WITH SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNTS OF MILITARY HARDWARE, ALTHOUGH IT HAS BEEN
ESSENTIALLY MORE OF THE SAME WEAPONS ALREADY IN VIETNAMESE INVENTORIES. WEAPON DELIVERIES HAVE INCLUDED TR54/44 TANKS, MIG-21'S (SOME DESTINED FOR LAOS) FIELD
ARTILLERY PIECES, SA-2 SURFACE-TO-AIR MISSILES, AND
LARGE AMOUNTS OF FUEL, LUBRICANTS, AND AMMUNITION. VIETNAM'S NAVY HAS BEEN AUGMENTED BY A PAIR OF LIGHT FRIGATES
AND SOME PATROL BOATS. NUMEROUS MILITARY TRUCKS AND
TRAILERS HAVE BEEN PROVIDED AS WELL AS GENERAL PURPOSE
TRANSPORT HELICOPTERS.
SOVIET ACTIVITY IN VIETNAM DURING 1979 INCREASED AS WELL.
FOLLOWING THE CONFLICT WITH CHINA, THE VIETNAMESE PERMITSECRET

TED THE SOVIET NAVY TO USE ITS FACILITIES AT DA NANG AND
CAM RANH TO TEMPORARILY DEPLOY SOVIET COMBATANT VESSELS
AND LONG-RANGE RECONAISSANCE AIRCRAFT. SOVIET CREWS AND
AIRCRAFT ARE ALSO FLYING DAILY TRANSPORT MISSIONS FROM
VIETNAMESE AIR BASES TO LAOS AND KAMPUCHEA. NEVERTHELESS,
THE 3,000-5,000 MAN SOVIET ADVISORY PRESENCE IN VIETNAM
HAS NOT BEEN APPRECIABLY AUGMENTED AND THE SOVIETS DO NOT
APPEAR TO HAVE GAINED PERMANENT BASE RIGHTS.
DESPITE VIETNAMESE FEARS AND PROPAGANDA, THERE ARE NO INDICATIONS THAT A MAJOR CHINESE ATTACK IS IMMINENT. STATEMENTS ON THE SUBJECT, AS REPORTED IN THE MEDIA OR OBTAINED
THROUGH CLANDESTINE SOURCES, ARE AMBIGUOUS, ALTHOUGH THE
CHINESE CONTINUE TO WARN THAT THEY MAINTAIN THE RIGHT TO
TEACH VIETNAM A SECOND LESSON. MOST OF THE INDICATORS
WHICH APPEARED PRIOR TO CHINA'S FEBRUARY INVASION HAVE
YET TO BE REFLECTED. MAJOR AIR DEPLOYMENTS WHICH BEGAN
UP TO SIX WEEKS BEFORE THE INVASION HAVE NOT REOCCURRED.
CIVILIAN EVACUATIONS, TROOP RECALLS AND LEAVE CANCELLATIONS, ALERT POSTURES ALONG THE SINO-SOVIET BORDER, HAVE
ALL FAILED TO APPEAR THUS FAR. MOREOVER, IN THE BORDER
AREA VIETNAM IS DEFINITELY BETTER PREPARED FOR CONFLICT
WITH THE CHINESE THAN IT WAS EARLY LAST FEBRUARY, SO WE
ASSUME ANOTHER MAJOR ATTACK SIMILAR TO LAST FEBRUARY'S
WOULD REQUIRE A GREATER CHINESE BUILDUP THAN LAST FEBRUARY.
THE SITUATION IN KAMPUCHEA
THE MILITARY CONFRONTATION IN KAMPUCHEA HAS BEEN RELATIVELY SUBDUED DURING THE RAINY SEASON. HOWEVER, IN MIDSEPTEMBER, VIETNAMESE FORCES IN CENTRAL KAMPUCHEA LAUNCHED WHAT IS EXPECTED TO BECOME A NATIONWIDE MILITARY OFFENSIVE AIMED AT ELIMINATING POL POT FORCES AND OTHER KHMER
RESISTANCE ELEMENTS. THE VIETNAMESE ATTEMPT TO CONSOLIDATE CONTROL OF KAMPUCHEA HAS BEEN FRUSTRATED BY THE

APPROXIMATELY 30,000 ARMED POL POT TROOPS PLUS OTHER
RESISTANCE FORCES SUCH AS THE KHMER LIBERATION MOVEMENT
(KLM). THE VIETNAMESE OFFENSIVE IS EXPECTED TO GENERATE
GREAT REFUGEE PRESSURE ON THAILAND WITH AS MANY AS 200,000
KHMER CIVILIANS ULTIMATELY ATTEMPTING TO FLEE TO THAI
TERRITORY TO ESCAPE FAMINE AND RENEWED CONFLICT.

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014

THE RENEWED FIGHTING AGAIN RAISES THE PROSPECT OF A SPILLOVER OF THE FIGHTING INTO THAI TERRITORY EITHER INADVERTENTLY OR DELIBERATELY IN THE FORM OF &quot;HOT PURSUIT&quot;
RAIDS TARGETED ON RETREATING POL POT FORCES. THE NEW
OFFENSIVE IS LIKELY TO JEOPARDIZE INTERNATIONAL HUMANITARIAN RELIEF EFFORTS NOW GETTING UNDERWAY IN THE PRK
ZONE AS WELL AS DISRUPT BORDER FEEDING OPERATIONS AND
RELIEF OPERATIONS IN THE DK ZONE.
ICRC/UNICEF IS MOVING TOWARD FULL IMPLEMENTATION OF INTERNATIONAL RELIEF PROGRAM UNDER THEIR COORDINATION.
THE PROGRAM WILL RESPOND TO FAMINE-GENERATED NEEDS AMONG
THE KHMER THROUGH RELIEF OPERATIONS IN BOTH THE VIETNAMESE AND RESISTANCE CONTROLLED ZONES. IMPLEMENTATION
OF THE PROGRAMS FOLLOWS UPON PRK PERMISSION TO ICRC AND
UNICEF TO OPEN OFFICES IN PHNOM PENH AND DK WILLINGNESS
TO PERMIT INTERNATIONAL MONITORING OF RELIEF OPERATIONS
IN THE DK ZONE.
150,000-200,000 VIETNAMESE SOLDIERS ARE PRESENTLY
OCCUPYING KAMPUCHEA AND ATTEMPTING TO ERADICATE DEMOCRATIC KAMPUCHEA (DK) FORCES LOYAL TO POL POT. VIETNAMESE
CADRE SERVE AS ADMINISTRATORS AND ARE ATTEMPTING TO
RECRUIT AND TRAIN A CORPS OF ETHNIC KHMER CIVILIAN AND
MILITARY OFFICIALS. THE BULK OF THE POPULATION -- POSSIBLY AS MANY AS FOUR MILLION PEOPLE--IS UNDER THE CONTROL

OF THE VIETNAMESE-BACKED HENG SAMRIN REGIME (THE PEOPLE'S
REPUBLIC OF KAMPUCHEA - PRK).
DK FORCES PROBABLY NUMBER SOME 30,000, BUT WE ARE NOT CERTAIN HOW MANY CIVILIANS THEY CONTROL. ALTHOUGH DK UNITS
CONTINUE TO CONDUCT GUERRILLA OPERATIONS IN THE WESTERN,
CENTRAL, NORTHERN AND NORTHEASTERN REGIONS OF THE COUNTRY,
POL POT'S BASE IS IN THE CARDAMON MOUNTAINS, ABOUT 30 KILOMETERS SOUTHEAST OF PAILIN NEAR THE THAI BORDER.
ALONG WITH POLITICAL SUPPORT, BEIJING CONTINUES TO PROVIDE
MATERIAL SUPPORT TO THE POL POT FORCES TO THE LIMITED EXTENT POSSIBLE. ALTHOUGH THEY CAN APPLY PRESSURE ON THE
VIETNAMESE ELSEWHERE, KEEPING THEM OFF BALANCE AND RAISING THE MORALE OF KAMPUCHEA RESISTANCE FORCES, THE CHINESE
RECOGNIZE THAT AT THIS POINT THEY CAN EXERT ONLY LIMITED
DIRECT INFLUENCE ON THE OUTCOME IN KAMPUCHEA. HOWEVER,
THE CHINESE SEE SURVIVAL OF DK FORCES AS THE MOST IMPORTANT
ELEMENT IN THEIR STRATEGY TO DRAIN SRV RESOURCES AND FORCE
HANOI TO CHANGE ITS COURSE.
THE HENG SAMRIN REGIME (PRK) CONSISTS OF A SMALL GROUP

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
OF PRO-HANOI KHMERS PROVIDING THE FACADE OF AN INDEPENDENT
GOVERNMENT. VIETNAMESE EFFORTS TO RECRUIT AND TRAIN LARGE
NUMBERS OF QUALIFIED KHMER PERSONNEL HAVE PROVEN UNSUCCESSFUL THUS FAR. MOST ADMINISTRATIVE FUNCTIONS ARE PERFORMED
BY THE VIETNAMESE, AND RESENTMENT TO VIETNAMESE OCCUPATION
IS GROWING. HENG SAMRIN TROOPS ARE CONSIDERED SUSPECT BY
SRV AND SEVERAL UNITS HAVE REPORTEDLY DEFECTED TO KHMER
RESISTANCE. NONE OF THE COUNTRY'S MAJOR CITIES HAVE BEEN
REPOPULATED, THERE IS VERY LITTLE INDUSTRY, AND FEW
SCHOOLS, HOSPITALS AND OTHER FACILITIES ARE FUNCTIONING.
ALL TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS, AIRFIELDS, AND THE PORT OF
KOMPONG SOM ARE UNDER VIETNAMESE CONTROL. VERY LITTLE
LAND IS UNDER CULTIVATION, AND IT IS UNLIKELY THERE WILL

FOOD SHORTAGES AND FAMINE HAS BEGUN.
KHMER RESISTANCE FORCES, BOTH INSIDE THE COUNTRY AND
ABROAD, ARE ATTEMPTING TO FORM A UNITED FRONT TO DEFEAT
THE VIETNAMESE OCCUPYING FORCES. THE DK RECENTLY ORDERED
ITS FORCES TO UNITE WITH THE ANTI-COMMUNIST KHMER LIBERATION MOVEMENT (KLM) AND OTHER GROUPS TO FIGHT THE VIETNAMESE, DECLARING THAT DIFFERENCES ARE TO BE RESOLVED
THROUGH CONFERENCES, AND LATER THERE WILL BE &quot;UNIVERSAL,
FREE, AND SECRET ELECTIONS&quot; UNDER INTERNATIONAL SUPERVISION. ON SEPTEMBER 6, BOTH CHINESE AND POL POT-CONTROLLED RADIOS ANNOUNCED A DRAFT POLITICAL PROGRAM FOR
THE &quot;PATRIOTIC AND DEMOCRATIC FRONT OF THE GREAT NATIONAL
UNION OF KAMPUCHEA.&quot; THE DRAFT, WHICH MAKES NO MENTION
OF THE POL POT REGIME, IS CLEARLY INSPIRED BY THE CHINESE
AND IS INTENDED TO ATTRACT WIDER SUPPORT. SON SANN,
LEADER OF THE KLM, HAS SO FAR REFUSED TO SUPPORT THE
NEW FRONT. THE KLM, ALREADY COOPERATING IN AN UNEASY
MILITARY ALLIANCE WITH THE DK SINCE EARLY MAY, HAS
FIELDED SEVERAL BATTALIONS AND IS NOW TAKING AN ACTIVE
PART IN COMBAT OPERATIONS AGAINST THE VIETNAMESE.
PRINCE NORODOM SIHANOUK, CURRENTLY IN NORTH KOREA, HAS
REFUSED CHINESE REQUESTS TO COOPERATE WITH THE DK.
ALTHOUGH STILL A VERY POPULAR KHMER PATRIOT AND LEADER,
SIHANOUK RUNS THE RISK OF ISOLATING HIMSELF; THE CHINESE
BELIEVE THE REAL CONTEST IS BEING WAGED ON THE GROUND,
WHERE DK FORCES ARE PUTTING UP THE ONLY CREDIBLE RESISTANCE TO THE VIETNAMESE.

LIKELY. VIETNAMESE EFFORTS TO PACIFY THE COUNTRY AND
CREATE AN INDIGENOUS ADMINISTRATION OF PRO-HANOI KHMERS
ARE BOGGED DOWN. HOWEVER, THE SRV REMAINS FULLY DETERMINED TO RETAIN DOMINANCE OVER KAMPUCHEA AND DK AND KLM
FORCES ARE NOT ABLE TO EXPEL THE VIETNAMESE. VIETNAM IS
UNLIKELY TO PULL OUT ANY OF ITS FORCES OR AGREE TO NEGOTIATIONS ON THE NEUTRALIZATION OF KAMPUCHEA WHILE IT
BELIEVES IT HAS THE CAPABILITY TO DESTROY DK FORCES.
THE PRC IS ADAMANTLY OPPOSED TO ANY SOLUTION SHORT OF
COMPLETE SRV PULL OUT. MEANWHILE, THE KAMPUCHEAN PEOPLE
REMAIN THE VICTIM OF NEARLY A DECADE OF WAR AND SLAUGHTER.
THE SITUATION IN LAOS
AS A RESULT OF THE SINO-VIETNAMESE CONFLICT, IN EARLY
APRIL 1979 THE LAO GOVERNMENT PUBLICLY ACCUSED THE CHINESE OF BORDER PROVOCATIONS AND ORDERED A COUNTRYWIDE
MOBILIZATION OF MILITARY AND POLICE FORCES. IN ADDITION,
THE LAO HAVE TAKEN MEASURES TO INCREASE THEIR READINESS
POSTURE AND REINFORCE THEIR FORCES ALONG THE BORDER.
TROOPS HAVE BEEN AIRLIFTED TO THE BORDER AND ADDITIONAL
ARMOR AND ARTILLERY ARE BEING DEPLOYED THERE. MORE SOVIET-MADE MIG AIRCRAFT HAVE BEEN TRANSFERRED FROM VIETNAM
TO LAOS. A NEW COMBAT ZONE ENCOMPASSING THREE PROVINCES
-- LUANG NAMTHA, OUDOMSAI, AND PHONG SALY -- ALL OF WHICH
BORDER ON CHINA'S YUNNAN PROVINCE, HAS BEEN CREATED IN AN
ATTEMPT TO IMPROVE COMMAND AND CONTROL OF LAO FORCES IN
THAT REGION.
NEARLY 40,000 VIETNAMESE TROOPS IN LAOS ARE INVOLVED
IN CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITIES AND SUPPRESSION OF ANTICOMMUNIST RESISTANCE ELEMENTS. THERE ARE SOME INDICANORTHERN LAOS. SINCE SPRING OF THIS YEAR, VIETNAMESE
AND SOVIET AIRCRAFT HAVE CONDUCTED NUMEROUS RESUPPLY
FLIGHTS THROUGHOUT LAOS.

ROAD BUILDING AND CIVIC ACTION PROGRAMS. ALTHOUGH THESE

HAVE ALREADY OCCURRED THIS YEAR. ALTHOUGH CHINA MAINTAINS NO REGULAR FORCES ALONG THE SINO-LAO BORDER, IT
HAS RECENTLY AUGMENTED ITS BORDER DEFENSE REGIMENTS, AND
MAINTAINS A REGULAR FORCE DIVISION SOME 80 KILOMETERS
NORTH OF THE BORDER. CHINA HAS MADE CONTACT WITH LAO
EXILE LEADERS IN PARIS AND IS REPORTEDLY SEEKING TO RECRUIT LAO TRIBAL REFUGEES FROM REFUGEE CAMPS IN THAILAND
FOR MILITARY TRAINING IN CHINA.
CHINESE PRESSURE ON LAOS IS DESIGNED TO STRETCH VIETNAMESE FORCES EVEN THINNER OVER A PROLONGED PERIOD AND
TO KEEP THE SRV OFF BALANCE. AS LONG AS VIETNAM REMAINS
DETERMINED TO ACHIEVE ITS LONG CHERISHED DREAM OF HEGEMONY IN INDOCHINA, THE CHINESE CAN BE EXPECTED OVER THE
NEXT FEW YEARS TO MAKE THE VIETNAMESE PAY A HIGH PRICE.
THE CHINESE, HOWEVER, ARE MORE APT TO FOSTER ANTI-LAO
ACTIVITIES BY TRIBAL GROUPS THAN TO UNDERTAKE LARGE-SCALE
MILITARY OPERATIONS INSIDE LAOS. SHOULD THE CHINESE
ATTACK VIETNAM AGAIN, HOWEVER, THEY MAY CONCURRENTLY
ESTABLISH A SECOND FRONT IN LAOS, USING SOME OF THEIR
OWN MILITARY FORCES, BUT PRINCIPALLY RELYING ON INSURGENTS TO PIN DOWN VIETNAMESE FORCES.

TING A CRISIS OF CONFIDENCE SINCE JANUARY GENERATED BY
THE POTENTIAL THREAT TO THAILAND POSED BY LARGE NUMBERS
OF VIETNAMESE TROOPS IN KAMPUCHEA AND THE MASSIVE UPSURGE
IN REFUGEES FROM INDOCHINA. TACTICAL POLICY DIFFERENCES
REMAIN, BUT ASEAN UNITY HAS BEEN EVIDENT: A) IN ITS
SERIES OF PUBLIC STATEMENTS CONDEMMING VIETNAMESE AND
CHINESE TERRITORIAL AGGRESSION IN INDOCHINA AND VIETNAMESE POLICIES THAT LED TO THE MASSIVE OUTFLOW OF REFUGEES FROM INDOCHINA; B) IN ITS CALL FOR A POLITICAL
SOLUTION IN KAMPUCHEA; C) IN THE APPARENTLY COORDINATED DECISION TO DENY SOVIET FLEET CALLS AT ASEAN
PORTS; AND D) IN CURRENT ACTIVITIES AT
THE UN. EVENTS IN INDOCHINA HAVE ALSO LED TO INCREASED
BILATERAL AND TRILATERAL SECURITY AND MILITARY CONSULTATIONS AND COOPERATION AMONG INDIVIDUAL ASEAN STATES.
THESE LATTER ARRANGEMENTS ARE DELIBERATELY KEPT SEPARATE
AND DISTINCT FROM COLLECTIVE ASEAN ARRANGEMENTS.
THE ASEAN STATES ARE APPREHENSIVE ABOUT LONG-TERM
CHINESE, VIETNAMESE AND SOVIET INTENTIONS IN SOUTHEAST
ASIA, AS WELL AS THE U.S. SECURITY ROLE IN THE REGION.

AT THE SAME TIME, THEY WANT TO BE REASSURED OF U.S.

EACH ASEAN STATE HAS A SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT VIEW OF CHINESE

CHINA IN THE HOPE OF FRUSTRATING TOTAL VIETNAMESE CONTROL OF KAMPUCHEA AND BALANCING THE INCREASED VIETNAMESE THREAT. MALAYSIA IS MORE CONCERNED OVER CHINA'S
LONG-TERM INTENTIONS IN THE REGION THAN THOSE OF THE
USSR. SINGAPORE BELIEVES THAT THE EXPANDING SOVIET
NAVAL PRESENCE IN THE REGION IS THE GREATEST IMMEDIATE
THREAT, WHILE RECOGNIZING THAT A MODERNIZED CHINA IS A
LONG-TERM PROBLEM. INSULATED BY GEOGRAPHY, THE PHILIPPINES FEELS THE LEAST THREATENED BY VIETNAM'S INVASION
OF KAMPUCHEA AND BY SINO-SOVIET RIVALRY IN SOUTHEAST
ASIA; THE FILIPINOS BELIEVE THEY CAN DEAL WITH THE PRC
AND ARE MOST WORRIED BY SOVIET INTENTIONS IN THE LONG
RUN.
WHATEVER THEIR GREATEST INDIVIDUAL FEARS, ALL THE ASEAN
STATES SHARE A COMMON AWARENESS OF THEIR MILITARY WEAKNESS. WHILE THEY ESCHEW A COLLECTIVE MILITARY ROLE
FOR ASEAN AND CONTINUE TO CONCENTRATE ON ECONOMIC AND
SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT AS THE BEST LONG RUN APPROACH TO
MAINTAINING STABILITY AND INDEPENDENCE -- AND ATTACH
GREAT IMPORTANCE TO CONTINUING TRADE AND AID FROM THE
WEST -- THE ASEAN MEMBERS HAVE COOPERATED AMONG THEMSELVES ON SECURITY MATTERS AND SEEK WESTERN SECURITY AS
WELL AS ECONOMIC SUPPORT.
MOST IMMEDIATELY VULNERABLE TO THE POSSIBILITY OF A SPILL

PSYCHOLOGICAL SUPPORT FROM THE PRESENCE OF US FORCES
IN THE AREA.
WHILE THE THAI DO NOT RECEIVE MILITARY ASSISTANCE FROM
OTHER COUNTRIES, THE RTG HAS RECENTLY BEGUN TO PURCHASE
FROM THIRD COUNTRIES DEFENSE ITEMS WHICH ARE UNAVAILABLE

RECONNAISSANCE VEHICLES, ISRAELI ARTILLERY, AND ITALIAN

WITHIN THE REGION, THAILAND HAS A BORDER COOPERATION
AGREEMENT WITH MALAYSIA WHICH PROVIDES FOR COMBINED
MILITARY OPERATIONS AND TRAINING, AND A SMALL JOINT
PROGRAM WITH SINGAPORE TO PRODUCE GRENADE LAUNCHERS.
THE OTHER ASEAN NATIONS DO NOT ENVISION THE POSSIBILITY
OF A DIRECT THREAT FROM VIETNAM IN THE SAME WAY THAILAND
CAN. HOWEVER, MALAYSIA AND SINGAPORE AND INDONESIA TO
A LESSER DEGREE SHARE CONCERNS ABOUT GRADUAL ENCROACHMENT BY THE COMMUNIST POWERS AND DO NOT EXCLUDE THE
POSSIBILITY THAT COLLAPSE IN THAILAND WOULD LEAD TO
INCREASED REGIONAL AND INTERNAL TENSIONS AND INSTABILITY FOR THEMSELVES. ACCORDINGLY, THEY HAVE INITIATED
MODEST PROGRAMS TO MODERNIZE AND IN SOME CASES EXPAND

TRADITIONAL EXPORTS REMAIN DEPRESSED ON WORLD MARKETS.

CRISES OF ALMOST EQUAL SEVERITY IN THE PAST.
THERE HAVE BEEN FEW DRAMATIC DEVELOPMENTS IN FOREIGN
POLICY. MARCOS MAINTAINS GOOD RELATIONS WITH THE IMPORTANT OIL SUPPLYING ARAB NATIONS WHILE THE MUSLIM INSURGENCY IN THE SOUTHERN PHILIPPINES REMAINS UNRESOLVED.
CORDIAL RELATIONS WITH CHINA WERE STRENGTHENED BY THE
OPENING OF AIR SERVICE BETWEEN MANILA AND BEIJING AND BY
AN ARRANGEMENT UNDER WHICH THE PHILIPPINES WILL PROVIDE
CAPITAL, CONSTRUCTION SERVICES AND INITIAL MANAGEMENT FOR
TOURIST HOTELS TO BE BUILT IN CHINA. IN SUPPORT OF ITS
ASEAN FRIENDS, THE PHILIPPINES AGREED TO PROVIDE THE

ECONOMIC PROBLEMS, PARTICULARLY ENERGY AND INFLATION.
THE MOST DRAMATIC CHALLENGES, OF COURSE, ARE REFUGEES
AND THE VIETNAMESE ON THE BORDER.
THE KRIANGSAK GOVERNMENT PLACED AN INITIAL HIGH PRIORITY
ON IMPROVING RELATIONS WITH INDOCHINA. THE VIETNAMESE
INVASION OF KAMPUCHEA IN JANUARY 1979, MILITARY INCIDENTS
ON THE BORDER AND THE MASSIVE INFLOWS OF REFUGEES INTO
THAILAND FROM LAOS, KAMPUCHEA AND VIETNAM HAVE NOW CREATED A PERIOD OF ASCERBIC TENSION AND MILITARY UNCERTAINTY. IN KAMPUCHEA, THE THAI HAVE PROCLAIMED A NEUTRAL
POLICY, BUT TEND TO BE SYMPATHETIC TOWARD THE EFFORTS
OF THE POL POT AND OTHER FORCES TO RESIST VIETNAM'S
ATTEMPTED ABSORPTION. THAI-LAO RELATIONS HAVE BEEN SOMEWHAT INSULATED FROM THAI-VIETNAMESE PROBLEMS. THAICHINESE RELATIONS, PARTICULARLY IN THE WAKE OF THE INDOCHINESE EVENTS, ARE BETTER THAN AT ANY TIME IN RECENT
MEMORY.

IN ASIA. MAJOR EFFORTS WILL BE NEEDED TO UPHOLD
THE PRINCIPLE OF FIRST ASYLUM AND AVOID EVEN GREATER
TRAGEDY THAN HAS ALREADY OCCURRED.
THE EXODUS OF INDOCHINESE REFUGEES PEAKED IN MAY AND
JUNE WITH AN ESTIMATED 60,000 ARRIVALS IN FIRST ASYLUM
COUNTRIES IN THE LATTER MONTH. IT DIMINISHED MARKEDLY
IN JULY TO ABOUT 34,000 AND MUCH FURTHER IN AUGUST IN
THE WAKE OF THE GENEVA CONFERENCE TO APPROXIMATELY
12,000. AUGUST WAS THE FIRST TIME IN MANY MONTHS THAT
THE NUMBER OF REFUGEES DEPARTING FOR RESETTLEMENT, 19,466,
SUBSTANTIALLY EXCEEDED ARRIVALS. HOWEVER, OVER 350,000
REFUGEES REMAINED IN UNHCR CAMPS IN SOUTHEAST ASIA AS OF
MID-SEPTEMBER.
TESTIMONY OF REFUGEES AND OTHER EVIDENCE INDICATES THAT
THE DOWNTURN IN BOAT REFUGEES IS DUE DIRECTLY TO THE SRV'S
MORATORIUM ON &quot;ILLEGALS&quot; DEPARTING,WHICH WAS ANNOUNCED AT
GENEVA AND IS BEING ENFORCED BY THE VIETNAMESE GOVERNMENT. THE DECLINE IN LAO REFUGEES FROM AN AVERAGE OF
6,000 PER MONTH TO 3,000 IN AUGUST REFLECTS TOUGHER MEASURES BY BOTH THAI AND LAO AUTHORITIES. THE OUTLOOK IS
NOT ENCOURAGING, HOWEVER. THE NEW SRV OFFENSIVE INAUGURATED IN KAMPUCHEA WITH THE EARLY END OF THE RAINY SEASON WILL INTENSIFY FAMINE, DISEASE, AND SECURITY PROBLEMS AMONG THE KAMPUCHEAN PEOPLE AND AN OMINOUS AND
MASSIVE NEW EXODUS OF PERHAPS 200,000 REFUGEES INTO THAILAND IS PREDICTABLE. ARRANGEMENTS HAVE BEEN INITIATED
ON AN URGENT BASIS TO BRING FOOD AND MEDICINE TO KHMER
REFUGEES SITUATED ALONG THE BORDER AND INTO PHNOM PENH.

ICRC, THE WORLD FOOD PROGRAM, FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS AND
VOLUNTARY AGENCIES ON THE VARIOUS ASPECTS OF THIS PROBLEM,

INCLUDING WAYS OF PROVIDING FOOD TO KHMER WHO MAY SOON

IN PHNOM PENH TO NEGOTIATE FOOD AND MEDICINE DELIVERIES
TO KHMER UNDER HENG SAMRIN CONTROL HAVE BEEN MARKED BY
PRK AND VIETNAMESE STALLING, HOWEVER, AND NOW THAT THE OFFENSIVE IS UNDERWAY CHANCES OF GETTING SHIPMENTS DISTRIBUTED TO STAVE OFF MASSIVE DEATHS ARE DIMMING.
IN ADDITION TO THE PENDING LAND REFUGEE CRISIS THERE IS A
WIDESPREAD EXPECTATION THROUGHOUT ASIA, BACKED BY A NUMBER
OF POSITIVE INDICATIONS, THAT VIETNAM HAS NOT ALTERED ITS
BASIC GOAL OF RIDDING ITSELF OF &quot;UNDESIRABLE&quot; SINO-VIETNAMESE AND SOME ETHNIC VIETNAMESE. A RENEWAL OF HIGH LEVELS
OF BOAT REFUGEES BEFORE THE END FO THE YEAR IS ALSO WIDELY
ANTICIPATED.
IN LIGHT OF THESE EXPECTATIONS, APART FROM THE KAMPUCHEAN
RELIEF EFFORT, CONTINUING MAJOR RESETTLEMENT AND FINANCIAL
ASSISTANCE FROM THE WEALTHY NATIONS ARE REQUIRED. (RESETTLEMENT OFFERS AT THE TIME OF GENEVA FOR THE ENSURING
YEAR WERE 270,000 INCLUDING 168,000 FROM THE U.S.) THE
REFUGEE PROCESSING CENTERS NOW AGREED FOR CONSTRUCTION
ON BATAAN AND UNDERWAY ON GALANG ISLAND IN INDONESIA ARE
NEEDED URGENTLY TO HELP REDUCE REFUGEE POPULATIONS IN FIRST ASYLUM COUNTRIES AND ENCOURAGE HUMANE FIRST ASYLUM POLICIES. CONTINUING CONSCIENTIOUS EFFORT MUST BE MADE TO
WIDEN THE WORLD'S MERCHANT FLEET PARTICIPATION IN THE SEARCH AND RESCUE AT SEA EFFORTS -- OVER 600 BOAT REFUGEES
HAD BEEN RESCUED BY SEVENTH FLEET VESSELS AS OF MID-SEPTEMBER. LARGE NUMBERS OF EUROPEAN MERCHANT SHIPS -- AS
WELL AS REMARKABLE ITALIAN NAVAL TASK FORCE EFFORT -- HAVE
CHANGED COURSE AND RESCUED BOAT REFUGEES IN THE WEEKS
SINCE GENEVA. THERE IS NEED FOR A POOL OF RESETTLEMENT

LAUNCHED.

AS A MEANS OF EMBARRASSING HANOI. CHINA HAS ACKNOWLEDGED
THAT IT IS RESETTLING OVER 200,000 REFUGEES AND HAS OFFERED TO TAKE 10,000 MORE FOR RESETTLEMENT FROM SOUTHEAST
ASIAN CAMPS. IT ALSO RECENTLY REQUESTED UNHCR ASSISTANCE

IN MARCH AND APRIL, DENG APPEARED TO BE IN TROUBLE. A
COMBINATION OF POLICY PROBLEMS, NEGATIVE REACTIONS TO
THE IDEOLOGICAL LINE OF THE DENG-DOMINATED PARTY PLENUM
OF DECEMBER 1978, AND OPPOSITION TO HIS ABRASIVE PERSONAL STYLE HAD LED TO CRITICISM FROM A NUMBER OF QUARTERS.
THIS RESULTED IN A DIMUNITION OF DENG'S POLITICAL STANDING AND A WATERING DOWN OF HIS IDEOLOGICAL LINE. HE WAS
CRITICIZED FOR EXCESSES IN THE PRC'S AMBITIOUS ECONOMIC
MODERNIZATION PROGRAM, FOR PROMOTING DE-MAOIZATION AND
UNDERMINING THE SANCTITY OF MAO'S THOUGHT, AND FOR THE
SOCIAL DISORDER GROWING OUT OF THE &quot;DEMOCRACY&quot; MOVEMENT.
SENIOR ECONOMIC SPECIALISTS TOOK A HARD LOOK AT THE SPECIFICS OF THE ECONOMIC MODERNIZATION PROGRAM, SCALED IT
DOWN TO MORE REALISTIC LEVELS AND REDIRECTED PRIORITIES
AWAY FROM HEAVY INDUSTRY AND TOWARD AGRICULTURE. IDEOLOGICALLY, THE MEDIA PROMOTED THE &quot;FOUR UPHOLDS:&quot; 1) KEEP-

PROLETARIAT; 3) THE LEADERSHIP OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY; 4)
MARXISM-LENINISM-MAO ZEDONG THOUGHT. FINALLY, NATIONWIDE, THERE WAS A CRACKDOWN ON THE &quot;DEMOCRACY&quot; MOVEMENT.

MEDIA TO REASSERT HIS FAVORITE THEMES -- THE FALLIBILITY
OF MAO, THE NEED FOR &quot;DEMOCRACY&quot; AS A PREREQUISITE FOR
ECONOMIC MODERNIZATION, AND &quot;SEEKING TRUTH FROM FACTS,&quot;

ABANDONMENT OF OBSOLETE DOGMA AND ADOPTION OF A PRAGMATIC,
GOAL-ORIENTED IDEOLOGY -- WON WIDESPREAD APPROVAL FROM THE
DELEGATES. PARTY CHAIRMAN HUA GUOFENG MOVED A LONG-WAY
TOWARD IDENTIFYING HIMSELF WITH THESE DENGIST POSITIONS.
DENG LEFT BEIJING SHORTLY AFTER THE CONGRESS AND DID NOT
REAPPEAR PUBLICLY IN THE CAPITAL FOR MORE THAN SIX WEEKS.
PART OF THIS TIME WAS APPARENTLY SPENT ON VACATION, BUT
DENG ALSO TRAVELED TO VARIOUS PROVINCES AND CITIES MAKING
INSPECTIONS, HEARING OPINIONS, EXPOUNDING HIS IDEAS, AND
APPARENTLY LINING UP POLITICAL SUPPORT. HAVING MENDED HIS
POLITICAL FENCES, DENG IS ONCE AGAIN PUSHING FOR A JUDGMENT AGAINST HIS POLITBURO ADVERSARIES.
DENG AND HIS SUPPORTERS BELIEVE IDEOLOGY AND THE PARTY
ORGANIZATION MUST BE REFORMED BEFORE CHINA CAN MAKE PROGRESS TOWARD ITS GOAL OF &quot;SOCIALIST MODERNIZATION.&quot; FOR
MORE THAN A YEAR THEY HAVE PUSHED THE CAMPAIGN TO FREE
CHINESE IDEOLOGY FROM THE RIGID DOGMATISM THAT LED TO SUCH
DISRUPTIVE AND DESTRUCTIVE PROGRAMS AS THE GREAT LEAP FORWARD AND THE CULTURAL REVOLUTION. THEY BELIEVE THAT MANY
PARTY OFFICIALS PROMOTED DURING THE CULTURAL REVOLUTION
ARE ILL-SUITED TO LEAD CHINA TOWARD ITS GOAL OF SOLID
ECONOMIC PROGRESS IN THE 1980S, AS THEY ARE INCOMPETENT,
NOT IDEOLOGICALLY WELL-DISPOSED TOWARD THE NEW POLICIES,

AND CRITICISM OF THE &quot;WHATEVER FACTION&quot; HAS BECOME A MAJOR
THEME IN THE MEDIA. BOTH OF THESE ARE THINLY VEILED ATTACKS AGAINST POLITBURO MEMBER WANG DONGXING AND SOURCES
OF OTHER ERRANT OFFICIALS THROUGHOUT THE PRC BUREAUCRACY;
-- AUTHORITATIVE MEDIA COMMENTARIES HAVE CONDEMNED THE
CORRUPTION AND MISUSE OF AUTHORITY OF UNNAMED OFFICIALS;
-- THE PARTY'S THEORETICAL JOURNAL, &quot;RED FLAG,&quot; HAS ADMITTED THAT IT ERRED IN NOT FULLY SUPPORTING THE NEW
IDEOLOGICAL LINE. THE JOURNAL WAS FORMERLY UNDER THE
DIRECTION OF WANG;
-- NON-DENGINST PROVINCIAL LEADERS CONTINUE TO BE EASED
OUT.
THE PROVINCES HAVE PROVIDED DENG WITH STRONG BACKING. PROVINCIAL MEDIA HAVE BEEN ACTIVE IN LINKING ORGANIZATIONAL
AND PERSONNEL PROBLEMS TO THE IDEOLOGICAL ISSUE. CITING
INCORRECT IDEOLOGY AS THE ROOT CAUSE OF PROBLEMS, SEVERAL
PROVINCIAL LEADERS HAVE MOUNTED A RENEWED AND STRENGTHENED
ATTACK AGAINST FACTIONALISM. IDEOLOGICAL CONFUSION IS
BLAMED FOR THE FAILURE TO ERADICATE THESE PROBLEMS NEARLY
THREE YEARS AFTER THE PURGE OF THE GANG OF FOUR. MOST
COMMENTATORS HAVE STRESSED THE NEED FOR LENIENCY AND RESTRAINT, BUT THERE ARE INCREASING CALLS FOR TOUGHER MEASURES, INCLUDING A PURGE OF RECALCITRANTS AND FOOT DRAGGERS.
WHILE OPPOSITION TO DENG AND HIS IDEOLOGY STILL EXISTS,
IT APPEARS TO BE GROWING PROGRESSIVELY WEAKER. MANY CADRES AT VARIOUS LEVELS STILL FEEL THREATHENED BY THE IDEOLOGICAL AND POLICY REVERSALS BROUGHT ABOUT BY HIS LEADERSHIP. THEY FEAR THEY WILL NOW BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR

IN DECEMBER 1978, CHINA REACHED A CROSSROADS ON ITS PATH
TO ECONOMIC MODERNIZATION. ITS HEADLONG RUSH INTO A PROGRAM TO DEVELOP THE ECONOMY THROUGH MASSIVE INFUSIONS OF
ADVANCED WESTERN TECHNOLOGY AND EQUIPMENT INVOLVED STAGGERING SUMS. CHINESE COMMERCIAL DELEGATIONS ABROAD HAD
INQUIRED INTO OR NEGOTIATED FOR AT LEAST $80 BILLION
WORTH OF FOREIGN CAPITAL EQUIPMENT. THE CHINESE HAD SIGNED CONTRACTS AMOUNTING TO $7 BILLION, INCLUDING $5 BILLION
IN ONE 10-DAY STRETCH IN DECEMBER. SUCH A HECTIC PACE
COULD NOT CONTINUE BECAUSE CHINA WAS RAPIDLY EXHAUSTING
ITS FOREIGN EXCHANGE RESERVES.
FOLLOWING THE DECEMBER PLENUM OF THE CHINESE COMMUNIST
PARTY, BEIJING CALLED A HALT TO THE BUYING SPREE WHILE
CHINA'S LEADERS REASSESSED THE ENTIRE DIRECTION AND SCOPE
OF THE MODERNIZATION PROGRAM. IN FEBRUARY, BEIJING NOT
ONLY HALTED ONGOING NEGOTIATIONS FOR NEW PLANTS BUT ALSO
SUSPENDED SOME $2.6 BILLION WORTH OF PLANT CONTRACTS SIGNED WITH JAPANESE FIRMS AFTER 16 DECEMBER. FOREIGN BUSINESSMEN WERE TOLD NOT TO EXPECT A RESUMPTION OF CONTRACT
TALKS UNTIL THE SECOND HALF OF 1979.

THE REASSESSMENT WAS APPARENTLY COMPLETED BY JUNE. LATE
THAT MONTH THE NATIONAL PEOPLE'S CONGRESS (NPC) MET TO
RATIFY THE DECISIONS MADE BY BEIJING'S LEADERS DURING THE
INTERLUDE. THE CHOICES MADE WILL HAVE MAJOR IMPLICATIONS
FOR CHINA'S FOREIGN ECONOMIC RELATIONS FOR YEARS TO COME.
FIRST, BEIJING DECIDED THAT GREATER &quot;BALANCE&quot; WAS NEEDED
BETWEEN THE VARIOUS SECTORS OF THE ECONOMY. BEIJING
WOULD SCALE BACK INVESTMENT IN HEAVY INDUSTRY IN ORDER TO
PROVIDE MORE FUNDS TO AGRICULTURE AND LIGHT INDUSTRY.
WHILE THIS UNDOUBTEDLY MEANS THAT BEIJING WILL POSTPONE
ITS PLANS TO PURCHASE SEVERAL STEEL MILLS FROM ABROAD -AND PROBABLY OTHER MAJOR DEVELOPMENTS PROJECTS AS WELL -SECRET
SECRET
PAGE 32

STATE 263929

IT DOES NOT MEAN THAT CHINA IS SHELVING ITS MODERNIZATION
PLANS AND RETURNING TO THE INWARD-LOOKING POLICIES OF THE
PAST. INDEED, BEIJING HAS -OMMITTED ITSELF TO EXPANDI;G
TRADE BY DEVELOPING NEW EXPORT INDUSTRIES. THE CHINESE
LEADERSHIP BELIEVES THAT CHANNELING MORE FUNDS INTO LIGHT
INDUSTRY WILL PRODUCE A GREATER AND MORE IMMEDIATE RETURN
ON THE INVESTMENT, AND SUBSTANTIALLY BOOST FOREIGN EXCHANGE EARNINGS. MOREOVER, BEIJING HAS ADVANCED ITS PLANS
TO PURCHASE ELECTRIC POWER PLANTS, TRANSPORTATION AND COMMUNICATIONS FACILITIES, AND OTHER EQUIPMENT TO DEVELOP
CHINA'S ECONOMIC INFRASTRUCTURE.
SECOND, IN ANNOUNCING TO THE NPC THAT CHINA PLANNED TO
BORROW FOREIGN FUNDS TO FINANCE A LARGE PORTION OF ITS
CAPITAL IMPORTS, BEIJING FORMALLY BROKE WITH THE MAOIST
DICTUM WHICH HELD THAT FOREIGN INDEBTEDNESS COULD NOT BE
CONDONED. (VICE PREMIER YU QIULI TOLD THE NPC THAT CHINA
PLANNED TO RUN A RECORD $3.5 BILLION TRADE DEFICIT THIS
YEAR.) LONG BEFORE THE NPC MET, CHINA'S INTENTION TO
ENGAGE IN DEBT FINANCING HAD BECOME APPARENT. FROM
DECEMBER 1978 THROUGH MAY OF THIS YEAR, CHINA ARRANGED
CREDIT LINES TOTALING MORE THAN $25 BILLION. THE NPC
MERELY GAVE ITS SANCTION TO THIS POLICY.
FINALLY, THE NPC APPROVED A LAW WHICH WOULD PERMIT, FOR
THE FIRST TIME, DIRECT FOREIGN INVESTMENT IN THE FORM
OF JOINT VENTURES BETWEEN CHINESE CORPORATIONS AND PRIVATE
FOREIGN FIRMS. UNDER SOME CIRCUMSTANCES, FOREIGNERS MAY
EVEN BE ALLOWED TO HOLD 100-PERCENT EQUITY IN PLANTS LOCATED IN CHINA. THIS POLICY ABSOLUTELY REVERSES THE MAOIST STANCE ON THE QUESTION OF FOREIGN OWNERSHIP OF THE
&quot;MEANS OF PRODUCTION&quot; IN THE CHINESE ECONOMY. LACKING ANY

TRACK RECORD, IT IS DIFFICULT TO FORECAST HOW MUCH FOREIGN
CAPITAL CHINA WILL BE ABLE TO ATTRACT BY THIS MEANS. ONLY
FOUR OTHER COMMUNIST COUNTRIES (POLAND, HUNGARY, ROMANIA,
AND YUGOSLAVIA) HAVE PERMITTED JOINT VENTURES, BUT NONE
ALLOW 100-PERCENT FOREIGN EQUITY; AND THERE THE RESULTS
HAVE BEEN MIXED. IN CHINA'S CASE, HOWEVER, AN ABUNDANT
LABOR SUPPLY -- AND LOW WAGES -- COULD PROVE TO BE A MAJOR
ATTRACTION TO WESTERN INVESTORS. IN THE LONG RUN, THIS
STEP COULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT.
THE NEW CHINESE ADMINISTRATION HAS CLEARLY STAKED ITS
POLITICAL FUTURE ON ECONOMIC MODERNIZATION. THE VIABILITY OF THE PROGRAM WILL DEPEND LARGELY ON THE SKILL OF
CHINA'S PLANNERS IN ARRANGING FOR THE SYSTEMATIC ABSORPTION OF FOREIGN TECHNOLOGY AND RAISING THE FOREIGN EXCHANGE NEEDED TO HELP MEET THE BILLS.
THERE ARE GROUNDS FOR OPTIMISM, AS THE NEW POLICIES EMBODY AN UNPRECENDENTLY RATIONAL APPROACH TO CHINA'S ECONOMIC PROBLEMS. COMPARED TO THE MAOIST ERA, THE LEADERSHIP
IS MUCH LESS BOUND BY IDEOLOGICAL CONSTRAINTS IN ITS POLICY CHOICES. IN THEIR REASSESSMENT AND REDRAFTING OF
POLICIES DURING THE FIRST HALF OF 1979, THE CHINESE HAVE
DEMONSTRATED AN ABILITY TO REACT QUICKLY AND RATIONALLY
TO NEW PROBLEMS CREATED BY THE NEW POLICIES.
IN THE SHORT TERM, PERHAPS THE MOST DIFFICULT PROBLEMS
THEY WILL FACE WILL BE THOSE OF HANDLING RISING CONSUMER
EXPECTATIONS, AND PROVIDING EMPLOYMENT FOR THE MILLIONS
OF JUNIOR AND MIDDLE SCHOLL GRADUATES. THESE, PLUS THE
LONG LEAD TIMES REQUIRED TO BRING NEW PROJECTS INTO PRODUCTION IN BOTTLENECK SECTORS, MAKE IT LIKELY THAT THE
CURRENT PERIOD OF &quot;READJUSTING, RESTRUCTURING, CONSOLIDATING AND IMPROVING THE ECONOMY&quot; WILL LAST LONGER THAN
THAN THE PLANNED THREE YEARS. THE CHINESE SIXTH FIVESECRET

PRIME MINISTER OHIRA, WHO SCORED AN UPSET VICTORY OVER
FORMER PRIME MINISTER FUKUDA IN LAST NOVEMBER'S LDP PRESIDENTIAL PRIMARY, HAS EFFECTIVELY USED HIS TIME IN OFFICE

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
TO DEVELOP HIS STANDING AMONG THE JAPANESE ELECTORATES AND
WITHIN HIS OWN PARTY HIERARCHY. OHIRA IS A RELATIVELY
POPULAR PARTY LEADER AND FREE OF ASSOCIATION WITH EARLIER
SCANDALS WHICH HAVE PLAGUED THE LDP. HIS CONFIDENCE WAS
REFLECTED IN HIS DECISION TO CALL FOR ELECTIONS ON OCTOBER 7, IN WHICH HE HOPED TO REVERSE THE PATTERN OF THE
PAST AND PICK UP SEATS IN THE LOWER HOUSE. (OHIRA'S
GOAL HAD BEEN 271 -- OF 511 -- LOWER HOUSE SEATS, AN INCREASE OF 22 OVER ITS PRESENT 249 SEATS, AND A LARGE ENOUGH MAJORITY TO REGAIN CONTROL OF THE CRITICAL LEGISLATIVE
BUDGET COMMITTEE.) OHIRA WAS EXPECTED TO BE IN A STRONGER
POSITION AFTER THE ELECTION.
A MAJOR CABINET RESHUFFLE IS EXPECTED IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING THE ELECTION AND CHANGES ARE LIKELY IN VIRTUALLY ALL
OF THE CABINET POSITIONS. ACTIVISTS FOREIGN MINISTER
SUNAO SONODA, THE ONLY HOLDOVER FROM THE PREVIOUS FUKUDA
CABINET, IS EXPECTED TO SHIFT TO A PARTY POSITION, A LOGICAL MOVE IN TERMS OF HIS OWN FUTURE ASPIRATIONS. THE NEW
CABINET IS NOT EXPECTED TO AUGUR ANY SUBSTANTIAL CHANGES
IN FOREIGN OR DOMESTIC POLICY.
THE MAJOR DIPLOMATIC GOAL OF THE OHIRA GOVERNMENT HAS
BEEN THE RESOLUTION OF ECONOMIC DIFFERENCES WITH THE U.S.

AND PERSONAL DISCUSSIONS BETWEEN THE PRESIDENT AND PRIME

MINISTER IN WASHINGTON IN MAY AND IN TOKYO IN JUNE, MUCH
PROGRESS HAS BEEN MADE IN RESOLVING THESE DIFFERENCES.
THE SUCCESSFUL CONCLUSION OF MTN NEGOTIATIONS AND PROGRESS
ON SPECIFIC TRADE ISSUES SUCH AS BEEF, CITRUS, AND NTT
PROCUREMENT HAVE BEEN ACCOMPLISHED IN RECENT MONTHS. THE
DRAMATIC DECLINE OF JAPAN'S CURRENT ACCOUNT SURPLUS, WHILE
RELATED TO OTHER FACTORS SUCH AS THE INCREASE IN CRUDE OIL
PRICES, ALSO REFLECTS AN ACTIVE EFFORT TO RESTORE BALANCE
TO JAPAN'S INTERNATIONAL TRANSACTIONS. WHILE A LARGE
TRADE SURPLUS WITH THE U.S. STILL REMAINS, THIS SURPLUS
APPEARS TO BE IN DECLINE AND U.S. EXPORTS TO JAPAN HAVE
INCREASED SHARPLY.
SINCE THE SIGNING OF SINO-JAPANESE PEACE AND FRIENDSHIP
TREATY (PFT) IN AUGUST 1978, THE PACE OF BILATERAL RELATIONS BETWEEN JAPAN AND THE PRC HAS PICKED UP CONSIDERABLY.
AN AGREEMENT IN PRINCIPLE TO DOUBLE OR TRIPLE THE ORIGINAL
COMMITMENTS REACHED IN THE SINO-JAPANESE LONG-TERM AGREEMENT (LTTA) HAS BEEN REACHED. A TOTAL OF $10 BILLION IN
JAPANESE EXIM BANK AND SYNDICATED BANK LOANS WAS EXTENDED
TO THE PRC EARLIER THIS YEAR TO ASSIST WITH CHINA'S MODERN-

DEVELOPMENT. THE GOJ WILL REVIEW THE SIZEABLE ($5.5

AS WELL AS THE INTERESTS OF OTHER DEVELOPING NATIONS,
PARTICULARLY ASEAN, AND THE VIEWS OF THE DEVELOPED NATIONS.
THE GOJ IS EXPECTED TO RESPOND TO THE CHINESE REQUEST BY

ISSUES. THERE IS GENERAL AGREEMENT TO SUPPORT CHINA'S
MODERNIZATION (EXCEPT IN THE MILITARY AREA) AND TO SEEK
WAYS TO COOPERATE WITH OTHER INDUSTRIALIZED DEMOCRACIES
IN THE CHINA MARKET. THE JAPANESE DO NOT SEEM EAGER TO
SEE INCREASED SALES OF SOPHISTICATED WEAPONRY TO CHINA,
HOWEVER, BELIEVING THAT A FULLY MODERN CHINESE MILITARY
WOULD BE A DESTABILIZING INFLUENCE IN THE AREA.
WHILE THE PRC WOULD OBVIOUSLY LIKE TOSTEER JAPAN AWAY
FROM ITS POLICY OF BALANCE IN RELATIONS WITH THE SOVIET
UNION AND CHINA, THE JAPANESE HAVEHELD TO THE PRINCIPLE
THAT RELATIONS WITH BEIJING ARE SEPARATE AND DISTINCT FROM
RELATIONS WITH MOSCOW. JAPAN HAS INSISTED THAT RELATIONSHIPS WITH EACH OF HER GIANT COMMUNIST NEIGHBORS ARE TO
BE PURSUED INDEPENDENTLY AND WITHOUT LINKAGES AND THAT
TOKYO WILL SEEK TO IMPROVE RELATIONS WITH BOTH.
JAPAN'S RELATIONS WITH THE SOVIET UNION, NEVER PARTICULARLY WARM, HAVE BLOWN TEPID, THEN COOLER IN RECENT MONTHS.
IN RESPONDING TO SOVIET CRITICISMS OF JAPAN'S SIGNING
OF THE PEACE AND FRIENDSHIP TREATY WITH CHINA, THE JAPANESE HAD INSISTED THAT THEIR POLICIES TOWARD MOSCOW AND
BEIJING WERE INDEPENDENT OF EACH OTHER. THE MAY VISIT OF
DEPUTY FOREIGN MINISTER FIRYUBIN SUGGESTED A CHANGE IN THE
SOVIET APPROACH TO JAPAN AND IT APPEARED THAT THERE WAS
SOME POSSIBILITY OF IMPROVED RELATIONS. THE TWO SIDES
AGREED IN PRINCIPLE TO CONTINUE THE VICE-MINISTERIAL TALKS
IN MOSCOW AND THE JAPANESE RENEWED AN INVITATION TO FOREIGN MINISTER GROMYKO TO VISIT JAPAN, A VISIT WHICH THE
JAPANESE WOULD REGARD AS A SIGN OF MOSCOW'S INTENT TO IMPROVE RELATIONS.

DESPITE THESE HOPEFUL SIGNS, THE NORTHERN TERRITORIES ISSUE REMAINED A MAJOR OBSTACLE TO CLOSER TIES BETWEEN TOKYO AND MOSCOW. IN JULY SOVIET AMBASSADOR POLYANSKIY RESTATED THE FACT THAT THE SOVIETS HAD NO INTENTION OF RETURNING THE CONTESTED ISLANDS TO JAPAN. REACTING TO
INCREASED PUBLIC CONCERN ABOUT RUMORS OF INCREASED SOVIET
MILITARY ACTIVITY IN THE NORTHERN TERRITORIES, FOREIGN
MINISTER SONODA VISITED HOKKAIDO EARLY LAST MONTH AND
AFTER CRUISING NEAR THE ISLANDS IN A JAPANESE PATROL
SHIP, ANNOUNCED THAT THE GOJ WOULD MAKE RENEWED EFFORTS
TO SEEK THE RETURN OF THE ISLANDS. THE SOVIETS RESPONDED
THAT SONODA'S ACTIONS COULD NOT BE INTERPRETED BY MOSCOW
AS A SIGN OF JAPAN'S WILLINGNESS TO IMPROVE RELATIONS.
RECENT COMPLAINT TO MOSCOW OVER ESTABLISHMENT OF A NEW
SOVIFT BASE IN SHIKOTAN, ONLY 80 KMS FROM HOKKAIDO, HAS
FUELED THE CONTROVERSY EVEN FURTHER.
JAPAN'S INTERESTS IN SOUTHEAST ASIA HAVE LED TO A POLICY
OF CLOSE COOPERATION WITH THE ASEAN NATIONS. THE FIVE
ASEAN NATIONS ARE OF MAJOR IMPORTANCE TO JAPAN ECONOMICALLY. IN POLITICAL TERMS, JAPAN CONSIDERS A STRONG
ASEAN TO BE THE KEY TO THE REGION'S FUTURE STABILITY. TOKYO HAS ATTEMPTED TO ENHANCE ITS TIES WITH THE AREA BY
GIVING AMOUNTS OF OVERSEAS DEVELOPMENT ASSISTANCE AND
EARLIER THIS YEAR ANNOUNCED THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE FIRST
JAPAN-ASEAN ECONOMIC COOPERATION PROJECT. THE ASEAN
NATIONS HAVE WELCOMED JAPANESE AID ALTHOUGH THERE IS STILL
SOME CONCERN ABOUT POSSIBLE ECONOMIC DOMINATION BY JAPAN.
JAPAN HAS SHARED ASEAN'S CONCERN ABOUT THE INSTABILITY

HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE TO THE PEOPLE OF KAMPUCHEA.
RECOGNIZING THE POTENTIAL DESTABILIZING OF THE REFUGEE
PROBLEM IN INDOCHINA, JAPAN HAS PARTICIPATED ACTIVELY IN
INTERNATIONAL EFFORTS TO ASSIST INDOCHINESE REFUGEES.
WHILE PROVIDING ONLY A LIMITED NUMBER OF PLACES FOR PERMANENT RESETTLEMENT OF INDOCHINESE REFUGEES, JAPAN HAS
MADE MAJOR CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE UNHCR PROGRAM FOR INDOCHINESE REFUGEES. JAPAN HAS PLEDGED TO UNDERWRITE HALF
OF THE CURRENT UNHCR BUDGET OR CARE AND MAINTENANCE OF
INDOCHINESE REFUGEES ANDHAS PLEDGED HALF OF THE COSTS
OF ESTABLISHING THE REFUGEE REPROCESSING CENTER (RPC) AT
GALANG IN INDONESIA.
THE SITUATION ON THE KOREAN PENINSULA WITH ITS IMPLICATIONS FOR PEACE AND STABILITY IN THE AREA REMAINS ONE
OF JAPAN'S FOREIGN POLICY PREOCCUPATIONS. JAPAN HOPES
THAT THE TRIPARTITE TALKS PROPOSED BY ROK PRESIDENT PARK
AND PRESIDENT CARTER WILL MATERIALIZE AND ARE COMMITTED
TO SEEKING POSSIBLE WAYS TO REDUCE NORTH-SOUTH TENSIONS

IN AREAS OF THE WORLD OUTSIDE OF EAST AND SOUTHEAST ASIA,
JAPAN CONSIDERS THE MIDDLE EAST A VITALLY IMPORTANT
AREA FOR JAPANESE INTERESTS. APPROXIMATELY 80 OF JAPAN'S
CRUDE OIL IMPORTS COME FROM THE MIDDLE EAST AND JAPAN'S
VULNERABILITY AND DEPENDENCE ON MIDDLE EAST SOURCES WERE
CLEARLY DEMONSTRATED IN THE 1973 ARAB OIL EMBARGO. THE
JAPANESE HAVE DEVELOPED EXPERTISE IN DEALING WITH THE
ARAB WORLD AND A SIGNIFICANT PROPORTION OF JAPANESE OVERSEAS DEVELOPMENT ASSISTANCE NOW GOES TO THE MIDDLE EAST.
NONETHELESS, THE JAPANESE HAVE EXPRESSED STRONG SUPPORT
FOR THE PEACE TREATY BETWEEN EGYPT AND ISRAEL AS THE FIRST
STEP IN A COMPREHENSIVE MIDDLE EAST SETTLEMENT, AND DESPITE PRESSURE FROM THE ARAB WORLD, HAVE CONTINUED THEIR
SIGNIFICANT ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS IN EGYPT. JAPAN HAS CALLED
FOR A FINAL PEACE SETTLEMENT WHICH WOULD IMPLEMENT UNSC

JAPAN WAS ALARMED BY THE SUDDEN COLLAPSE OF THE SHAH OF

PARTICIPATE IN A SUBSTANTIAL WAY IN THE UNTAG IN NAMIBIA,
PLEDGING BOTH PERSONNEL (CIVILIANS) AND EQUIPMENT FOR THE
EFFORT. JAPAN HAS ACTIVELY PARTICIPATED IN THE MEETINGS
OF THE DONOR'S GROUP FOR ZAIRE AND HAS EXTENDED SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS OF AID TO MOBUTU. JAPAN CONTINUES TO BE THE
SECOND LARGEST CONTRIBUTOR TO THE AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT
BANK.
JAPAN HAS ALSO ANNOUNCED ITS DESIRE TO BE MORE ACTIVE IN
LATIN AMERICA. FOREIGN MINISTER SONODA RECENTLY COMPLETED
A VISIT TO SIX LATIN AMERICAN NATIONS. THREE OF HIS
CABINET COLLEAGUES HAVE ALSO VISITED LATIN AMERICA IN RECENT MONTHS TO DISCUSS TRADE EXPANSION AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT.
AS CAN BE EXPECTED FROM THE WORLD'S SECOND LARGEST ECONOMIC POWER, JAPAN HAS BEEN DEVELOPING A MORE ASSERTIVE
FOREIGN POLICY WITH WIDER HORIZONS. WHILE JAPANESE POLICY
WILL ALWAYS CONCENTRATE ON THE NEED TO SECURE SUPPLIES OF
ESSENTIAL RESOURCES AND MARKETS, A LARGER POLITICAL ROLE
CAN BE EXPECTED AND IS WELCOME. DESPITE DIFFERENCES IN
LANGUAGE AND CULTURE, SIMILARITIES IN POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY
AND ECONOMIC STRUCTURE LEADS JAPAN TO THE PURSUIT OF OBJECTIVES COMMON TO THE WESTERN DEMOCRACIES.

THE PAST YEAR HAS BEEN A DECIDEDLY MIXED ONE FOR NORTH
KOREA. THE SINO-JAPANESE PFT UNPLEASANTLY SURPRISED
PYONGYANG, WHICH THEN SAW ITS PRINCIPAL ALLY, CHINA, MOVE
TOWARD ITS MAIN ADVERSARY, THE UNITED STATES, IN THE
NORMALIZATION PROCESS. WHILE THE ONSET OF SINO-AMERICAN
NORMALIZATION MAY HAVE INSPIRED NORTH KOREA'S TEMPORARY
WILLINGNESS TO EXPLORE DIALOGUE WITH SEOUL, THE MOST PROFOUND EXTERNAL DEVELOPMENT WAS THE CHINESE ATTACK ON
VIETNAM. THIS ACTION AGAINST A NEIGHBORING SOCIALIST
STATE AND FORMER CLOSE CHINESE ALLY REPORTEDLY ALARMED
PYONGYANG AND MAY HAVE AFFECTED PYONGYANG'S HABITUAL POSTURE OF FAVORING CHINA IN THE SINO-SOVIET SPLIT.

UNUSUALLY MODERATE COMPLEXION IN THE NON-ALIGNED MOVEMENT
(NAM), AS NORTH KOREA SUCCESSFULLY STROVE TO GAIN A SEAT
ON THE NAM'S COORDINATING COMMITTEE. IN THE HAVANA NAM
SUMMIT, NORTH KOREA LINED UP BEHIND YUGOSLAVIA IN TRYING
TO BLOCK THE VIETNAMESE-CUBAN EFFORTS TO PUSH THE NAM
INTO PRO-SOVIET STANCES. IT IS TOO EARLY TO PREDICT WHETHER MODERATION WILL APPEAR INCREASINGLY IN OTHER AREAS OF
NORTH KOREAN POLICY, ALTHOUGH WE ANTICIPATE LITTLE FLEXIBILITY IN PYONGYANG'S POSITIONS ON TROOP WITHDRAWAL AND

AT ABOUT FORTY DIVISIONS, THE FIFTH-LARGEST IN THE WORLD.
THAT ARMY CONTINUES TO BE OFFENSIVELY DEPLOYED FOR QUICK,
DECISIVE ATTACK ON SEOUL AND THE SOUTH, BUT THERE HAS
BEEN NO EVIDENCE, POLITICAL OR MILITARY, OF PYONGYANG'S
IMMINENT INTENTION TO STRIKE.
KIM IL-SONG CONTINUES TO RULE THE DPRK IN AN AUTOCRATIC,

IN 1979 THE CONSUMER PRICE INDEX HAS INCREASED MORE THAN

ROKG HAS ADOPTED TRADITIONAL ANTI-INFLATION MEASURES AND
APPLIED THEM WITH DETERMINATION: MONEY SUPPLY GROWTH
HAS BEEN HELD TO A MINIMUM, THE CENTRAL GOVERNMENT HAS
RUN A SUBSTANTIAL SURPLUS, AND IMPORTS HAVE BEEN LIBERALIZED. WHILE THESE MEASURES HAVE SQUEEZED MOST OF THE
NON-FUEL PRICE INFLATION OUT OF THE SYSTEM, EACH HAS HAD
ITS UNPLEASANT SIDE EFFECTS: MORE BUSINESS FAILURES,
POSTPONED SOCIAL PROJECTS AND A 1979 CURRENT ACCOUNT DEFICIT WHICH MAY REACH $6 BILLION. NEVERTHELESS, KOREA'S

US-KOREA RELATIONS HAVE IMPROVED DRAMATICALLY IN 1979.
KOREAGATE IS PAST, PRESIDENT CARTER HAS SUSPENDED, AT
LEAST UNTIL A REVIEW IN 1981, HIS PROGRAM FOR THE WITHDRAWAL OF U.S. GROUND COMBAT FORCES, AND THERE HAS BEEN
SOME TENTATIVE IMPROVEMENT IN THE HUMAN RIGHTS CLIMATE. THE
IMPROVEMENT IN THE OVERALL RELATIONSHIP WAS SYMBOLIZED
BY PRESIDENT CARTER'S VISIT TO SEOUL JUNE 29-JULY 1.
THE JULY 20 DECISION TO SUSPEND FURTHER TROOP WITHDRAWALS
WAS PROMPTED IN PART BY REVISED INTELLIGENCE ESTIMATES
OF NORTH KOREAN MILITARY STRENGTH WHICH SHOWED THAT GROUND
FORCES, ARMOR, FIREPOWER AND MOBILITY WERE ALL GREATER
THAN PREVIOUSLY BELIEVED. THE TIMING AND PACE OF FURTHER
WITHDRAWALS WILL BE RE-EXAMINED IN 1981. THAT RE-EXAMINATION WILL FOCUS ON THE RESTORATION OF A SATISFACTORY NORTHSOUTH M;LITARY BALANCE AND EVIDENCE OF TANGIBLE PROGRESS
TOWARD A REDUCTION OF TENSIONS ON THE PENINSULA. THE
SUSPENSION WAS WELCOMED IN SEOUL, TOKYO AND ELSEWHERE IN

NORTH KOREAN IMMEDIATE FLAT REJECTION, A POSITION THEY HAD
TAKEN ON SEOUL'S EARLIER CALLS FOR GOVERNMENT-TO-GOVERNMENT DIALOGUE. NORTH KOREA'S FAVORABLE RESPONSE CAME
SEVERAL DAYS LATER AND TWO MEETINGS OF &quot;LIAISON REPRESENTATIVES&quot; OF THE NORTH AND SOUTH DID TAKE PLACE AT PANMUNJOM IN MARCH, BUT THESE EFFORTS BROKE DOWN WHEN THE
NORTH PROVED RESOLUTE IN OPPOSITION TO MEETING BILATERALLY
WITH THE ROKG, PREFERRING A KOREAN MULTI-PARTY FORMAT
IN WHICH THE ROKG WOULD BE BUT ONE ELEMENT. PYONGYANG'S
INSISTENCE ON THIS MULTILATERAL APPROACH WOULD: 1) DETRACT FROM THE LEGITIMACY OF THE ROKG; 2) PREVENT REAL
PROGRESS ON TENSION-REDUCING MEASURES; AND 3) ASSUMING
UNACCEPTABLE TO THE ROKG, LEAVE NORTH KOREA THE PROPAGANDA ROLE OF INITIATOR AND WILLING PARTY FOR PAN-KOREAN
DISCUSSIONS. WHILE BOTH PYONGYANG AND SEOUL PROBABLY
LOST IMAGE IN THE COURT OF WORLD OPINION FOR PROVING UNABLE TO HAVE MORE THAN TWO SHORT MEETINGS AT PANMUNJOM,
NORTH KOREA HAS LOST FURTHER IMAGE WHILE SEOUL HAS GAINED

BEEN THAT THERE ARE TWO DISTINCT ISSUES WHICH MUST BE
TREATED IN SEPARATE CONFERENCES. ACCORDING TO THE DPRK,
THE QUESTION OF KOREAN REUNIFICATION CAN HAVE ONLY KOREAN
PARTIES PRESENT, BUT PYONGYANG REFUSES TO SIT DOWN BILATERALLY WITH SEOUL. PYONGYANG'S LEGALISTIC POSITION ON
MILITARY QUESTIONS IS THAT ONLY THE U.S. SIGNED THE
KOREAN ARMISTICE AND IS THEREFORE SOLELY ELIGIBLE TO DISCUSS THESE QUESTIONS WITH PYONGYANG (NORTH KOREA'S POSITION HAS SHOWN SOME FLEX IN ALLOWING SEOUL AS AN &quot;OBSERVER&quot;

FOR U.S.-NORTH KOREA TALKS, BUT THAT POSITION STILL MISSES

NATURE TO THE ROKG, WHICH MUST BE A FULL AND RECOGNIZED
PARTICIPANT IN ANY DISCUSSIONS FROM THE OUTSET).
NEITHER WE NOR THE SOUTH KOREANS HAVE CLOSED THE DOOR ON
THE JOINT PROPOSAL FOR TRILATERAL TALKS, AND WE ARE BOTH

HOPEFUL THAT PYONGYANG WILL EVENTUALLY AGREE TO PRESIDENT

VIII. THE SITUATION IN AFGHANISTAN
INTERNAL
HAFIZULLAH AMIN CAPPED HIS SEVENTEEN-MONTH RISE TO POWER
ON SEPTEMBER 16 BY ADDING NOOR MOHAMMAD TARAKI'S POSITIONS
AS PRESIDENT OF THE REVOLUTIONARY COUNCIL AND SECRETARY
GENERAL OF THE PEOPLE'S DEMOCRATIC PARTY (PDPA) TO HIS
PREVIOUS JOBS AS PRIME MINISTER AND ACTING DEFENSE MINISTER. IN THE PROCESS, HOWEVER, HE HAS NARROWED THE BASE
OF SUPPORT FOR HIS REGIME AND COULD FACE CHALLENGES BOTH
FROM WITHIN THE PDPA AND FROM THE MILITARY. HE ALSO
CONFRONTS A CONTINUING INSURGENCY WHICH HAS SUCCESSFULLY
DENIED TO THE GOVERNMENT CONTROL OVER SUBSTANTIAL AREAS
OF THE AFGHAN COUNTRYSIDE. MILITARY MORALE HAS DETERIORATED AND COMBAT UNITS ARE PLAGUED BY SEVERE MANPOWER PROBLEMS BROUGHT ABOUT THROUGH CASUALTIES, DEFECTIONS, DESERTIONS, MUTINIES, AND CONTINUING PURGES OF THE OFFICER
CORPS.
AMIN IS ATTEMPTING TO GIVE HIS REGIME A NEW IMAGE OF
SECRET
SECRET
PAGE 47

STATE 263929

MODERATION, LEGALITY AND JUSTICE AS HE SEEKS TO CONSOLIDATE HIS POWER, BUT HIS IDENTIFICATION WITH PAST DRA POLICIES, INCLUDING A DEPLORABLE HUMAN RIGHTS RECORD, MAY
LIMIT THE CREDIBILITY AND APPEAL OF THIS MORE CONCILIATORY
APPROACH. HE IS ALSO LIKELY TO CONFRONT INCREASING ECONOMIC PROBLEMS AS DEVELOPMENT SLOWS AND OTHER DISLOCATIONS
DUE TO THE INSRUGENCY RESULT IN SHORTAGES AND PRICE RISES.
SOVIET INVOLVEMENT
THE SOVIET ROLE AS A KEY PROP TO THE AFGHAN REGIME HAS
GROWN OVER THE PAST YEAR. HOWEVER, WE HAVE NO EVIDENCE
THEY ENGINEERED RECENT CHANGES IN KABUL AND A NUMBER OF
INDICATIONS THEY WERE PROBABLY CAUGHT BY SURPRISE.
WE NOW ESTIMATE THAT THERE ARE BETWEEN 2,500 AND 3,500
SOVIET MILITARY ADVISERS AND PERHAPS 3,000 CIVILIAN
ADVISERS IN AFGHANISTAN. ADVISERS ARE POSTED THROUGHOUT
THE AFGHAN MILITARY AT LEAST DOWN TO THE BATTALION LEVEL
AND AT WORKING LEVELS IN THE CIVILIAN BUREAUCRACY. WITHIN
THE MILITARY, SOVIET ADVISERS PLAY KEY ROLES, INCLUDING
SOME COMMAND AND CONTROL FUNCTIONS. THERE ARE NUMEROUS

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
REPORTS, WHICH WE CAN NEITHER CONFIRM NOR DISPROVE, THAT
SOVIET PERSONNEL HAVE FLOWN AT LEAST SOME COMBAT MISSIONS
FOR THE AFGHAN AIR FORCE. SOVIETS ARE PROBABLY PROVIDING
SECURITY AT BAGRAM AIR BASE AND PERHAPS AT SOME LOCATIONS
IN KABUL. IN ADDITION TO THEIR EXTENSIVE ADVISORY ROLE,
THE SOVIETS HAVE PROVIDED SUBSTANTIAL MILITARY AID, INCLUDING MIG-21'S, TANKS, ARMORED PERSONNEL CARRIERS, AND
MI-24 ASSAULT HELICOPTERS. THERE ARE ALSO UNCONFIRMED
REPORTS OF THE USE OF NAPALM ON AFGHAN VILLAGES.
THERE WERE SIGNS OF INCREASED SOVIET MILITARY ACTIVITY
NORTH OF THE USSR-AFGHANISTAN BORDER COINCIDENT WITH
THE SEPTEMBER 14-16 EVENTS IN KABUL WHICH RESULTED IN
AMIN'S REPLACEMENT OF TARAKI. WE COULD NOT BE CERTAIN
SECRET
SECRET
PAGE 48

STATE 263929

ABOUT THE PURPOSE OF THIS ACTIVITY WHICH COULD HAVE BEEN
ASSOCIATED WITH CONTINGENCY PLANNING FOR POSSIBLE SOVIET
INTERVENTION TO SECURE PERSONNEL OR INSTALLATIONS OR MORE
DIRECT SOVIET INVOLVEMENT IN THE POLITICAL SCENE. WE REMAIN CONCERNED THAT THE SOVIETS COULD BE TEMPTED TO TAKE
A MORE DIRECT ROLE IN THE AFGHAN CIVIL WAR, ESPECIALLY
IF THE VOLATILE ENVIRONMENT IN KABUL SHOULD LEAD TO
CLASHES BETWEEN OPPOSING MILITARY ELEMENTS OR CIVIL UNREST.
AFGHAN FOREIGN POLICY
AFGHANISTAN HAS CLEARLY POSITIONED ITSELF AMONG THE MOST
RADICAL OF THE NONALIGNED STATES, TAKING POSITIONS GENERALLY SUPPORTIVE OF MOSCOW'S INTERESTS. INDO-AFGHAN RELATIONS
REMAIN GENERALLY GOOD ALTHOUGH THE INDIANS PRIVATELY
EXHIBIT CONCERN OVER THE SOVIET ROLE IN AFGHANISTAN.
AFGHANISTAN'S RELATIONS WITH ITS OTHER NEIGHBORS -- PAKISTAN, IRAN AND CHINA -- ARE STRAINED. WITH PAKISTAN THE
SITUATION IS COMPLICATED BY THE EXODUS OF ALMOST 200,000
AFGHAN REFUGEES INTO PAKISTAN AND THE PRESENCE OF SEVERAL
COMPETING REBEL GROUPS IN THE BORDER AREAS OF PAKISTAN.
U.S.-AFGHAN RELATIONS CONTINUE TO BE COOL; SECURITY CONCERNS REQUIRED US TO EVACUATE OFFICIAL DEPENDENTS AND NONESSENTIAL EMPLOYEES FROM OUR EMBASSY IN MID-SUMMER.
THE PROGNOSIS
THE HIGHLY VOLATILE POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT IN KABUL COULD
LEAVE TO MILITARY OR INTERNAL PARTY CHALLENGES TO PRESIDENT AMIN. SUCH OPPOSITION FROM WITHIN WOULD REPRESENT
A SERIOUS THREAT, ESPECIALLY IF ONE OR MORE OF THE MILISECRET

TARY OFFICERS OUSTED FROM THE CABINET ON SEPTEMBER 14
(E.G.WATANJAR, MAZDOORYAR) ARE AT LARGE. AT THE SAME
TIME, INSURGENTS REMAIN ACTIVE IN THE COUNTRYSIDE BUT
WITHOUT ANY AGREED-UPON LEADERSHIP OR PROGRAM. THEY
HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO UNITE OR TO COORDINATE MILITARY ACTIVITIES. HOWEVER, THEY WILL CONTINUE TO SAP THE STRENGTH
OF THE AFGHAN ARMY WHOSE LOYALTY AND WILLINGNESS TO FIGHT
ARE ESSENTIAL TO THE REGIME'S SURVIVAL. ADDITIONAL MUTINIES AND LARGE-SCALE DEFECTIONS COULD LEAD TO FURTHER
UNRAVELING OF THE ARMY AND PERHAPS STIMULATE MILITARY
CHALLENGES TO THE AMIN REGIME. THE SOVIETS ARE FACED
WITH A CONTINUING DILEMMA OF HOW EXTENSIVELY THEY SHOULD
GET INVOLVED WITH A REGIME WHICH FACES A GENERALLY HOSTILE
POPULATION CONCERNED ABOUT ITS ANTI-ISLAMIC AND PRO-SOVIET
CHARACTER. ANY PROGNOSIS MUST ANTICIPATE FURTHER TURMOIL
AND PERHAPS SIGNIFICANT ADDITIONAL POLITICAL CHANGES.
DURING THE COMING WINTER BOTH SIDES IN THE INTERNAL
CONFLICT WILL HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO REGROUP FOR WHAT
COULD BE PROLONGED STRIFE.
IX. THE SITUATION IN INDIA AND PAKISTAN
INDIA
TWO DEVELOPMENTS DURING THE PAST YEAR WILL HAVE A MAJOR
IMPACT ON INDIA'S FUTURE -- THE CALL FOR GENERAL ELECTIONS AND HEIGHTENED INTERNATIONAL CONCERN ABOUT PAKISTAN'S NUCLEAR ACTIVITES.
AT THIS POINT, IT STILL IS TOO EARLY TO PREDICT THE OUTCOME OF INDIA'S GENERAL ELECTIONS, NOW EXPECTED TO BE HELD
IN DECEMBER. ALTHOUGH MOST OBSERVERS PREDICT MRS. GANDHI
WILL BE THE MAJOR GAINER, AT THIS TIME FEW PEOPLE EXPECT
HER TO EMERGE WITH AN ABSOLUTE MAJORITY.
THE ELECTIONS ARE QUICKLY TURNING INTO A THREE-WAY CONSECRET
SECRET
PAGE 50

STATE 263929

TEST AND SEEM TO BE TURNING MORE ON RIVAL PERSONALITIES-I.E., PRIME MINISTERIAL CONTENDERS -- THAN IN ANY PREVIOUS
INDIAN RACE. IN ONE CORNER IS MRS. CANDHI, WHO IS PROJECTING AN IMAGE AS THE SOLE LEADER TO RESTORE POLITICAL
AND ECONOMIC STABILITY TO THE COUNTRY. THE SECOND MAJOR
FORCE IS THE JANATA PARTY, NOW UNDER THE LEADERSHIP OF
FORMER DEFENSE MINISTER JAGJIVAN RAM. THE JANATA HAS

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
APPEARED UNCERTAIN ABOUT HOW TO PITCH ITS POPULAR APPEAL.
ITS ESSENTIALLY NEGATIVE APPROACH REFLECTS ITS BRIEF
HISTORY; IT STANDS AGAINST DICTATORSHIP AND DEFECTIONS.
SOME PREDICT THAT AT THE PROPER MOMENT RAM -- NOTED AS A
MASTER OF POLITICAL TIMING -- WILL THROW HIS SUPPORT TO
MRS. CANDHI AND LEAVE BEHIND THE NOW-DOMINANT JANA SANGH
GROUP IN JANATA. (HIS PRIZE FOR DOING SO WOULD BE THE
PRIME MINISTERSHIP.)
THE THIRD MAJOR FORCE IS THE ALLIANCE OF CARETAKER PRIME
MINISTER CHARAN SINGH AND HIS JANATA-S PARTY, THE OLDLINE CONGRESS PARTY (NOW UNDER THE LEADERSHIP OF DEVRAJ
URS), AND THE FIVE LEFTIST AND COMMUNIST PARTIES THAT
HAVE ALLIED WITH THEM. SINGH'S APPEAL IS TO CASTE AND
RURAL ELEMENTS. DESPITE HIS ALLIANCES, HE ALSO IS RUNNING
AGAINST THIRTY YEARS OF NEHRUVIAN POLICIES THAT FAVORED
INDUSTRIAL OVER AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT, THE URBAN POPULATION OVER THE RURAL, AND THE UPPER AND LOWER CASTES
OVER THE INCREASINGLY VOCAL MIDDLE CLASSES.
POSSIBLE INDIAN REACTION TO PAKISTANI NUCLEAR ACTIVITIES
REPRESENTS THE SECOND MAJOR QUESTION MARK IN INDIA'S
FUTURE. TO DATE, MOST INDIANS HAVE REACTED RATHER CALMLY
TO INFORMATION THAT PAKISTAN IS SEEKING TO DEVELOP A
NUCLEAR EXPLOSIVE CAPABILITY. SOME HAVE EVEN GONE SO
FAR AS TO SAY THAT THE US IS PLAYING UP PAKISTANI ACTIVISECRET
SECRET
PAGE 51

STATE 263929

TIES IN ORDER TO FORCE INDIA TO ACCEPT SAFEGUARDS ON ALL
OF ITS NUCLEAR ACTIVITIES OR TO PAVE THE WAY TO JUSTIFY
FUTURE ARMS SALES TO PAKISTAN. OVER THE LONG RUN, HOWEVER,
INDIAN REACTION MAY BE QUITE DIFFERENT, AND OUR CONCERN
THAT A CONTINUED PAKISTANI PUSH FOR AN EXPLOSIVE CAPABILITY COULD REVIVE THE INDIAN EXPLOSIVES PROGRAM AND
SET OFF A NUCLEAR RACE IN THE SUBCONTINENT IS VERY REAL.
PAKISTAN
THE POLITICAL SITUATION IS TENSE AS PAKISTAN PREPARES FOR
NATIONAL ELECTIONS SCHEDULED FOR NOVEMBER 17. IF HELD
THESE ELECTIONS WOULD RETURN THE COUNTRY TO CIVILIAN RULE.
PARTY REGISTRAION WAS TO HAVE BEEN COMPLETED SEPTEMBER 30,
HOWEVER ONLY ONE MAJOR PARTY REGISTERED FOR THE ELECTION.
IT IS NOT AT ALL CLEAR HOW AN ELECTION CAN BE HELD IF
MOST OF THE MAJOR PARTIES REFUSE TO PARTICIPATE.
THE MAJOR POLITICAL PARTY IN PAKISTAN IS THE PAKISTAN
PEOPLE'S PARTY (PPP), HEADED BY NUSRAT BHUTTO, THE WIDOW
OF THE LATE PRIME MINISTER. IN LOCAL ELECTIONS HELD IN

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
LATE SEPTEMBER THE PPP WON IMPRESSIVE VICTORIES IN THREE
OF THE COUNTRY'S FOUR PROVINCES. IF PRESIDENT ZIA DETERMINES THAT THE PPP WOULD WIN A NATIONAL ELECTION, HE MIGHT
TRY TO CANCEL THE ELECTION OR AT LEAST SLIP THE DATE.
HOWEVER SUCH A MOVE COULD CAUSE CONSIDERABLE UNREST AND
VIOLENCE POSSIBLY LEADING TO COUP ATTEMPTS.
PAKISTAN HAS FOR A LONG TIME WISHED TO JOIN THE NON-ALIGNED MOVEMENT. THE COLLAPSE OF CENTO REMOVED THE LAST
BARRIER TO NAM MEMBERSHIP AND PAKISTAN WAS OFFICIAL
ANNOINTED AT THE RECENT HAVANA CONFERENCE. RELATIONS
WITH AFGHANISTAN REMAIN SEVERELY TROUBLED AND ARE COMPLICATED BY ABOUT 200,000 AFGHAN REFUGEES WHO ARE NOW RESIDING IN PAKISTAN. THE GOVERNMENT OF PAKISTAN BELIEVES
SECRET
SECRET
PAGE 52

STATE 263929

THAT AFGHANISTAN FOR ALL PRACTICAL PURPOSES HAS BECOME
A SOVIET SATELLITE AND REPRESENTS A SERIOUS LONG-TERM
SECURITY THREAT. PAKISTAN IS ALSO CONCERNED OVER THE
CHAOTIC SITUATION IN IRAN, BUT IS ON GOOD TERMS WITH THIS
NEIGHBORING ISLAMIC COUNTRY. PAKISTAN'S RELATIONS WITH
THE USSR REMAIN COOL BUT CORRECT.
- X. USSR AND PRC FOREIGN POLICY IN EASTERN AND SOUTHERN ASIA
SOVIET FOREIGN POLICY
THE SOVIET UNION CONTINUES TO DEFINE ITS FOREIGN POLICY
TOWARD ASIA LARGELY IN TERMS OF OPPOSITION TO THE PEOPLE'S
REPUBLIC OF CHINA. MOSCOW'S OVERRIDING PREOCCUPATION WITH
CONTAINMENT OF THE CHINESE THREAT, BOTH REAL AND POTENTIAL,
COLORS ITS RELATIONS WITH NORTH ASIAN STATES AND PROVIDES
THE BASIC JUSTIFICATION FOR A GROWING SOVIET MILITARY PRESENCE IN THE NORTHERN PACIFIC. IT ALSO PROVIDES THE MOTIVE FORCE BEHIND MOSCOW'S EFFORT TO EXPAND ITS INFLUENCE
IN SOUTHEAST ASIA BY PROVIDING UNQUALIFIED POLITICAL AND
MILITARY SUPPORT TO VIETNAM.
CHINA
ON APRIL 3, CHINA ANNOUNCED ITS DECISION NOT TO RENEW ITS
THIRTY-YEAR OLD TREATY OF FRIENDSHIP, ALLIANCE AND MUTUAL
ASSISTANCE WITH THE USSR. THE ACTION WAS EXPECTED SINCE
VICE PREMIER DENG HAD PROMISED THE JAPANESE (IN THE CONTEXT OF NEGOTIATIONS ON THE SINO-JAPANESE PEACE AND FRIENDSHIP TREATY) THAT HE WOULD ALLOW THE TREATY TO EXPIRE.
HOWEVER, BEIJING'S SIMULTANEOUS CALL FOR NEW SINO-SOVIET

STATE 263929

NEGOTIATIONS, AND MOSCOW'S SUBSEQUENT ACCEPTANCE, SET THE
STAGE FOR THE FIRST BROAD-BASED POLITICAL NEGOTIATIONS
BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES IN NEARLY TWO DECADES.
AFTER FIVE MONTHS OF PREPARATIONS, THE SOVIET-CHINESE
TALKS OPENED IN MOSCOW ON SEPTEMBER 27. ALTHOUGH THE
AGENDA WAS NOT SET IN ADVANCE, BOTH SIDES DID INDICATE
INTEREST IN PRODUCING A NEW POLITICAL DOCUMENT SETTING
FORTH THE &quot;BASIC PRINCIPLES&quot; OF SOVIET-CHINESE RELATIONS
IN TERMS CALCULATED TO REDUCE TENSIONS. THEY ALSO EXPRESSED A MUTUAL WILLINGNESS TO CONSIDER INCREASED COMMERCIAL,
SCIENTIFIC AND CULTURAL EXCHANGES AND A GENERAL IMPROVEMENT IN THEIR BILATERAL CONTACTS.
THERE IS LITTLE POSSIBILITY, HOWEVER, THAT THE MOSCOW
TALKS WILL RESULT IN ANY SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT IN SOVIETCHINESE RELATIONS. DEEP SEATED ANIMOSITIES DIVIDE THE TWO
COUNTRIES, WHILE OFFICIALS ON BOTH SIDES HAVE TAKEN PAINS
TO HOLD DOWN EXPECTATIONS. GIVEN A PRIOR AGREEMENT TO CONSIDER THE EXPLOSIVE TOPIC OF &quot;HEGEMONY&quot; AND CHINESE INTENTIONS TO DISCUSS &quot;KAMPUCHEA&quot; AND THE SOVIET-CHINESE
BORDER, THE TALKS COULD DEGENERATE INTO THE KIND OF SHOUTING MATCHES THAT HAVE CHARACTERIZED CHINA'S NEGOTIATIONS
WITH VIETNAM. MORE LIKELY, HOWEVER, THE TALKS WILL BE
PROLONGED WITH BOTH SIDES TRYING TO APPEAR REASONABLE
ENOUGH TO OBTAIN MAXIMUM POLITICAL AND PROPAGANDA ADVANTAGE.
FOR THE SOVIETS, THE TALKS WILL ALLOW THEM TO PRESENT
THEIR CASE AGAINST CHINA AND, HOPEFULLY, MITIGATE CHINESE
PRESSURE AGAINST VIETNAM. HOWEVER, MOSCOW WILL NOT ALTER
ITS RELATIONSHIP WITH HANOI OR MAKE CHANGES IN ITS MILITARY POSTURE ON THE BORDER. THE SOVIETS MAY ALSO SEE
NEGOTIATIONS WITH CHINA AS PROVIDING SOME LEVERAGE IN
THEIR RELATIONSHIP WITH THE U.S. AND AS A MEANS OF RETARDING THE DEVELOPMENT OF US-CHINESE RELATIONS.

VIETNAM
AS THE SOVIET UNION'S ONLY REGIONAL ALLY, VIETNAM SERVES
AS A CORNERSTONE OF MOSCOW'S POLICY OF CONTAINING THE
SPREAD OF CHINESE INFLUENCE IN SOUTHEAST ASIA. IN THIS
CONTEXT, MOSCOW CONCLUDED THE SOVIET-VIETNAMESE FRIEND-

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
SHIP TREATY IN NOVEMBER 1978, SUPPORTED HANOI'S INVASION
OF KAMPUCHEA, RECOGNIZED THE HENG SAMRIN REGIME, AND SUPPORTED VIETNAMESE TIGHTENING OF ITS CONTROL IN LAOS.
DURING THE SINO-VIETNAMESE WAR, THE SOVIETS INITIATIED
AIR AND SEA LIFT OF MILITARY SUPPLIES, STATIONED A FLOTILLA OF NAVAL VESSELS OFF THE VIETNAMESE COAST, AND LAUNCHED
A VICIOUS PROPAGANDA CAMPAIGN AGAINST CHINA.
ALREADY THIS YEAR, THE SOVIET UNION HAS SUPPLIED VIETNAM
WITH SEVERAL TIMES THE AMOUNT OF MILITARY EQUIPMENT IT
DID IN 1978. SOVIET AIRCRAFT ARE TRANSFERRING MILITARY
SUPPLIES INSIDE VIETNAM AND INTO LAOS AND KAMPUCHEA.
SOVIET NAVAL VESSELS HAVE CALLED AT CAM RANH BAY AND
RECONNAISSANCE AIRCRAFT HAVE PERIODICALLY DEPLOYED TO
VIETNAM.
AT THE SAME TIME SOVIET MEDIA HAVE SOUGHT TO DEFLECT INTERNATIONAL CRITICISM OF VIETNAMESE ACTIONS IN KAMPUCHEA
AND ITS EXPULSION OF HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF REFUGEES.
MOSCOW CAN NOW BE EXPECTED TO CONTINUE THIS DUAL POLICY
OF PROTECTING HANOI IN INTERNATIONAL FORA, WHILE SUPPLYING
THE MILITARY MEANS FOR REALIZING ITS AMBITIONS IN INDOCHINA. EFFORTS TO SEAT THE HENG SAMRIN REGIME AT INTERNATIONAL MEETINGS WILL THUS BE COUPLED WITH THE HOPE THAT
VIETNAM'S DRY SEASON OFFENSIVE WILL FINISH POL POT AND
HAND CHINA A MAJOR DEFEAT IN KAMPUCHEA.
SECRET
SECRET
PAGE 55

STATE 263929

ON THE REFUGEE QUESTION, THE SOVIETS WILL MAINTAIN THEIR
CLAIM THAT THE US AND CHINA ARE USING THIS ISSUE TO PRESSURE HANOI AND AS AN EXCUSE TO STATION US NAVAL UNITSIN
VIETNAMESE WATERS. MOSCOW WILL NOT CONTRIBUTE TO INTERNATIONAL RELIEF EFFORTS OR ACCOMMODATE REQUESTS THAT IT
INFLUENCE HANOI TO CONTROL THE OUTFLOW OF REFUGEES.
IN RETURN, THE SOVIETS WILL PRESS FOR INCREASED USE OF
VIETNAMESE MILITARY FACILITIES. SINCE HANOI'S CURRENT
OFFENSIVE IN KAMPUCHEA INCREASES THE DANGER OF RENEWED
CHINESE HOSTILITIES, IT WILL HAVE LITTLE OPTION BUT TO
REMAIN DEPENDENT ON SOVIET SUPPORT THUS ENHANCING MOSCOW'S
LEVERAGE ON HANOI. SHOULD THE CHINESE DECIDE TO &quot;TEACH
VIETNAM A SECOND LESSON,&quot; THE SOVIETS ARE AGAIN MOST
LIKELY TO AID THE VIETNAMESE IN VIETNAM. HOWEVER, THEY
HAVE BEEN CAREFUL NOT TO RULE OUT THE POSSIBILITY OF DIRECT COUNTER ACTION ON THE SOVIET-CHINESE BORDER.
JAPAN

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
SINCE THE ADVENT OF THE OHIRA GOVERNMENT IN DECEMBER, 1978,
THE SOVIETS HAVE ATTEMPTED TO REFURBISH THEIR RELATIONS
WITH JAPAN AND IMPROVE THEIR TIES WITH A BROAD SPECTRUM
OF JAPANESE POLITICAL FIGURES. THESE EFFORTS PEAKED IN
MAY DURING THE VISIT OF SOVIET VICE FOREIGN MINISTER
FIRYUBIN TO TOKYO. WHILE IT PRODUCED FEW SURPRISES,
THE VISIT WAS THE FIRST BY A RANKING SOVIET OFFICIAL FOLLOWING THE SIGNING OF THE SINO-JAPANESE PEACE AND FRIENDSHIP TREATY AND BOTH SIDES WERE PLEASED THAT IT TOOK PLACE.
MOSCOW'S EFFORT FOR A RETURN TO NORMALCY WAS ENHANCED BY
THE DISSIPATION OF JAPAN'S &quot;CHINA EUPHORIA&quot; FOLLOWING
BEIJING'S &quot;REAPPRAISAL&quot; OF SEVERAL LARGE EXPORT CONTRACTS
AND BE SHOCK FELT IN JAPAN OVER CHINA'S INVASION OF VIETNAM.
SECRET
SECRET
PAGE 56

STATE 263929

SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN SOVIET-JAPANESE RELATIONS CONTINUED TO BE CHECKED, HOWEVER, BY SOVIET UNWILLINGNESS
TO CONSIDER THE RETURN OF THE &quot;NORTHERN TERRITORIES&quot; TO
JAPAN. PUBLIC DISCLOSURE OF A SOVIET MILITARY BUILDUP
ON THE FOUR ISLANDS NORTH OF HOKKAIDO AND FOREIGN MINISTER
SONODA'S SEPTEMBER VISIT TO THE AREA HAVE AGAIN FOCUSSED
JAPANESE ATTENTION ON MOSCOW'S INTRANSIGENCE. THE SOVIETS REACTED NEGATIVELY TO JAPAN'S SUSPENSION OF ECONOMIC
AID TO HANOI FOLLOWING THE KAMPUCHEA INVASION AND TO
JAPANESE CRITICISM OF SOVIET UTILIZATION OF VIETNAMESE
MILITARY FACILITIES. TOKYO'S EXPANDING RELATIONS WITH
BEIJING BROUGHT SOVIET MEDIA CHARGES OF AN EMERGING &quot;USCHINESE-JAPANESE ALLIANCE&quot; AGAINST THE SOVIET UNION.
KOREA
US-SOUTH KOREAN PROPOSALS FOR TRIPARTITE TALKS ON A KOREAN
PEACE SETTLEMENT TRIGGERED NEW SOVIET INTEREST IN PENINSULA AFFAIRS AND NEW SIGNS OF MOSCOW'S INTEREST IN IMPROVING SOVIET-NORTH KOREAN RELATIONS. FOLLOWING PYONGYANG'S
LEAD, MOSCOW DENOUNCED THE PROPOSAL AND ACCUSED CHINA OF
COOPERATING WITH US IMPERIALISM IN &quot;FIXING THE DIVISION
OF KOREA.&quot; A POLITBURO LEVEL NORTH KOREAN PARTY DELEGATION VISITED MOSCOW IN JUNE AND THE SOVIET-NORTH KOREAN
JOINT ECONOMIC COMMISSION MET THIS SUMMER FOR THE FIRST
TIME IN TWO YEARS. IN RESPONSE, MESSAGES FROM PYONGYANG
HAVE HINTED AT NORTH KOREAN INTEREST IN BETTER TIES WITH
THE SOVIETS.
DESPITE PYONGYANG'S PRESENT &quot;TILT&quot; TOWARD CHINA, NORTH
KOREA REMAINS A VALUABLE SOVIET ASSET IN NORTHEAST ASIA.

AS A RESULT, MOSCOW HAS BEEN CAUTIOUS IN ITS CONTACTS
WITH SOUTH KOREA FOR FEAR OF DRIVING THE NORTH EVEN
FURTHER INTO THE CHINESE CAMP. IN THE PAST YEAR, THE
SOVIETS HAVE WELCOMED SOUTH KOREAN REPRESENTATIVES TO
INTERNATIONAL MEETINGS HELD IN THE USSR, BUT HAVE STOPPED
SHORT OF DIRECT COMMERCIAL OR POLITICAL CONTACTS WITH
SEOUL FOR FEAR OF FURTHER ALIENATING PYONGYANG. THIS
PRACTICE CAN BE EXPECTED TO CONTINUE.
IN THE FUTURE, SOVIET EFFORTS TO IMPROVE THEIR RELATIONS
WITH NORTH KOREA WILL CONTINUE TO BE RESTRAINED BY MOSCOW'S UNWILLINGNESS TO DISTURB THE STATUS QUO ON THE
PENINSULA. MAJOR DELIVERIES OF SOVIET MILITARY EQUIPMENT
CEASED IN 1973. RESUMPTION OF SOVIET MILITARY ASSISTANCE,
ESPECIALLY THE DELIVERY OF ADVANCED AIRCRAFT, WOULD PROVIDE A MAJOR FILLIP TO RELATIONS, BUT WOULD RISK GIVING
KIM IL-SONG THE MEANS TO LAUNCH A NEW KOREAN WAR. THE
SOVIETS WILL CONTINUE TO PROVIDE POLITICAL SUPPORT FOR
KIM'S GOAL OF KOREAN UNIFICATION BUT WILL WORK TO ENSURE
THAT USSR PARTICIPATION IN THE PROCESS SO THAT NO SETTLEMENT WILL BE CONCLUDED AT SOVIET EXPENSE.
