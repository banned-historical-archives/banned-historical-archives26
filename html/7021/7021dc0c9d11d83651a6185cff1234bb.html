		<h3>Tor</h3>
		<p><a href="https://www.torproject.org">Tor</a> is an encrypted anonymising network that makes it harder to intercept internet communications, or see where communications are coming from or going to.</p>
		<p>In order to use the WikiLeaks public submission system as detailed above you can download the Tor Browser Bundle, which is a Firefox-like browser available for Windows, Mac OS X and GNU/Linux and pre-configured to connect using the anonymising system Tor.</p>
		<h4>Tails</h4>
		<p>If you are at high risk and you have the capacity to do so, you can also access the submission system through a secure operating system called <a href="https://tails.boum.org">Tails</a>. Tails is an operating system launched from a USB stick or a DVD that aim to leaves no traces when the computer is shut down after use and automatically routes your internet traffic through Tor. Tails will require you to have either a USB stick or a DVD at least 4GB big and a laptop or desktop computer.</p>

		<h3>Tips</h3>
		<p>Our submission system works hard to preserve your anonymity, but we recommend you also take some of your own precautions. Please review these basic guidelines. </p>
		<div>
			<h4>1. Contact us if you have specific problems</h4>
			<p>If you have a very large submission, or a submission with a complex format, or are a high-risk source, please <a href="#submit_help_contact">contact us</a>. In our experience it is always possible to find a custom solution for even the most seemingly difficult situations.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h4>2. What computer to use</h4>
			<p>If the computer you are uploading from could subsequently be audited in an investigation, consider using a computer that is not easily tied to you. Technical users can also use <a href="https://tails.boum.org">Tails</a> to help ensure you do not leave any records of your submission on the computer.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h4>3. Do not talk about your submission to others</h4>
			<p>If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in source protection – it is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This includes other media organisations.</p>
		</div>

	</div>

		<h3>After</h3>

		<div>
			<h4>1. Do not talk about your submission to others</h4>
			<p>If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in source protection – it is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This includes other media organisations.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h4>2. Act normal</h4>
			<p>If you are a high-risk source, avoid saying anything or doing anything after submitting which might promote suspicion. In particular, you should try to stick to your normal routine and behaviour.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h4>3. Remove traces of your submission</h4>
			<p>If you are a high-risk source and the computer you prepared your submission on, or uploaded it from, could subsequently be audited in an investigation, we recommend that you format and dispose of the computer hard drive and any other storage media you used.</p>
			<p>In particular, hard drives retain data after formatting which may be visible to a digital forensics team and flash media (USB sticks, memory cards and SSD drives) retain data even after a secure erasure. If you used flash media to store sensitive data, it is important to destroy the media.</p>
			<p>If you do this and are a high-risk source you should make sure there are no traces of the clean-up, since such traces themselves may draw suspicion.</p>
			<div>
				<h4>4. If you face legal action</h4>
				<p>If a legal action is brought against you as a result of your submission, there are organisations that may help you. The Courage Foundation is an international organisation dedicated to the protection of journalistic sources. You can find more details at <a href="https://www.couragefound.org">https://www.couragefound.org</a>.</p>

		<p>WikiLeaks publishes documents of political or historical importance that are censored or otherwise suppressed. We specialise in strategic global publishing and large archives.</p>
		<p>The following is the address of our secure site where you can anonymously upload your documents to WikiLeaks editors. You can only access this submissions system through Tor. (See our <a href="#submit_help_tor">Tor tab</a> for more information.) We also advise you to read our <a href="#submit_help_tips">tips for sources</a> before submitting.</p>

			<!--<div>
				Copy this address into your Tor browser. Advanced users, if they wish, can also add a further layer of encryption to their submission using <a href="#submit_wlkey">our public PGP key</a>.
			</div>-->
		</div>

		<p>If you cannot use Tor, or your submission is very large, or you have specific requirements, WikiLeaks provides several alternative methods. <a href="#submit_help_contact">Contact us</a> to discuss how to proceed.</p>

SUMMARY:  WIRES BULLETIN PRES FORD WILL VISIT CHINA LATE
1975 COMMUNIQUE SAID.  MEDIA SAYS HAK WRAPS UP PEKING TRIP
WITHOUT SEEING MAO, GOES SIGHTSEEING IN SOUCHOW, HAK ARRIVES
TOKYO.

TOKYO (AP) -- PRESIDENT FORD WILL VISIT CHINA LATE IN 1975
IN A MOVE TO ACCELERATE U.S. RELATIONS WITH THE MAINLAND
AND TO BALANCE SOVIET LEADER LEONID BREZHNEV'S TRIP TO
WASHINGTON NEXT JUNE, A COMMUNIQUE SAID TODAY.

SHANGHAI (UPI) -- HAK ENDED A FIVE-DAY TRIP TO CHINA TODAY,
VIEWING ANCIENT GARDENS, TOURING AN EMBROIDERY FACTORY AND
EATING AT EVERY STOP ALONG THE WAY...AMERICAN OFFICIALS
REFUSED TO COMMENT ON MUCH OF THE TALKS, BUT SAID CHINA AND
THE UNITED STATES AGREED TO SKIRT THE MAJOR ISSUE DIVIDING
THEM -- U.S. RECOGNITION OF THE TAIWAN GOVERNMENT.

UNCLASSIFIED

PAGE 02  STATE  263171

NEWSMEN ASKED A U.S. OFFICIAL IF AMERICA'S TWO-CHINA POLICY
CAME UP DURING KISSINGER'S TALKS WITH PREMIER CHOU EN-LAI,
DEPUTY PREMIER TENG HSIAO-PING AND FOREIGN MINISTER CHOU

KUAN HUA.

&quot;WE'RE NOT PUSHING THAT,&quot; THE OFFICIAL SAID.

IS PEKING, WHICH CITES U.S. RECOGNITION OF TAIWAN AS THE
BAR TOWARD FULL SINO-AMERICAN RELATIONS, PRESSING IT?

&quot;THERE'S NO GREAT PRESSURE,&quot; SAID THE OFFICIAL...

THE SECRETARY SAID THE VISIT COMMITTED BOTH SIDES TO
SEEKING NORMALIZATION OF RELATIONS AND STRENGTHENED
AMERICA'S NEW ERA OF FRIENDSHIP WITH CHINA.

HE SAID THE TRIP GAVE HIM A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF CHINA'S
POINT OF VIEW AND HE PROMISED TO TAKE PEKING'S IDEAS INTO
ACCOUNT IN FORMING U.S. POLICY.

CHIAO, IN RETURN, PRAISED THE TALKS FOR INCREASING MUTUAL
UNDERSTANDING AND IMPROVING SINO-AMERICAN RELATIONS.

AP -- BARRY SCHWEID -- HAK, ON HIS WAY HOME FROM PEKING
WITHOUT SEEING CHAIRMAN MAO, MADE NO MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH
REGARDING TAIWAN DURING THIS TRIP TO THE CHINESE
CAPITAL...

TOKYO (AP) -- HAK ARRIVED IN TOKYO ON HIS WAY HOME FROM
CHINA TODAY.  HE IS TO MEET WITH JAPANESE FOREIGN MINIS-
TER TOSHIO KIMURA ON SATURDAY BEFORE FLYING TO WASHING-
TON.

ON HIS LAST DAY IN CHINA, KISSINGER VISITED THE ANCIENT
GARDEN CITY OF SOOCHOW.  THE CHINESE NEWS AGENCY SAID HE
WAS ACCOMPANIED BY FOREIGN MINISTER CHIAO KUAN-HUA AND HIS
DEPUTY WANG HAI-JUNG.

HSINHUA SAID KISSINGER LEFT CHINA FROM SHANGHAI AND WAS
SEEN OFF BY CHIAO, WANG AND OTHER CHINESE OFFICIALS AND
UNCLASSIFIED

GEORGE BUSH, CHIEF OF THE U.S. LIAISON OFFICE IN PEKING.

BEFORE THEIR DEPARTURE FROM HOME,  HSINHUA SAID, THE
AMERICANS WERE HONORED AT AN AIRPORT DINNER BY THE
SHANGHAI MUNICIPAL REVOLUTIONARY COMMITTEE.

TV/RADIO

1.  RICHARD VALERIANI -- NBC-TVTODAY: THIS HUGE COMPLEX
IS THE SOVIET UNION'S DIPLOMATIC COMPOUND IN PEKING.  IT
WAS BUILT BACK IN THE FIFTIES BEFORE THE TWO GIANTS OF
THE COMMUNIST WORLD CAME TO IDEOLOGICAL BLOWS.  FOR

SEVERAL YEARS NOW, CHINA AND THE SOVIET UNION HAVE LOOKED
AT EACH OTHER AS WORST ENEMIES AND DESPITE SOME RECENT
SPECULATION IN THE WESTERN PRESS ABOUT A POSSIBLE RECON-
CILIATION, NON-COMMUNIST DIPLOMATS HERE DO NOT SEE IT
HAPPENING ANYTIME SOON.  IT IS TRUE THAT THE RUSSIANS
AND THE CHINESE HAVE RECENTLY MODERATED THEIR MUTUAL
PROPAGANDA TIRADES; BUT THEY STILL CRITICIZE EACH AND
OTHER AND THEY ARE NOW TRYING TO OUT-PROPAGANDIZE EACH
OTHER BY MAKING PROPOSALS THAT THEY KNOW THE OTHER SIDE
WON'T ACCEPT, RATHER THAN JUST CALLING EACH OTHER NAMES.
IT IS ALSO TRUE THAT THE CHINESE HAVE STOPPED PLAYING UP
THE THREAT OF A RUSSIAN ATTACK, BUT WESTERN ANALYSTS
BELIEVE THAT IS BECAUSE THEY WANT TO REDUCE PRESSURE FROM TH
THE CHINESE MILITARY FOR A BIGGER CHUNK OF THE BUDGET
WHICH SUCH A THREAT WOULD REQUIRE.  SO WHILE THE
DIPLOMATIC ATMOSPHERE BETWEEN PEKING AND MOSCOW MAY HAVE
IMPROVED SOMEWHAT, THE BASIC CONFLICT BETWEEN THEM STILL
SHOWS NO REAL SIGNS THAT IT WILL BE RESOLVED IN THE
FORESEEABLE FUTURE.

2.  MARVIN KALB -- CBS RADIO -- TOKYO:  THE COMMUNIQUE
IS FOUR SENTENCES AND ONLY ONE WORD IN THE SECOND AND ALL
OF THE FOURTH ARE WORTH READING.  THE WORD IS 'FRANK'
SUGGESTING KISSINGER'S FOUR DAYS OF TALKS IN PEKING WENT
TO THE POINT TO SAY THE LEAST AND THE SENTENCE WORTH
READING IS THAT BOTH GOVERNMENTS HAVE AGREED THAT PRES-
IDENT FORD WILL VISIT CHINA IN 1975, THE PRESIDENT VISITED
RUSSIA LAST WEEKEND.  ONE SENIOR AMERICAN OFFICIAL TOLD
UNCLASSIFIED

PAGE 04  STATE  263171

REPORTERS ON THE FLIGHT INTO TOKYO FROM SHANGHAI TONIGHT
THAT THE TRIP WOULD TAKE PLACE AFTER BREZHNEV VISITS THE
U.S. NEXT JUNE; IN OTHER WORDS, IN THE SECOND HALF OF
1975.  IT IS CLEAR FROM THIS EXTRAORDINARILY BRIEF
COMMUNIQUE THAT BOTH SIDES, THE U.S. AND CHINA, COULD NOT
REACH ANY BASIC AGREEMENT ON BI-LATERAL ISSUES BUT THAT
THEY STILL WANTED TO DEMONSTRATE THEIR STRATEGIC
INTEREST IN USING THEIR RELATIONSHIP AS LEVERAGE AGAINST
RUSSIA, THAT IS WHY CHINA WANTS THE PRESIDENT TO VISIT
AND WHY THE PRESIDENT WANTS TO GO.

3.  KALB -- CBS RADIO: WHAT SEEMED TO BE A FACT YESTER-
DAY, IS TODAY.  HAK CAME TO CHINA BUT HE DID NOT GET HIS
MEETING WITH MAO.  THE CHINESE LEADER WHO HAS BEEN
UNUSUALLY AVAILABLE TO FOREIGN VISITORS IN RECENT MONTHS --
HE HAS SEEN EIGHT OF THEM -- DID NOT WANT TO SEE THE
SECRETARY OF STATE, A SIGN OF CHINESE DISPLEASURE WITH
THE PACE AND STYLE OF AMERICAN POLICY.  IT MIGHT ALSO HAVE
BEEN MAO'S WAY OF SAYING HE DID NOT LIKE THE IDEA OF A
SOVIET-AMERICAN SUMMIT TAKING PLACE AT THE DOORSTEP OF
CHINA TAKING PLACE LAST WEEK IN VLADIVOSTOK...

NEWSPAPERS

1.  WASHPOST -- OBERDORFER -- PAGE 20, PHOTO HAK TOASTING
CHIAO: THREE DAYS OF TALKS BETWEEN KISSINGER AND CHINESE
OFFICIALS APPEAR TO HAVE BROUGHT NO PROGRESS TOWARD
AGREEMENT ON THE STICKY QUESTION OF TAIWAN AND NO MAJOR
BREAKTHROUGH IN OTHER ASPECTS OF SINO-AMERICAN RELATIONS
...

PRESENT INDICATIONS ARE THAT KISSINGER WILL NOT BE GIVEN
AN AUDIENCE WITH COMMUNIST PARTY CHAIRMAN MAO TSE-TUNG.

WHILE THE ENTHUSIASM QUOTIENT DISPLAYED BY CHINESE LEADERS
IN THE PRESENCE  OF WESTERN JOURNALISTS WAS NOT VERY HIGH,
NEITHER WAS THERE ANY OPEN SIGN OF CRITICISM OF KISSINGER
OR HIS MISSION.

AS LONG AS THE SOVIETS REMAIN A POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS
ADVERSARY ALONG THE VAST NORTHERN BORDER, CHINA APPEARS
UNCLASSIFIED

PAGE 05  STATE  263171

DETERMINED TO MAINTAIN ITS THREE-YEAR-OLD RELATIONSHIP
WITH THE UNITED STATES.

A SENIOR AMERICAN MAINTAINED TONIGHT THAT THERE IS NO
GREAT PRESSURE FROM THE CHINESE SIDE WITH RESPECT TO THE
TAIWAN QUESTION, WHICH IS THE PRINCIPAL BARRIER TO THE
FULL NORMALIZATION OF SINO-AMERICAN RELATIONS.

IN THIS SITUATION THE UNITED STATES SEES NO REASON TO
PUSH FOR CHANGES REGARDING TAIWAN, THE OFFICIAL ADDED...

2.  NYTIMES -- LELYVELD -- PAGE ONE: KISSINGER TOLD HIS
CHINESE HOSTS TONIGHT THAT HE HAD ACHIEVED &quot;A BETTER
UNDERSTANDING&quot; OF THEIR VIEWPOINT ON HIS VISIT HERE AND
WOULD TAKE IT &quot;SERIOUSLY INTO ACCOUNT IN CONDUCTING OUR
FOREIGN POLICY.&quot;

UNLESS THERE IS A LAST-MINUTE CHANGE IN HIS SCHEDULE,
HE WILL LEAVE CHINA WITHOUT HAVING BEEN GRANTED AN
INTERVIEW WITH MAO TSE-TUNG, CHAIRMAN OF THE CHINESE
COMMUNIST PARTY.

AMERICAN OFFICIALS ARE POINTING OUT THAT A MEETING WITH
CHAIRMAN MAO IS NOT AUTOMATIC SINCE MR. KISSINGER IS NOT
A HEAD OF GOVERNMENT.

CHAIRMAN MAO HAS APPARENTLY NOT BEEN IN PEKING FOR FIVE
MONTHS.  HE IS NOT BELIEVED TO BE SOMEWHERE IN CENTRAL
CHINA, POSSIBLY IN HIS NATIVE HUNAN PROVINCE.

CHINESE OFFICIALS HAVE GONE TO GREAT LENGTHS TO KEEP
HIS PRECISE WHEREABOUTS SECRET, BUT HE CONTINUES TO RECEIVE
FOREIGN LEADERS.

INEVITABLY, IF MR. KISSINGER DOES NOT GET TO SEE MR. MAO
TOMORROW, DIPLOMATIC SPECULATION ABOUT CHINESE DISPLEASURE
WITH WASHINGTON WILL INTENSIFY.

IN HIS TOAST TONIGHT, MR. KISSINGER DECLARED THAT PROGRESS
HAD BEEN ACHIEVED DURING EACH OF HIS SEVEN VISITS HERE.
LATER, AN AMERICAN OFFICIAL INSISTED THAT THERE HAD BEEN
UNCLASSIFIED

PAGE 06  STATE  263171

NO GREAT PRESSURE FROM THE CHINESE SIDE ON THE TAIWAN
ISSUE.

THE OFFICIAL SAID THE UNITED STATES WAS NOT PRESSING FOR
NORMALIZATION AND ASKED WHETHER THERE WAS ANY REASON WHY
IT SHOULD.

THE CHINESE TOAST AT THE BANQUET, GIVEN BY THE NEW
FOREIGN MINISTER, CHIAO KUAN-HUA, SEEMED UNUSUALLY TERSE
AND UNDERSTATED.  UNLIKE MR. KISSINGER'S IT MADE NO
MENTION OF ANY PROGRESS.

A JOINT COMMUNIQUE WILL NOT BE MADE PUBLIC UNTIL THE
DEPARTURE OF MR. KISSINGER.  BUT IT ALREADY SEEMS CLEAR T
THAT NO AGREEMENT HAS BEEN REACHED ON THE LONG-STANDING
QUESTIONS OF CHINESE ASSETS FROZEN IN THE UNITED STATES
AND AMERICAN CLAIMS AGAINST THE CHINESE FOR PROPERTY
SEIZED AFTER THE COMMUNISTS CAME TO POWER IN 1949.

3.  BALTSUN -- TREWHITT -- PAGE ONE, PHOTO HAK AND FM
CHIAO AT TEMPLE OF HEAVEN: KISSINGER, THE SECRETARY
OF STATE, CLOSED FORMAL DISCUSSIONS WITH CHINESE
LEADERS YESTERDAY WITHOUT MAKING VISIBLE PROGRESS TOWARD
CLOSER TI:S BETWEEN THEIR TWO COUNTRIES...

THEY AGREED TO ISSUE A COMMUNIQUE SUMMING UP THEIR
CONVERSATIONS...IT APPEARED UNLIKELY THAT IT WOULD
CONTAIN ANY SURPRISES.

THE ABSENCE    OF ANNOUNCED AGREEMENTS DID NOT MEAN THE
ABSENCE OF SUBSTANCE IN THE DISCUSSIONS, HOWEVER, UNITED
STATES OFFICIALS INDICATED THE TWO GOVERNMENTS WERE
EAR AGREEMENT ON THE RELEASE OF COUNTERPART ASSETS HELD
BY EACH -- $80 MILLION BY THE U.S. AND $200 MILLION BY
CHINA.

&quot;THAT'S MORE A LEGAL AND TECHNICAL PROBLEM FOR THE
UNITED STATES NOW,&quot; ONE SOURCE SAID.

THEIR REVIEW OF BILATERAL AND INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS AT
TIMES WAS BRISK AND BLUNT.
UNCLASSIFIED

PAGE 07  STATE  263171

MR. CHIAO SIGNALED THE NATURE OF THOSE EXCHANGES BY
SAYING THEY WERE CARRIED OUT IN A &quot;CANDID SPIRIT,&quot; A CODE
PHRASE USUALLY MEANING DISAGREEMENT.

ONE CHINESE OFFICIAL WARNED PRIVATELY OF SOVIET BAD FAITH
IN THE PROJECTED STRATEGIC ARMS AGREEMENT ANNOUNCED LAST
WEEK.

A SENIOR AMERICAN OFFICIAL DISCOUNTED THE TAIWAN ISSUE.
&quot;THERE'S NO GREAT PRESSURE FROM THE CHINESE SIDE ON THAT,&quot;
HE SAID, &quot;AND WE'RE NOT PUSHING IT.  WHY SHOULD WE?&quot;

THE UPSHOT WAS THAT THE CHINESE SEEMED LESS PLEASED WITH
THE COURSE OF THE MEETINGS THAN MR. KISSINGER.  THE
DIMMING OUTLOOK FOR A MEETING BETWEEN MR. KISSINGER AND
CHAIRMAN MAO TSE-TUNG, THE CHINESE PATRIARCH, WAS SEEN BY
SOME OUTSIDERS AS ONE FRAGMENT OF EVIDENCE ON THAT SCORE
SINCE THE SECRETARY DID MEET CHAIRMAN MAO WHEN HE WAS
HERE A YEAR AGO.

HOWEVER, CHAIRMAN MAO IS ILL, AND IT WAS NOT CERTAIN

KISSINGER CONTINUES TO INSIST THAT THE CHINESE HAVE NOT
AND ARE NOT PRESSING HIM FOR ANY COMMITMENT TO
REMOVE THE MAIN ROADBLOCK TO FULL DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS:
THE CONTINUING U.S. POLITICAL AND SECURITY RELATIONSHIP

WITH THE CHINESE NATIONALIST GOVERNMENT ON TAIWAN.

YET DIPLOMATIC CIRCLES HERE ARE CONFIDENT SUCH PRESSURES
ARE BEING EXERTED OBLIQUELY, THROUGH COMPLAINTS TO THIRD
PARTY DELEGATIONS TO PEKING OR EVEN TO PRIVATE AMERICAN
CITIZENS WHO COULD BE EXPECTED TO PASS THE MESSAGE OF
DISSATISFACTION ON TO WASHINGTON.

KISSINGER HIMSELF HAS BECOME UNCHARACTERISTICALLY
IRRITATED WITH PRESS ACCOUNTS OF THESE REPORTED CHINESE
PRESSURES, ACCUSING REPORTERS OF TRAVELING WITH HIM OF
FABRICATING A&quot;CONFRONTATION&quot; BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES
AND CHINA.

LAST NIGHT, HE EXPLAINED IN HIS FORMAL TOAST, HIS
REMARKS WOULD BE BRIEF SO AS &quot;TO SPARE THE MENTAL AGILITY&quot;
OF THE PRESS CORPS...

KISSINGER AIDES ARE ALSO DEFENSIVE ABOUT THE LACK OF
A VISIT TO MAO.  THE CHAIRMAN, IT IS POINTED OUT, IS
ABSENT FROM PEKING ON A WORKING VISIT TO A STILL-UNKNOWN
REGION OF CENTRAL CHINA.

YET SEVERAL FOREIGN VISITORS HAVE SEEN HIM RECENTLY.
THE MOST RECENT WAS SALEM ROBAYA ALI, PRESIDENT OF
SOUTH YEMEN, WHO SAW MAO ON NOV. 12, JUST OVER TWO WEEKS
AGO.

IT IS ALSO POINTED OUT THAT KISSINGER, UNLIKE SOME OF THE
OTHER VISITORS SUCH AS SOUTH YEMEN'S PRESIDENT, IS NOT A
HEAD OF STATE.  BUT KISSINGER WAS NOT A HEAD OF STATE WHEN
HE SAW MAO A YEAR AGO...

FOR AMBASSADOR ANDERSON FROM S/PRS

NO. 8
SUMMARY:  WIRES BULLETIN PRES FORD WILL VISIT CHINA LATE
1975 COMMUNIQUE SAID.  MEDIA SAYS HAK WRAPS UP PEKING TRIP
WITHOUT SEEING MAO, GOES SIGHTSEEING IN SOUCHOW, HAK ARRIVES
TOKYO.

TOKYO (AP) -- PRESIDENT FORD WILL VISIT CHINA LATE IN 1975
IN A MOVE TO ACCELERATE U.S. RELATIONS WITH THE MAINLAND
AND TO BALANCE SOVIET LEADER LEONID BREZHNEV'S TRIP TO
WASHINGTON NEXT JUNE, A COMMUNIQUE SAID TODAY.

SHANGHAI (UPI) -- HAK ENDED A FIVE-DAY TRIP TO CHINA TODAY,
VIEWING ANCIENT GARDENS, TOURING AN EMBROIDERY FACTORY AND
EATING AT EVERY STOP ALONG THE WAY...AMERICAN OFFICIALS
REFUSED TO COMMENT ON MUCH OF THE TALKS, BUT SAID CHINA AND
THE UNITED STATES AGREED TO SKIRT THE MAJOR ISSUE DIVIDING
THEM -- U.S. RECOGNITION OF THE TAIWAN GOVERNMENT.

UNCLASSIFIED

PAGE 02  STATE  263171

NEWSMEN ASKED A U.S. OFFICIAL IF AMERICA'S TWO-CHINA POLICY
CAME UP DURING KISSINGER'S TALKS WITH PREMIER CHOU EN-LAI,
DEPUTY PREMIER TENG HSIAO-PING AND FOREIGN MINISTER CHOU

KUAN HUA.

&quot;WE'RE NOT PUSHING THAT,&quot; THE OFFICIAL SAID.

IS PEKING, WHICH CITES U.S. RECOGNITION OF TAIWAN AS THE
BAR TOWARD FULL SINO-AMERICAN RELATIONS, PRESSING IT?

&quot;THERE'S NO GREAT PRESSURE,&quot; SAID THE OFFICIAL...

THE SECRETARY SAID THE VISIT COMMITTED BOTH SIDES TO
SEEKING NORMALIZATION OF RELATIONS AND STRENGTHENED
AMERICA'S NEW ERA OF FRIENDSHIP WITH CHINA.

HE SAID THE TRIP GAVE HIM A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF CHINA'S
POINT OF VIEW AND HE PROMISED TO TAKE PEKING'S IDEAS INTO
ACCOUNT IN FORMING U.S. POLICY.

CHIAO, IN RETURN, PRAISED THE TALKS FOR INCREASING MUTUAL
UNDERSTANDING AND IMPROVING SINO-AMERICAN RELATIONS.

AP -- BARRY SCHWEID -- HAK, ON HIS WAY HOME FROM PEKING
WITHOUT SEEING CHAIRMAN MAO, MADE NO MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH
REGARDING TAIWAN DURING THIS TRIP TO THE CHINESE
CAPITAL...

TOKYO (AP) -- HAK ARRIVED IN TOKYO ON HIS WAY HOME FROM
CHINA TODAY.  HE IS TO MEET WITH JAPANESE FOREIGN MINIS-
TER TOSHIO KIMURA ON SATURDAY BEFORE FLYING TO WASHING-
TON.

ON HIS LAST DAY IN CHINA, KISSINGER VISITED THE ANCIENT
GARDEN CITY OF SOOCHOW.  THE CHINESE NEWS AGENCY SAID HE
WAS ACCOMPANIED BY FOREIGN MINISTER CHIAO KUAN-HUA AND HIS
DEPUTY WANG HAI-JUNG.

HSINHUA SAID KISSINGER LEFT CHINA FROM SHANGHAI AND WAS
SEEN OFF BY CHIAO, WANG AND OTHER CHINESE OFFICIALS AND
UNCLASSIFIED

PAGE 03  STATE  263171

GEORGE BUSH, CHIEF OF THE U.S. LIAISON OFFICE IN PEKING.

BEFORE THEIR DEPARTURE FROM HOME,  HSINHUA SAID, THE
AMERICANS WERE HONORED AT AN AIRPORT DINNER BY THE
SHANGHAI MUNICIPAL REVOLUTIONARY COMMITTEE.

TV/RADIO

1.  RICHARD VALERIANI -- NBC-TVTODAY: THIS HUGE COMPLEX
IS THE SOVIET UNION'S DIPLOMATIC COMPOUND IN PEKING.  IT
WAS BUILT BACK IN THE FIFTIES BEFORE THE TWO GIANTS OF
THE COMMUNIST WORLD CAME TO IDEOLOGICAL BLOWS.  FOR

SEVERAL YEARS NOW, CHINA AND THE SOVIET UNION HAVE LOOKED
AT EACH OTHER AS WORST ENEMIES AND DESPITE SOME RECENT
SPECULATION IN THE WESTERN PRESS ABOUT A POSSIBLE RECON-
CILIATION, NON-COMMUNIST DIPLOMATS HERE DO NOT SEE IT
HAPPENING ANYTIME SOON.  IT IS TRUE THAT THE RUSSIANS
AND THE CHINESE HAVE RECENTLY MODERATED THEIR MUTUAL
PROPAGANDA TIRADES; BUT THEY STILL CRITICIZE EACH AND
OTHER AND THEY ARE NOW TRYING TO OUT-PROPAGANDIZE EACH
OTHER BY MAKING PROPOSALS THAT THEY KNOW THE OTHER SIDE
WON'T ACCEPT, RATHER THAN JUST CALLING EACH OTHER NAMES.
IT IS ALSO TRUE THAT THE CHINESE HAVE STOPPED PLAYING UP
THE THREAT OF A RUSSIAN ATTACK, BUT WESTERN ANALYSTS
BELIEVE THAT IS BECAUSE THEY WANT TO REDUCE PRESSURE FROM TH
THE CHINESE MILITARY FOR A BIGGER CHUNK OF THE BUDGET
WHICH SUCH A THREAT WOULD REQUIRE.  SO WHILE THE
DIPLOMATIC ATMOSPHERE BETWEEN PEKING AND MOSCOW MAY HAVE
IMPROVED SOMEWHAT, THE BASIC CONFLICT BETWEEN THEM STILL
SHOWS NO REAL SIGNS THAT IT WILL BE RESOLVED IN THE
FORESEEABLE FUTURE.

2.  MARVIN KALB -- CBS RADIO -- TOKYO:  THE COMMUNIQUE
IS FOUR SENTENCES AND ONLY ONE WORD IN THE SECOND AND ALL
OF THE FOURTH ARE WORTH READING.  THE WORD IS 'FRANK'
SUGGESTING KISSINGER'S FOUR DAYS OF TALKS IN PEKING WENT
TO THE POINT TO SAY THE LEAST AND THE SENTENCE WORTH
READING IS THAT BOTH GOVERNMENTS HAVE AGREED THAT PRES-
IDENT FORD WILL VISIT CHINA IN 1975, THE PRESIDENT VISITED
RUSSIA LAST WEEKEND.  ONE SENIOR AMERICAN OFFICIAL TOLD
UNCLASSIFIED

PAGE 04  STATE  263171

REPORTERS ON THE FLIGHT INTO TOKYO FROM SHANGHAI TONIGHT
THAT THE TRIP WOULD TAKE PLACE AFTER BREZHNEV VISITS THE
U.S. NEXT JUNE; IN OTHER WORDS, IN THE SECOND HALF OF
1975.  IT IS CLEAR FROM THIS EXTRAORDINARILY BRIEF
COMMUNIQUE THAT BOTH SIDES, THE U.S. AND CHINA, COULD NOT
REACH ANY BASIC AGREEMENT ON BI-LATERAL ISSUES BUT THAT
THEY STILL WANTED TO DEMONSTRATE THEIR STRATEGIC
INTEREST IN USING THEIR RELATIONSHIP AS LEVERAGE AGAINST
RUSSIA, THAT IS WHY CHINA WANTS THE PRESIDENT TO VISIT
AND WHY THE PRESIDENT WANTS TO GO.

3.  KALB -- CBS RADIO: WHAT SEEMED TO BE A FACT YESTER-
DAY, IS TODAY.  HAK CAME TO CHINA BUT HE DID NOT GET HIS
MEETING WITH MAO.  THE CHINESE LEADER WHO HAS BEEN
UNUSUALLY AVAILABLE TO FOREIGN VISITORS IN RECENT MONTHS --
HE HAS SEEN EIGHT OF THEM -- DID NOT WANT TO SEE THE
SECRETARY OF STATE, A SIGN OF CHINESE DISPLEASURE WITH
THE PACE AND STYLE OF AMERICAN POLICY.  IT MIGHT ALSO HAVE
BEEN MAO'S WAY OF SAYING HE DID NOT LIKE THE IDEA OF A
SOVIET-AMERICAN SUMMIT TAKING PLACE AT THE DOORSTEP OF
CHINA TAKING PLACE LAST WEEK IN VLADIVOSTOK...

NEWSPAPERS

1.  WASHPOST -- OBERDORFER -- PAGE 20, PHOTO HAK TOASTING
CHIAO: THREE DAYS OF TALKS BETWEEN KISSINGER AND CHINESE
OFFICIALS APPEAR TO HAVE BROUGHT NO PROGRESS TOWARD
AGREEMENT ON THE STICKY QUESTION OF TAIWAN AND NO MAJOR
BREAKTHROUGH IN OTHER ASPECTS OF SINO-AMERICAN RELATIONS
...

PRESENT INDICATIONS ARE THAT KISSINGER WILL NOT BE GIVEN
AN AUDIENCE WITH COMMUNIST PARTY CHAIRMAN MAO TSE-TUNG.

WHILE THE ENTHUSIASM QUOTIENT DISPLAYED BY CHINESE LEADERS
IN THE PRESENCE  OF WESTERN JOURNALISTS WAS NOT VERY HIGH,
NEITHER WAS THERE ANY OPEN SIGN OF CRITICISM OF KISSINGER
OR HIS MISSION.

AS LONG AS THE SOVIETS REMAIN A POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS
ADVERSARY ALONG THE VAST NORTHERN BORDER, CHINA APPEARS
UNCLASSIFIED

PAGE 05  STATE  263171

DETERMINED TO MAINTAIN ITS THREE-YEAR-OLD RELATIONSHIP
WITH THE UNITED STATES.

A SENIOR AMERICAN MAINTAINED TONIGHT THAT THERE IS NO
GREAT PRESSURE FROM THE CHINESE SIDE WITH RESPECT TO THE
TAIWAN QUESTION, WHICH IS THE PRINCIPAL BARRIER TO THE
FULL NORMALIZATION OF SINO-AMERICAN RELATIONS.

IN THIS SITUATION THE UNITED STATES SEES NO REASON TO
PUSH FOR CHANGES REGARDING TAIWAN, THE OFFICIAL ADDED...

2.  NYTIMES -- LELYVELD -- PAGE ONE: KISSINGER TOLD HIS
CHINESE HOSTS TONIGHT THAT HE HAD ACHIEVED &quot;A BETTER
UNDERSTANDING&quot; OF THEIR VIEWPOINT ON HIS VISIT HERE AND
WOULD TAKE IT &quot;SERIOUSLY INTO ACCOUNT IN CONDUCTING OUR
FOREIGN POLICY.&quot;

UNLESS THERE IS A LAST-MINUTE CHANGE IN HIS SCHEDULE,
HE WILL LEAVE CHINA WITHOUT HAVING BEEN GRANTED AN
INTERVIEW WITH MAO TSE-TUNG, CHAIRMAN OF THE CHINESE
COMMUNIST PARTY.

AMERICAN OFFICIALS ARE POINTING OUT THAT A MEETING WITH
CHAIRMAN MAO IS NOT AUTOMATIC SINCE MR. KISSINGER IS NOT
A HEAD OF GOVERNMENT.

CHAIRMAN MAO HAS APPARENTLY NOT BEEN IN PEKING FOR FIVE
MONTHS.  HE IS NOT BELIEVED TO BE SOMEWHERE IN CENTRAL
CHINA, POSSIBLY IN HIS NATIVE HUNAN PROVINCE.

CHINESE OFFICIALS HAVE GONE TO GREAT LENGTHS TO KEEP
HIS PRECISE WHEREABOUTS SECRET, BUT HE CONTINUES TO RECEIVE
FOREIGN LEADERS.

INEVITABLY, IF MR. KISSINGER DOES NOT GET TO SEE MR. MAO
TOMORROW, DIPLOMATIC SPECULATION ABOUT CHINESE DISPLEASURE
WITH WASHINGTON WILL INTENSIFY.

IN HIS TOAST TONIGHT, MR. KISSINGER DECLARED THAT PROGRESS
HAD BEEN ACHIEVED DURING EACH OF HIS SEVEN VISITS HERE.
LATER, AN AMERICAN OFFICIAL INSISTED THAT THERE HAD BEEN
UNCLASSIFIED

PAGE 06  STATE  263171

NO GREAT PRESSURE FROM THE CHINESE SIDE ON THE TAIWAN
ISSUE.

THE OFFICIAL SAID THE UNITED STATES WAS NOT PRESSING FOR
NORMALIZATION AND ASKED WHETHER THERE WAS ANY REASON WHY
IT SHOULD.

THE CHINESE TOAST AT THE BANQUET, GIVEN BY THE NEW
FOREIGN MINISTER, CHIAO KUAN-HUA, SEEMED UNUSUALLY TERSE
AND UNDERSTATED.  UNLIKE MR. KISSINGER'S IT MADE NO
MENTION OF ANY PROGRESS.

A JOINT COMMUNIQUE WILL NOT BE MADE PUBLIC UNTIL THE
DEPARTURE OF MR. KISSINGER.  BUT IT ALREADY SEEMS CLEAR T
THAT NO AGREEMENT HAS BEEN REACHED ON THE LONG-STANDING
QUESTIONS OF CHINESE ASSETS FROZEN IN THE UNITED STATES
AND AMERICAN CLAIMS AGAINST THE CHINESE FOR PROPERTY
SEIZED AFTER THE COMMUNISTS CAME TO POWER IN 1949.

3.  BALTSUN -- TREWHITT -- PAGE ONE, PHOTO HAK AND FM
CHIAO AT TEMPLE OF HEAVEN: KISSINGER, THE SECRETARY
OF STATE, CLOSED FORMAL DISCUSSIONS WITH CHINESE
LEADERS YESTERDAY WITHOUT MAKING VISIBLE PROGRESS TOWARD
CLOSER TI:S BETWEEN THEIR TWO COUNTRIES...

THEY AGREED TO ISSUE A COMMUNIQUE SUMMING UP THEIR
CONVERSATIONS...IT APPEARED UNLIKELY THAT IT WOULD
CONTAIN ANY SURPRISES.

THE ABSENCE    OF ANNOUNCED AGREEMENTS DID NOT MEAN THE
ABSENCE OF SUBSTANCE IN THE DISCUSSIONS, HOWEVER, UNITED
STATES OFFICIALS INDICATED THE TWO GOVERNMENTS WERE
EAR AGREEMENT ON THE RELEASE OF COUNTERPART ASSETS HELD
BY EACH -- $80 MILLION BY THE U.S. AND $200 MILLION BY
CHINA.

&quot;THAT'S MORE A LEGAL AND TECHNICAL PROBLEM FOR THE
UNITED STATES NOW,&quot; ONE SOURCE SAID.

THEIR REVIEW OF BILATERAL AND INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS AT
TIMES WAS BRISK AND BLUNT.
UNCLASSIFIED

PAGE 07  STATE  263171

MR. CHIAO SIGNALED THE NATURE OF THOSE EXCHANGES BY
SAYING THEY WERE CARRIED OUT IN A &quot;CANDID SPIRIT,&quot; A CODE
PHRASE USUALLY MEANING DISAGREEMENT.

ONE CHINESE OFFICIAL WARNED PRIVATELY OF SOVIET BAD FAITH
IN THE PROJECTED STRATEGIC ARMS AGREEMENT ANNOUNCED LAST
WEEK.

A SENIOR AMERICAN OFFICIAL DISCOUNTED THE TAIWAN ISSUE.
&quot;THERE'S NO GREAT PRESSURE FROM THE CHINESE SIDE ON THAT,&quot;
HE SAID, &quot;AND WE'RE NOT PUSHING IT.  WHY SHOULD WE?&quot;

THE UPSHOT WAS THAT THE CHINESE SEEMED LESS PLEASED WITH
THE COURSE OF THE MEETINGS THAN MR. KISSINGER.  THE
DIMMING OUTLOOK FOR A MEETING BETWEEN MR. KISSINGER AND
CHAIRMAN MAO TSE-TUNG, THE CHINESE PATRIARCH, WAS SEEN BY
SOME OUTSIDERS AS ONE FRAGMENT OF EVIDENCE ON THAT SCORE
SINCE THE SECRETARY DID MEET CHAIRMAN MAO WHEN HE WAS
HERE A YEAR AGO.

HOWEVER, CHAIRMAN MAO IS ILL, AND IT WAS NOT CERTAIN
WHETHER HIS HEALTH PERMITTED SUCH MEETINGS...

4.  WASHSTAR -- OSWALD JOHNSTON, P.8: KISSINGER'S
SCHEDULED FORMAL TALKS WITH CHINESE LEADERS ENDED ON THE
SAME NOTE ON WHICH THEY BEGAN: CORRECT, SUBDUED AND BY ALL
OUTWARD SIGNS, INCONCLUSIVE.     -

KISSINGER CONTINUES TO MAKE IT KNOWN THROUGH AIDES THAT HE

BUT ALL THE OBJECTIVE SIGNPOSTS THAT MARKED EARLIER
