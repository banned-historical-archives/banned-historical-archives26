		<h3>Tor</h3>
		<p><a href="https://www.torproject.org">Tor</a> is an encrypted anonymising network that makes it harder to intercept internet communications, or see where communications are coming from or going to.</p>
		<p>In order to use the WikiLeaks public submission system as detailed above you can download the Tor Browser Bundle, which is a Firefox-like browser available for Windows, Mac OS X and GNU/Linux and pre-configured to connect using the anonymising system Tor.</p>
		<h4>Tails</h4>
		<p>If you are at high risk and you have the capacity to do so, you can also access the submission system through a secure operating system called <a href="https://tails.boum.org">Tails</a>. Tails is an operating system launched from a USB stick or a DVD that aim to leaves no traces when the computer is shut down after use and automatically routes your internet traffic through Tor. Tails will require you to have either a USB stick or a DVD at least 4GB big and a laptop or desktop computer.</p>

		<h3>Tips</h3>
		<p>Our submission system works hard to preserve your anonymity, but we recommend you also take some of your own precautions. Please review these basic guidelines. </p>
		<div>
			<h4>1. Contact us if you have specific problems</h4>
			<p>If you have a very large submission, or a submission with a complex format, or are a high-risk source, please <a href="#submit_help_contact">contact us</a>. In our experience it is always possible to find a custom solution for even the most seemingly difficult situations.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h4>2. What computer to use</h4>
			<p>If the computer you are uploading from could subsequently be audited in an investigation, consider using a computer that is not easily tied to you. Technical users can also use <a href="https://tails.boum.org">Tails</a> to help ensure you do not leave any records of your submission on the computer.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h4>3. Do not talk about your submission to others</h4>
			<p>If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in source protection – it is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This includes other media organisations.</p>
		</div>

	</div>
</div>

<div id="submit_help_after" class="submit_elem">

			</div>
		</div>

		<h3>After</h3>

		<div>
			<h4>1. Do not talk about your submission to others</h4>
			<p>If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in source protection – it is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This includes other media organisations.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h4>2. Act normal</h4>
			<p>If you are a high-risk source, avoid saying anything or doing anything after submitting which might promote suspicion. In particular, you should try to stick to your normal routine and behaviour.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h4>3. Remove traces of your submission</h4>
			<p>If you are a high-risk source and the computer you prepared your submission on, or uploaded it from, could subsequently be audited in an investigation, we recommend that you format and dispose of the computer hard drive and any other storage media you used.</p>
			<p>In particular, hard drives retain data after formatting which may be visible to a digital forensics team and flash media (USB sticks, memory cards and SSD drives) retain data even after a secure erasure. If you used flash media to store sensitive data, it is important to destroy the media.</p>
			<p>If you do this and are a high-risk source you should make sure there are no traces of the clean-up, since such traces themselves may draw suspicion.</p>
			<div>
				<h4>4. If you face legal action</h4>
				<p>If a legal action is brought against you as a result of your submission, there are organisations that may help you. The Courage Foundation is an international organisation dedicated to the protection of journalistic sources. You can find more details at <a href="https://www.couragefound.org">https://www.couragefound.org</a>.</p>

		<p>WikiLeaks publishes documents of political or historical importance that are censored or otherwise suppressed. We specialise in strategic global publishing and large archives.</p>
		<p>The following is the address of our secure site where you can anonymously upload your documents to WikiLeaks editors. You can only access this submissions system through Tor. (See our <a href="#submit_help_tor">Tor tab</a> for more information.) We also advise you to read our <a href="#submit_help_tips">tips for sources</a> before submitting.</p>

The emails show  Stratfor's web of informers, pay-off structure, payment laundering techniques and psychological methods.</p>

   Waziristan Agency<br />
<br />
   o   Unnamed official: &quot;Such a moral turpitude of disgracing our holy book<br />
   cannot be expected from a Muslim,&quot;<br />
<br />
   o   IGP [inspector general of police] KP [Khyber Pakhtunkhwa] has directed<br />
   police officials to beware of toy bombs and not accept any parcel<br />

<br />
   o   &quot;They'll be the first to say that there are limits to how much they<br />
   can do&quot;<br />

   we've literally seen the movie before, it's called 'Charlie Wilson's War'<br />
   and indeed that is not in my view a good optiona**<br />
<br />
   o   &quot;However difficult the relationship maybe it's one we need to continue<br />
   to work, it's one where we need to recognize what our Pakistani partners<br />
   have done, they've sacrificed several thousand soldiers and police and<br />

   the extent of the terrorist threat within Australia,&quot; McClelland said in a<br />

   o   &quot;And I am advised it has not been accompanied by any specific threat<br />
   in Australia or to Australian citizens&quot;<br />

   this material will emerge on overseas sites&quot;<br />

   o   New South Wales assistant police commissioner Peter Dein, the state's<br />
   counter-terrorism commander: &quot;When you actually read it you see that most<br />
   of it touches on the death of Osama bin Laden, but then you get to the<br />
   back of the magazine and you find that there's a photograph of the Opera<br />
   House,&quot;<br />
<br />
   o   &quot;I must stress that there's no text, no commentary that exists (in the<br />
   magazine) that relates to the Opera House at all.&quot;<br />
<br />
   o   &quot;It could simply be the fact that it's an icon that is well known<br />
   around the Western world and may not really have any relevance that it is<br />
   in Sydney,&quot;<br />
<br />
   o   &quot;There's no information whatsoever to tell us that there is an attack<br />
   planneda**<br />
<br />

   magazine can have on vulnerable people in our community who are likely to<br />
   be influenced by this extremist rhetorica**<br />

   Syrian army steps up Homs campaign<br />

<br />
   BEIRUT, July 21 (Reuters) - The Syrian army stepped up its military<br />
   operation in the central city of Homs which has become a focal point for<br />
   pro-democracy protests, activists and residents said on Thursday.<br />
<br />
   Shooting and explosions were heard in the old district of Bab Sbaa,<br />
   residents said.<br />
<br />
   &quot;There are casualties and many people have been arrested. We are very<br />
   scared,&quot; a resident in Homs, who asked to be referred to only by his first<br />
   name, Ahmed.<br />
<br />
   A resident in another neighbourhood said local hospitals were calling for<br />
   blood donations after they received wounded people from Bab Sbaa.<br />
<br />
   &quot;There is heavy military deployment in Homs; military checkpoints are<br />
   everywhere in the city. There is heavy shooting in Bab Sbaa, one house was<br />
   burned and the humanitarian conditions are dire,&quot; the Syrian Observatory<br />
   for Human Rights said in a statement.<br />
<br />
   An activist in Homs said the army had raided houses in Bab Sbaa. A<br />
   resident in the city told Reuters by phone that the army fired at<br />
   worshippers in eastern Khalidiya district as they left Khaled Ibn al-Walid<br />
   mosque in the early hours of the morning.<br />
<br />
   It is hard to verify witness accounts as Syrian authorities have expelled<br />
   most international media organisations.<br />
<br />
   Homs has been a centre of the protests against President Bashar al-Assad's<br />
   11-year rule and in support of political freedoms.<br />
<br />
   Tensions have run high between the majority Sunni inhabitants and members<br />
   of the Alawite minority, the same sect as Assad, creating fears that a<br />
   peaceful pro-democracy movement could take a dangerous turn towards a<br />
   sectarian conflict.<br />
<br />
   The return of the mutilated bodies of three Alawite men to their relatives<br />
   had led to fighting between armed residents in Homs this week, the<br />
   Observatory said on Monday.<br />
<br />
   The total death toll in Homs since the weekend has risen to at least 33,<br />
   activists and residents said. It is difficult to verify whether people<br />
   were killed by government forces or feuding residents.<br />
<br />
   Human rights organisations say at least 1,400 civilians have been killed<br />
   since the protests against Assad erupted in March.<br />
<br />
   Syrian authorities blame armed groups with Islamist links for violence<br />
   across the country and say at least 500 policemen and soldiers have been<br />
   killed since March.<br />
<br />
   Assad has responded to protests with a mixture of force and promises of<br />
   reforms. He sent his troops and tanks to numerous cities and towns to<br />
   crush protests, and thousands have been arrested.<br />
<br />
   But Assad has also granted citizenship to tens of thousands of Kurds,<br />
   lifted the draconian state of emergency, freed hundreds of prisoners and<br />
   called for a national dialogue.<br />
<br />
   Troops and tanks first entered Homs, 165 km (100 miles) north of Damascus,<br />
   two months ago and occupied the main square after large protests demanding<br />
   political freedoms. (Editing by Robert Woodward) (Editted by Mariam<br />

        Yemeni military claims 2 senior AQAP commanders killed in south<br />
<br />
   By Bill Roggio, July 21, 2011 6:07 AM<br />
<br />
    <br />
<br />
   http://www.longwarjournal.org/threat-matrix/archives/2011/07/yemeni_military_claims_2_senio.php<br />
<br />
   Saba Net and Almotamar, two media outlets that are operated by the Yemeni<br />
   government, are claiming that Yemeni troops have killed a top al Qaeda in<br />
   the Arabian Peninsula leaders. The two leaders are said to have been<br />
   killed during fighting in Abyan (presumably in Zinjibar, the provincial<br />
   capital that is under AQAP control):<br />
<br />
   Two leaders of al-Qaeda have been killed in Abyan province, a security<br />
   source in the province said on Wednesday.<br />
<br />
   The two terrorists were Aidh al Shabwani and Awadh Mohammed Saleh al<br />
   Shabwani, who have been killed among many other terrorists in the clashes<br />
   between the armed forces and the terrorist organization currently taking<br />
   place in Abyan, the source said.<br />
<br />
   The source said that the military forces have managed to arrest &quot;Abdul<br />
   Rahman Mohammed Dawa'n&quot;, one of al-Qaeda members, who is wanted besides<br />
   others for killing ten soldiers in an ambush in Mukairas, Abyan, on June<br />
   6.<br />
<br />
   &quot;The military forces are keeping on hunting the terrorists of al-Qaeda&quot;,<br />
   the source said, adding that dozens of them have been killed and many<br />
   others wounded during the combing operations.<br />
<br />
   Aidh al Shabwani has previously been described as the leader of AQAP<br />
   forces in Marib province.<br />
<br />
   Like reports from Pakistani officials, reports from Yemeni officials<br />
   should be taken with a grain of salt. Over the past several years, Yemeni<br />
   officials have had a terrible track record with their reports of slain<br />
   AQAP leader. Top AQAP leaders Nasir al Wuhayshi, Said al Shihri, Qasim al<br />
   Raymi, Anwar al Awalki, and others have been reported killed in various<br />
   Yemeni operations and US airstrikes. The reports have since turned out to<br />
   be false.<br />
<br />
   Aidh al Shabwani was also the subject of a false death report. He was<br />
   reported to have been killed in a Jan. 15, 2010 strike that was also<br />
   supposed to have killed Qasim al Raymi and Ammar Abadah Nasser al Wa'eli.<br />
   All three men men were later confirmed to be alive.<br />
<br />
   With that said, Yemeni officials were correct on the recent reports of the<br />
   death of three AQAP commanders. On June 9, officials told Almotamar that<br />
   Waeli, Ali Abdullah Naji al Harithi, and Ali Saleh Farhan were killed<br />
   while fighting Yemeni troops in Zinjibar. The New York Times. meanwhile,<br />
   claimed Harithi was killed in a US airstrike.<br />
<br />
   AQAP confirmed that the three men were indeed killed in Zinjibar when it<br />
   released martyrdom statements for the three terrorists in its latest<br />
   edition of Inspire. AQAP said Harithi and Waeli were killed in a US<br />
   airstrike, while Farhan was killed while fighting Yemeni troops.<br />

                 U.S. Missiles Missed Awlaki By Inches In Yemen<br />
<br />
   http://abcnews.go.com/Blotter/us-missed-awlaki-inches-yemen/story?id=14108686<br />
<br />
    <br />
<br />
   7.19.11<br />
<br />
    <br />
<br />
   Just days after the Navy SEAL raid that killed Osama bin Laden, the U.S.<br />
   came within inches of taking out the next big target on their terror hit<br />
   list, the man considered the biggest threat to America.<br />
<br />
   It was a tip from the Yemeni government that sent U.S. aircraft over the<br />
   wilds of southern Yemen's Shabwa province in search of Anwar al-Awlaki,<br />
   the U.S.-born radical Islamic cleric and al Qaeda leader who has been<br />
   linked to several deadly plots against America.<br />
<br />
   ABC News has learned that on May 5, the U.S. military dispatched a<br />
   fearsome array of heavily armed warplanes including Marine Harrier jets,<br />
   predator drones and a special operations aircraft carrying short range<br />
   Griffin missiles to follow a pickup truck in which Awlaki was a passenger.<br />
<br />
   But unlike the successful mission that eliminated bin Laden, this raid<br />
   would be marred by what an official described to ABC News as a series of<br />
   &quot;errors.&quot; Crews tracking Awlaki were unable to keep the laser from the<br />
   targeting pod, which guides missiles into their targets, locked on the<br />
   moving truck. The first missile came, launched from the special operations<br />
   aircraft, missed.<br />
<br />
   The miss gave Awlaki time to call additional al Qaeda operatives for help.<br />
   More vehicles descended on the area to confuse those tracking him.<br />
<br />
   With Harriers and a predator drone still overhead, the U.S. fired another<br />
   missile at Awlaki. This time a huge fireball engulfed the pickup truck.<br />
   The U.S. military trackers thought they had their man.<br />
<br />
   But then they watched, stunned, as the truck drove straight out of the<br />
   fireball to safety. The missile had only grazed the back bumper.<br />
<br />
   The Harriers, which were almost out of gas, had to leave. The remaining<br />
   aircraft tried to keep following Awlaki to take another shot. But then<br />
   cloud cover got in the way. Awlaki was able to exploit a moment of<br />
   hesitation while the targeting pods and the surveillance aircraft were<br />
   refocusing to jump out of his pickup truck and move to another.<br />
<br />
   When the U.S. did finally manage to hit the original truck with missiles,<br />
   killing the men inside, Awlaki was not one of them. Two operatives died,<br />
   but Awlaki got away. There has been no sign of him since.<br />
<br />
   In early 2010, the Obama administration authorized the CIA and the U.S.<br />
   military to kill Awlaki even though he is a U.S. citizen. Born in New<br />
   Mexico, Awlaki moved to Yemen in 2004. Times Square bomber Faisal Shahzad<br />
   said he was inspired by Awlaki, and accused Ft. Hood shooter Maj. Nidal<br />
   Hasan exchanged emails with Awlaki. In January 2010, Awlaki said he had<br />
   had contact with Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, the would-be &quot;underwear<br />
   bomber&quot; accused of trying to blow up Northwest flight 253 from Amsterdam<br />
   to Detroit on Christmas Day 2009.<br />

   Nigerian president meets elders over Islamist sect attacks<br />
<br />
   http://www.africasia.com/services/news/newsitem.php?area=africa&amp;item=110720224105.6umbo4ru.php<br />
<br />
   7.20.11<br />
<br />
   Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan met Wednesday with northern elders on<br />
   the menace of Islamist sect Boko Haram, blamed for a spate of deadly bomb<br />
   and gun attacks especially in the city of Maiduguri.<br />
<br />
   &quot;The president this afternoon held a broad-based consultation with leaders<br />
   from Borno State, the North East and Arewa Consultative Forum on the<br />
   security situation in Borno state and other parts of the north,&quot;<br />
   Information Minister Labaran Maku said.<br />
<br />
   The meeting explored different options to bring about peace and security<br />
   in the beleaguered state and other affected areas in northern Nigeria,<br />
   said the minister who briefed journalists after the meeting.<br />
<br />
   He did not give details.<br />
<br />
   The meeting, which he said was &quot;very fruitful&quot;, focused on finding a<br />
   lasting solution to the Boko Haram crisis, he said.<br />
<br />
   &quot;All hands have to be on deck, political leaders, community leaders,<br />
   traditional leaders, religious leaders so that together, we can look at<br />
   ways to bring about solution,&quot; said Maku.<br />
<br />
   The minister said that it would be &quot;premature&quot; to withdraw troops Jonathan<br />
   sent to Maiduguri last month to restore order in the troubled city.<br />
<br />
   Some residents of the city, politicians and political leaders have<br />
   recently called for the withdrawal of the troops, which they, along with<br />
   Amnesty International, accused of human rights violations such as<br />
   extra-judicial killings, rape and burning of houses.<br />
<br />
   Amnesty said 25 people were killed during a recent military raid.<br />
<br />
   It called for a probe into the killings.<br />
<br />
   The Joint Task Force (JTF) has denied the charges.<br />
<br />
   &quot;There were broad based consultations about the outcry for the withdrawal<br />
   of military. But in the light of this discussion, the meeting generally<br />
   agreed that it is premature to withdraw the military,&quot; the minister said.<br />
<br />
   &quot;What was needed was that if there are cases of individual misbehaviour by<br />
   members of the JTF, the authorities will look into those cases,&quot; he said,<br />
   adding that one or two soldiers who acted &quot;in excess&quot; were being<br />
   questioned.<br />
<br />
   Authorities in the state at the weekend urged sect members to accept a<br />
   ceasefire and embrace dialogue with government.<br />
<br />
   The sect has in recent weeks stepped up bomb and drive-by shooting attacks<br />
   in the state capital Maiduguri which have claimed scores of lives.<br />
<br />
   Thousands of residents have fled the city in recent days over violence and<br />
   alleged rights violations by soldiers.<br />
<br />
   The sect has concentrated the attacks in Maiduguri where the military<br />
   onslaught against the sect took place.<br />

Yemen Republican Guards kill protester in Taez: Medics<br />
<br />
   THURSDAY, 21 JULY 2011 16:50 MOHIDEEN MIFTHAH<br />

   http://www.sundaytimes.lk/index.php/world-news/9105-yemen-republican-guards-kill-protester-in-taez-medics<br />
<br />
   SANAA, July 21, 2011 (AFP) - Yemeni Republican Guards shot dead one<br />
   protester and wounded three in the second-largest city of Taez on<br />
   Thursday, medics said.<br />
   The Guards opened fire as thousands of people protested against the regime<br />
   of President Ali Abdullah Saleh in central Taez, a flashpoint city south<br />
   of the capital Sanaa, according to organisers.<br />
   It is the first time a protester has been killed in weeks in Taez, one of<br />
   the first cities to rise up against Saleh's rule.<br />
   Protesters said on May 30 that forces loyal to Saleh had killed 21<br />
   protesters as they crushed a four-month-old sit-in in Taez.<br />
   The UN human rights office said the next day that more than 50 people had<br />
   been killed since May 29 by pro-regime forces in Taez.<br />
   Tribesmen who said their aim is to protect protesters have since June<br />
   battled security forces loyal to Saleh in Taez.<br />
   Seven civilians were killed and 30 wounded in Republican Guards shelling<br />
   in Taez on July 15, a security official said, while three security<br />
   personnel were killed in an ambush by opposition tribesmen.<br />
   Tribal sources and witnesses said that four tribesmen and three civilians<br />
   were wounded in the ambush.<br />
   Yemeni protesters have since January been calling for Saleh, who has been<br />
   in power since 1978, to quit office.<br />
   He has been receiving treatment in Saudi Arabia since early June for<br />
   wounds sustained in a blast at his palace, but Deputy Information Minister<br />
   Abdo al-Janadi said on Saturday that Saleh will return home from Saudi<br />
   Arabia a**soon.a**<br />

PARIS, July 21 (KUNA) - The French government on Thursday condemned a decision by        <br />
Palestinian group Hamas to refuse to reopen the youth non-governmental organisation,     <br />
Sharek Forum, and the subsequent dissolution of the NGO.                                 <br />
A statement from the French Foreign Ministry said it was &quot;regrettable that the           <br />
population of Gaza is deprived of the means to realise its aspiration&quot; and is denied     <br />
&quot;freedom of expression and of meetings&quot; in this period of the &quot;Arab Spring.&quot; &quot;France     <br />
joins the United Nations in calling on Hamas to go back on its decision of July 12 to    <br />
dissolve Sharek Forum for youth, whose offices have been closed since December 2010,&quot; a  <br />
statement here said, expressing continued support for the people of Gaza.                <br />
Separately, France also condemned the rocket attacks earlier this week against Israel,   <br />
which it said were targeted at civilians. The attacks caused no casualties.              <br />
But the French statement did not condemn the Israeli air attacks in Gaza after the       <br />
rocket firing, air attacks which killed Palestinians.                                    <br />
&quot;France condemns the recent firing of rockets which targeted civilians in the south of   <br />
Israel,&quot; spokesman Roman Nadal said.                                                     <br />
&quot;We call for an immediate halt to this violence and for responsible action in avoiding   <br />
an escalation of violence around Gaza,&quot; he stated.                                       <br />
&quot;These tensions remind us, as if there were need, of the urgency of arriving at a        <br />
negotiated settlement to the conflict,&quot; Nadal affirmed. (End) jk.ajs KUNA 211424 Jul     <br />

<br />
   The FARC are suspected to be involved with a highway attack and bombing in<br />
   the Cauca department during Colombia's Independence Day, reported weekly<br />
   magazine Semana.<br />
<br />
   Eight alleged FARC guerrillas ambushed police traveling on the<br />
   Pan-American highway between the towns of Popayan and Pasto in the Cauca<br />
   department.<br />
<br />
   Three officers were killed in the attack, and several others were wounded.<br />
   According to Semana, the wounded officers have been flown to Popayan to<br />
   receive medical treatment.<br />
<br />
   A bomb was detonated in a local shop in the town of Santander de Quichao,<br />
   also in the Cauca department, at 5AM. The explosion did not produce any<br />
   casualties, but it did damage several nearby houses.<br />
<br />
   It has been speculated that the bomb attack was intended as a punitive act<br />
   for failure to pay extortion money to the FARC.<br />

Hackers reveal personal data of Colombian police officials<br />
<br />

<br />
   http://colombiareports.com/colombia-news/news/17779-hackers-reveal-personal-data-and-spam-colombian-police-officials.html<br />
<br />
   Hackers announced Wednesday they had sent spam bombs to some 250 officials<br />
   of Colombia's national Police and revealed personal data of employees of<br />
   the National Police inviting the public to harass the officials.<br />
<br />
   In a statement published online, the hackers thanked the National Police<br />
   &quot;for keeping us submitted and trampled.&quot;<br />
<br />
   In the same statement, the group &quot;Colombian Hackers&quot; released personal<br />
   information on hundreds of police officials, some with home addresses and<br />
   identification numbers.<br />
<br />
   The announcement followed a day of hacker attacks in which the<br />
   group &quot;Anonymous&quot; was able to shut down the website of Colombia's Ministry<br />

   There has been furious reaction after the Turkish Prime Minister Tayipp<br />
   Erdogan suggested that the Cyprus economy is destined to follow that of<br />
   Greece.<br />
<br />
   Mr Erdogan was speaking at an event in Famagusta last night, where he<br />
   noted that his remarks may a**upset and cause anger amongst Greek<br />
   Cypriots.a**<br />
<br />
   Erdogan went on to praise the Turkish Cypriot administration claiming that<br />
   the a**civil servicea** had achieved remarkable feats in the area of<br />
   public finances, unlike many EU states, which has said had been<br />
   a**economically downgradeda**.<br />
<br />
   Meanwhile the aftershocks of the Turkish Cypriot Police violence against<br />
   protestors during the Erdogana**s arrival to the island continues to<br />
   receive wide coverage in the northern Cyprus press today.<br />
<br />
   YenidA 1/4zen writes: a**Police attacked the protestors without any<br />
   reason,a** where as Afrika insists that the person who is the main<br />
   responsible for the police violence is the new Nicosia a**police Chiefa**<br />
   Erdal Emanet, the man who is suspected of killing Greek Cypriot Solomos<br />
   Solomou at Dherinya in 1996.<br />

                   Robbery rates in Chile hit four-year high<br />

<br />
   Experts suggest PiA+-era administration take action against high<br />
   re-victimization rates.<br />
<br />
   The governmenta**s success in combating crime its first year in office may<br />
   have been a temporary victory, according to a recent crime survey that<br />
   found Chilea**s home robbery rate in 2011 rose for the first time in four<br />
   years.<br />
<br />
    <br />
<br />
   The survey, released Tuesday by Chilean polling firm Adimark and criminal<br />
   justice NGO FundaciA^3n Paz Ciudadana, found that of the 4,040 households<br />
   surveyed between April and June 2011, 37.9 percenta**or two out of every<br />
   fivea**had been a victim of a robbery or attempted robbery in the last six<br />
   months. This represents an overall increase of five percentage points<br />
   since last year. <br />
<br />
   The increase in robbery was primarily focused on Chilea**s lower and<br />
   middle-class communities, where the robbery rate rose from 29.4 to 35.5<br />
   percent and 33.3 to 39.3 percent, respectively. For upper class areas the<br />
   number of robberies increased less substantially, rising from 35.3 to 37.2<br />
   percent.<br />
<br />
   One of the most startling issues determined through the survey was the<br />
   high rate of re-victimization in robbery cases. <br />
<br />
   A vast majority, or 87.8 percent, of the reported robberies were<br />
   concentrated in only 24.9 percent of the households polleda**meaning that<br />
   the same victims were often targeted more than once. <br />
<br />
   a**I can predict that if a family has been the victim of a crime, probably<br />
   within the next six months they will be again,a** Dep. Felipe Harboe, of<br />
   the Partido por la Democracia (PPD), told La Tercera. This statistic,<br />
   Harboe said, a**is very serious.a** <br />
<br />
   The survey results come three months after President Sebastian<br />
   PiA+-eraa**s administration a**citing national polls that suggested rates<br />
   of home robberies dropped by 15.9 percent in 2010a**deemed the<br />
   governmenta**s crime-prevention efforts a success. <br />
<br />
   Government officials acknowledged that the results of the 2011 poll were<br />
   disappointing. But they said one poll does not define success or failure. <br />
<br />
   a**Just as no one survey can deem a government successful, neither can one<br />
   survey defeat a government in its commitment to provide better<br />
   security,a** Interior Minister Rodrigo Hinzpeter told La Tercera. <br />
<br />
   Others suggested, however, that the survey does in fact indicate pitfalls<br />
   in the governmenta**s crime prevention efforts and should concern<br />
   officials. <br />
<br />
   According to Adimark Director Roberto MA(c)ndez, crime prevention was an<br />
   issue at the forefront of PiA+-eraa**s 2009 presidential campaign and was<br />
   declared a priority for Hinzpeter. <br />
<br />
   Though there was one positive findinga**the rate of unreported crimes<br />
   decreased, meaning citizens are taking greater initiative to contact<br />
   authoritiesa**overall, MA(c)ndez suggested, the results do not bode well<br />
   for the governmenta**s approval rating.<br />
<br />
   a**I imagine that [the government] will pay attention to this and other<br />
   surveys to figure out the best ways to achieve their goals,a** MA(c)ndez<br />
   told Radio Universidad de Chile. <br />
<br />
   The surveya**s findings regarding satisfaction with the local police and<br />
   District Attorneya**s Office seem to confirm this opinion. <br />
<br />
   Of the households polled, 37.1 percent said they were dissatisfied with<br />
   efforts by Chilea**s Carabinero police force and Investigative Police<br />
   (PDI) and 57.3 percent indicated they were disappointed with measures<br />
   taken by the DA. <br />
<br />
   The data indicate that current government policies need to be revised, Paz<br />
   Ciudadana Executive Director Javiera Blanco told La Tercera. Blanco is not<br />
   alone in encouraging action. <br />
<br />
   a**We have made many attempts to halt the upward trend of crime and the<br />
   corresponding fear among citizens and these efforts not succeeding,a**<br />
   Ximena Tocornal, sociology professor at the Universidad de Chile told<br />
   Radio Universidad de Chile. With all the money Chile has invested,<br />
   Tocornal indicated, crime rates a**should have gone down significantly.a**<br />

   that the money they received for sexual services was taken from them and<br />
   that their families in Hungary had been threatened.<br />

   neighbours, which makes it easier for him to know any issues of concern<br />
   they have,&quot; he said. <br />
<br />
   He will know his neighbours well, and residents of his area will be<br />
   informed about his presence so they can contact him when they need to, and<br />
   the resident policeman will not have set working hours, Lt Gen Dahi<br />
   added. <br />

                  Kabardian Activist Beaten In Southern Russia<br />

<br />
   NALCHIK, Russia -- The head of a nongovernmental organization in the<br />
   Russian republic of Kabardino-Balkaria was severely beaten by unknown<br />
   assailants in the capital, Nalchik, RFE/RL's Russian and North Caucasus<br />
   services report.<br />
<br />
   Zamir Shukhov, deputy chairman of the NGO Khase, told RFE/RL that five<br />
   assailants attacked Ibragim Yaganov with metal bars and pipes when he and<br />
   his wife were returning home on July 19.<br />
<br />
   Yaganov was hospitalized with a concussion, head injuries, and numerous<br />
   other wounds.<br />
<br />
   Shukhov told RFE/RL the attack on Yaganov was probably connected with his<br />
   social and political activities.<br />
<br />
   &quot;We were planning to hold a roundtable with the participation of activists<br />
   and leaders of the [Kabardino-Balkaria] republic's Kabardian, Balkar,<br />
   Russian, and Cossack ethnic groups to discuss social issues,&quot; he said. &quot;It<br />
   is very early to draw any conclusions at this point, but the attackers<br />
   seem to be professionals.&quot;<br />
<br />
   Yaganov, an ethnic Kabardian himself, has repeatedly criticized the<br />
   republic's predominantly Kabardian leadership. He was subjected to a<br />
   similar attack in December 2009, the perpetrators of which were never<br />
   found.<br />
<br />
   A Nalchik-based human rights center has addressed an open letter to the<br />
   republic's prosecutor-general urging him to take the investigation of the<br />
   attack under his personal control and inform the public of its findings.<br />

   Bomb kills two Pakistan oil workers<br />
<br />
   (AFP) a** 43 minutes ago<br />

<br />
   QUETTA, Pakistan a** A bomb attack on Thursday killed at least two<br />
   Pakistani oil workers in a remote town in the country's troubled southwest<br />
   that borders Afghanistan and Iran, police and doctors said.<br />
<br />
   The blast hit a convoy of Pakistan's government-run Oil and Gas<br />
   Development Company (OGDCL) in the mineral rich province of Baluchistan,<br />
   where rebels are fighting for autonomy and demanding a greater share of<br />
   natural resources.<br />
<br />
   &quot;We received two dead bodies and seven injured from the blast site,&quot;<br />
   Siddiq Ahmed, a doctor told AFP by telephone from the local district<br />
   hospital in the town of Jafarabad, where the attack took place.<br />
<br />
   Police said the bomb was fixed to a motorbike and parked on the roadside<br />
   about 170 miles (272 kilometres) southeast of the provincial capital<br />
   Quetta.<br />
<br />
   &quot;It was a remote-controlled device which hit the oil and gas officials'<br />
   vehicle,&quot; Mohammed Tariq, a senior police official, told AFP.<br />
<br />
   Baluchistan is riven by Islamist militancy, sectarian violence between<br />
   majority Sunnis and minority Shiite Muslims and a separatist insurgency.<br />
<br />
   Baluch rebels rose up in 2004 demanding political autonomy and a greater<br />
   share of profits from the region's wealth of natural resources. Hundreds<br />
   of people have since died.<br />
<br />
   Separately a suicide bomber blew himself up in front of a vehicle of a<br />
   military contractor in Kotkai village of the troubled South Waziristan<br />
   tribal district bordering Afghanistan on Thursday, security officials<br />
   said.<br />

   China tells Tibet monks to 'break with separatists'<br />
   AFP a** 12 hrs ago...<br />
<br />
   http://news.yahoo.com/china-tells-tibet-monks-break-separatists-171505509.html<br />
<br />
   The man widely expected to be China's next president on Wednesday urged<br />
   monks in Tibet to &quot;break with separatist forces&quot; during a visit marking 60<br />
   years since China took control of the restive region.<br />
    <br />
   Speaking at Jokhang temple in the Tibetan capital Lhasa -- the temple<br />
   where Buddhist monks staged a protest in front of foreign reporters in<br />
   2008 -- Vice President Xi Jinping urged over 100 monks to &quot;stay in line<br />
   with the Party&quot;.<br />
    <br />
   Xi spoke days after the Dalai Lama, Tibet's exiled spiritual leader,<br />
   concluded a visit to the United States during which he was warmly welcomed<br />
   by President Barack Obama, angering China, which labels the monk a<br />
   &quot;separatist&quot;.<br />
    <br />
   &quot;The (Communist) Party and the government will not forget your positive<br />
   contributions,&quot; Xi, likely to take over as president by 2013, was quoted<br />
   by the official Xinhua news agency as saying.<br />
    <br />
   He urged the monks to &quot;make a clean break with separatist forces&quot;.<br />
    <br />
   Xi on Tuesday addressed an audience of thousands on the central square of<br />
   Lhasa, in which he vowed to crush any threats to stability in Tibet.<br />
    <br />
   Fresh from victory in the Chinese civil war, the People's Liberation Army<br />
   of Communist leader Mao Zedong marched into Tibet in 1950 and annexed the<br />
   region, an arrangement formalised the following year.<br />
    <br />
   But many Tibetans bridle at Chinese control and that resentment burst out<br />
   in March 2008 with deadly rioting in Lhasa that spread across the region<br />
   and spilled over into neighbouring provinces with Tibetan populations.<br />
    <br />
   A couple of weeks after the violence a group of monks at the Jokhang<br />
   temple staged a brief protest in front of visiting foreign reporters,<br />
   expressing support for the Dalai Lama.<br />
    <br />
   The monks shouted down a Chinese official who was briefing the journalists<br />
   on the recent unrest, and said: &quot;We want the Dalai Lama to return to<br />
   Tibet, we want to be free,&quot; one of the journalists told AFP at the time.<br />
    <br />
   The Jokhang temple, regarded as one of the most sacred sites for Tibetan<br />
   Buddhists, is located in the heart of the old quarter of the city.<br />
    <br />
   The Tibetan quarter was the scene of some of the worst violence during a<br />
   day of rioting on March 14, 2008, which followed four days of protests to<br />
   mark the anniversary of a failed 1959 uprising against Chinese rule.<br />
    <br />
   Overseas Tibetan rights groups have said China, in the run-up to the 60th<br />
   anniversary celebrations this year, has cranked up security measures in<br />
   Tibet even beyond a tight military crackdown imposed after the 2008 unrest<br />
   and which remains in place.<br />

   Concern as Sydney Opera House appears on jihad site<br />
   AFP a**<br />
   http://news.yahoo.com/concern-sydney-opera-house-features-jihad-032813298.html<br />
<br />
   Attorney-General Robert McClelland said Thursday Australia's terror threat<br />
   level would not change despite an image of Sydney's iconic Opera House<br />
   appearing in an online magazine linked to Al-Qaeda.<br />
    <br />
   The landmark building is featured in the latest edition of &quot;Inspire&quot;, an<br />
   English-language site that deals with bomb-making and terrorism.<br />
    <br />
   It is reportedly put together by associates of Al-Qaeda in the Arabian<br />
   Peninsula, a militant Islamist organisation primarily active in Yemen and<br />
   Saudi Arabia.<br />
    <br />
   &quot;I have been advised this publication does not represent any change to the<br />
   extent of the terrorist threat within Australia,&quot; McClelland said in a<br />
   statement.<br />
    <br />
   &quot;And I am advised it has not been accompanied by any specific threat in<br />
   Australia or to Australian citizens.&quot;<br />
    <br />
   The picture of the Opera House was on the front of the online magazine's<br />
   regular bomb-making section, &quot;Open Source Jihad&quot;.<br />
    <br />
   The site first appeared in May last year and reports said that until this<br />
   issue, it had only ever featured images of American cities.<br />
    <br />
   McClelland said the government was writing to the Australian<br />
   Communications and Media Authority to take down links to the magazine but<br />
   acknowledged that removing all access would be difficult.<br />
    <br />
   &quot;In the modern age of global electronic communications, the reality is<br />
   this material will emerge on overseas sites,&quot; he said.<br />
    <br />
   New South Wales assistant police commissioner Peter Dein, the state's<br />
   counter-terrorism commander, said authorities became aware of the Opera<br />
   House picture on Tuesday.<br />
    <br />
   &quot;When you actually read it you see that most of it touches on the death of<br />
   Osama bin Laden, but then you get to the back of the magazine and you find<br />
   that there's a photograph of the Opera House,&quot; he said.<br />
    <br />
   &quot;I must stress that there's no text, no commentary that exists (in the<br />
   magazine) that relates to the Opera House at all.&quot;<br />
    <br />
   He added that it was hard to interpret what message it might be sending.<br />
    <br />
   &quot;It could simply be the fact that it's an icon that is well known around<br />
   the Western world and may not really have any relevance that it is in<br />
   Sydney,&quot; he said.<br />
    <br />
   &quot;There's no information whatsoever to tell us that there is an attack<br />
   planned.<br />
    <br />
   &quot;What we are concerned about is the influences this particular magazine<br />
   can have on vulnerable people in our community who are likely to be<br />
   influenced by this extremist rhetoric.&quot;<br />
    <br />
   He told reporters it was well publicised that there were about 100 people<br />
   in Australia affiliated with terrorists.<br />

<br />
   PARIS: US General David Petraeus admitted there was no option but to work<br />
   on troubled relations with Pakistan, days after standing down from his job<br />
   at the helm of coalition forces in Afghanistan.<br />
    <br />
   Speaking in Paris on his way to his new job as CIA chief, the most<br />
   celebrated military leader of his generation said Afghanistan's neighbor<br />
   wanted to eliminate Al-Qaeda and Taliban militants but was struggling.<br />
    <br />
   &quot;They'll be the first to say that there are limits to how much they can<br />
   do,&quot; said the man who headed the United States' longest-running war for<br />
   the last year, with less territory controlled by militants today but<br />
   civilian deaths up.<br />
    <br />
   Petraeus said Pakistani anti-militant operations have been impressive but<br />
   they &quot;clearly need further effort to deal with some of the other elements,<br />
   like the Qaeda network in North Waziristan and the Taliban in<br />
   Balochistan&quot;.<br />
    <br />
   &quot;This relationship is in a difficult stage,&quot; Petraeus said, blaming<br />
   WikiLeaks revelations, the arrest of CIA agent Raymond Davis as well as<br />
   the killing by US forces of Al-Qaeda kingpin Osama Bin Laden in Pakistan<br />
   in May.<br />
    <br />
   He said it was believable that Pakistani intelligence did not know that<br />
   Bin Laden was hiding out in Abbottobad, when he was killed there. &quot;It is<br />
   credible to me that they did not know. We received no intelligence<br />
   whatsoever to indicate that there was any awareness that he was there.&quot;<br />
<br />
   But while &quot;we see the Bin Laden raid as an extraordinary success,<br />
   intelligence together with military forces, Pakistan sees it as an affront<br />
   to their national sovereignty, we've got to work our way through this&quot;.<br />
<br />
   &quot;We know what happens when we walk away from Pakistan and Afghanistan,<br />
   we've literally seen the movie before, it's called 'Charlie Wilson's War'<br />
   (about covert US support for anti-Soviet Afghan fighters) and indeed that<br />
   is not in my view a good option.<br />
    <br />
   &quot;However difficult the relationship maybe it's one we need to continue to<br />
   work, it's one where we need to recognize what our Pakistani partners have<br />
   done, they've sacrificed several thousand soldiers and police and their<br />
   civilians have suffered substantial levels of violence.&quot; AGENCIES<br />

   Mumbai blasts: Sleuths struggle to zero in on perpetrators<br />
<br />
    Published: Thursday, Jul 21, 2011, 10:00 IST | Updated: Thursday, Jul 21,<br />

<br />
   The investigating agencies probing into the July 13 blasts are yet to zero<br />
   in on the terror group or organisation responsible for the explosions.<br />
<br />
   Though the Maharashtra Anti-Terrorism Squad and the Mumbai Crime Branch<br />
   officials have been claiming that they have got vital leads and are<br />
   working on them to identify the terror outfit involved, but the outfita**s<br />
   signature is yet not clear.<br />
<br />
   a**There are clues on the group behind the blasts, but the signatures of<br />
   terror organisations involved are yet not clear,a** said a senior Central<br />
   investigative agency officer.<br />
<br />
   A week ago, three explosions in Kabutarkhana, Zaveri Bazaar and Opera<br />
   House rocked the city.<br />
<br />
   a**Most clues point out to the involvement of groups like Indian<br />
   Mujahideen but other evidences indicate there could be some other group<br />
   involved.a**<br />
<br />
   The Indian Mujahideen (IM), which is said to be the offshoot of the banned<br />
   Students Islamic Movement of India (SIMI), carried out terror attacks<br />
   across several states in the country. The attacks were mostly on the 13th<br />
   or 26th of the month.<br />
<br />
   The target areas have been mostly Hindu-dominated areas or areas<br />
   frequented by foreigners.<br />
<br />
   After every terror attack, an email is sent to claim the responsibility of<br />
   the attack. This has been the IMa**s signature in the past.<br />
   The date and the target match its signature in the July 13 blasts but no<br />
   one has claimed responsibility for the attack.<br />
<br />
   The IM module does not carry out a single attack but multiple ones. It has<br />
   been observed that the IM module uses explosives such as ammonium nitrate<br />
   and lead bombs.<br />
<br />
   Investigators suspect that IM could have changed its module or is making<br />
   use of small groups to carry out attacks. This might be making it<br />
   difficult to identify the group behind the blasts.<br />
<br />
   The involvement of Hindu terror groups is also being probed but there is<br />
   no evidence to prove this. Hindu terror groups, it has been observed, use<br />
   low-intensity explosives.<br />
<br />
   They have been targeting Muslim-dominated areas such as Malegaon. It has<br />
   been observed that Hindu terror outfits lack perfection in execution of<br />
   the attacks. This is why their outfit members have got killed while<br />
   carrying out attacks such as in Nanded in Maharashtra and Margao in Goa.<br />
<br />
   Another suspicion is the involvement of a Kashmiri group as July 13 is<br />
   observed as Kashmir Martyrsa** Day. Teams of investigating agencies from<br />
   the state as well as the Centre have fanned out across the country looking<br />
   for clues.<br />

   Naxals attack Congress leadersa** convoy near Raipur, kill 4 workers<br />
   http://www.indianexpress.com/news/Naxals-attack-Congress-leaders--convoy-near-Raipur--kill-4-workers/820206/<br />
<br />
   Senior Congress leaders in Chhattisgarh had a narrow escape on Wednesday<br />
   when Maoists attacked their convoy, killing four party workers and leaving<br />
   five wounded near Udanti river between Mainpur and Deobhog police<br />
   stations.<br />
<br />
   Chhattisgarh Congress president Nandkumar Patel and three legislators were<br />
   part of a convoy of 35 to 40 vehicles that was heading back to Raipur<br />
   after attending a farmersa** rally when a group of 20-25 suspected Maoists<br />
   attacked the vehicles towards the tail, about 180 km from Raipur.<br />
    <br />
   An Intelligence officer said Patel and others did not appear to be the<br />
   target and the Maoists probably mistook the vehicles carrying workers as<br />
   those of the police.<br />
    <br />
   The vehicles carrying Patel and others were 10-12 km ahead of the workers<br />
   who were ambushed by the Maoists who blew up a vehicle before opening<br />
   fire.<br />
    <br />
   The blast killed three workers while one died of bullet injuries,<br />
   Additional DG Ram Niwas told said on phone from Raipur.<br />
<br />
   The Congress party blamed the Raman Singh government for failing to<br />
   provide them adequate security despite informing the authorities about the<br />
   rally three days in advance.<br />
<br />
   Raman Singh, who returned to Raipur from New Delhi, said Patel was not the<br />
   target but Leader of Opposition Ravindra Choube wanted to know the basis<br />
   of the Chief Ministera**s assumption.<br />
    <br />
   a**I think I was the target because the attack took place barely two-three<br />
   minutes after my vehicle had passed the spot,a** Patel told The Indian<br />
   Express. a**The security provided to us was next to nil.a**<br />
<br />
   Senior Congress leaders will attend the funeral of the slain workers to be<br />
   held on Thursday.<br />

    Peshawar, 20 July: The security forces have seized an IED (Improvised    <br />
    Explosive Devise) planted in holy Koran in South Waziristan Agency. A    <br />
    security official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said militants    <br />
    were adopting new procedures as their previous plans had started failing <br />
    to succeed. He said seizure of IED from the holy Koran has rung alarm    <br />
    bells among the security forces as such a disgrace of the holy book was  <br />
    not in mind of anyone.                                                   <br />

    However, he continued, such acts reflected the moral degradation of the  <br />
    militants who in their last ditch efforts were making such stupid and    <br />
    deplorable attempts.                                                     <br />
