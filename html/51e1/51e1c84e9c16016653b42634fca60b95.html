		<h3>Tor</h3>
		<p><a href="https://www.torproject.org">Tor</a> is an encrypted anonymising network that makes it harder to intercept internet communications, or see where communications are coming from or going to.</p>
		<p>In order to use the WikiLeaks public submission system as detailed above you can download the Tor Browser Bundle, which is a Firefox-like browser available for Windows, Mac OS X and GNU/Linux and pre-configured to connect using the anonymising system Tor.</p>
		<h4>Tails</h4>
		<p>If you are at high risk and you have the capacity to do so, you can also access the submission system through a secure operating system called <a href="https://tails.boum.org">Tails</a>. Tails is an operating system launched from a USB stick or a DVD that aim to leaves no traces when the computer is shut down after use and automatically routes your internet traffic through Tor. Tails will require you to have either a USB stick or a DVD at least 4GB big and a laptop or desktop computer.</p>

		<h3>Tips</h3>
		<p>Our submission system works hard to preserve your anonymity, but we recommend you also take some of your own precautions. Please review these basic guidelines. </p>
		<div>
			<h4>1. Contact us if you have specific problems</h4>
			<p>If you have a very large submission, or a submission with a complex format, or are a high-risk source, please <a href="#submit_help_contact">contact us</a>. In our experience it is always possible to find a custom solution for even the most seemingly difficult situations.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h4>2. What computer to use</h4>
			<p>If the computer you are uploading from could subsequently be audited in an investigation, consider using a computer that is not easily tied to you. Technical users can also use <a href="https://tails.boum.org">Tails</a> to help ensure you do not leave any records of your submission on the computer.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h4>3. Do not talk about your submission to others</h4>
			<p>If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in source protection – it is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This includes other media organisations.</p>
		</div>

	</div>

		<h3>After</h3>

		<div>
			<h4>1. Do not talk about your submission to others</h4>
			<p>If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in source protection – it is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This includes other media organisations.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h4>2. Act normal</h4>
			<p>If you are a high-risk source, avoid saying anything or doing anything after submitting which might promote suspicion. In particular, you should try to stick to your normal routine and behaviour.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h4>3. Remove traces of your submission</h4>
			<p>If you are a high-risk source and the computer you prepared your submission on, or uploaded it from, could subsequently be audited in an investigation, we recommend that you format and dispose of the computer hard drive and any other storage media you used.</p>
			<p>In particular, hard drives retain data after formatting which may be visible to a digital forensics team and flash media (USB sticks, memory cards and SSD drives) retain data even after a secure erasure. If you used flash media to store sensitive data, it is important to destroy the media.</p>
			<p>If you do this and are a high-risk source you should make sure there are no traces of the clean-up, since such traces themselves may draw suspicion.</p>
			<div>
				<h4>4. If you face legal action</h4>
				<p>If a legal action is brought against you as a result of your submission, there are organisations that may help you. The Courage Foundation is an international organisation dedicated to the protection of journalistic sources. You can find more details at <a href="https://www.couragefound.org">https://www.couragefound.org</a>.</p>

		<p>WikiLeaks publishes documents of political or historical importance that are censored or otherwise suppressed. We specialise in strategic global publishing and large archives.</p>
		<p>The following is the address of our secure site where you can anonymously upload your documents to WikiLeaks editors. You can only access this submissions system through Tor. (See our <a href="#submit_help_tor">Tor tab</a> for more information.) We also advise you to read our <a href="#submit_help_tips">tips for sources</a> before submitting.</p>

			<!--<div>
				Copy this address into your Tor browser. Advanced users, if they wish, can also add a further layer of encryption to their submission using <a href="#submit_wlkey">our public PGP key</a>.
			</div>-->
		</div>

		<p>If you cannot use Tor, or your submission is very large, or you have specific requirements, WikiLeaks provides several alternative methods. <a href="#submit_help_contact">Contact us</a> to discuss how to proceed.</p>

HISTORIC MISSIONARY AND COMMERCIAL CONTACT CONTRIBUTED
TO HIGH CANADIAN EXPECTATIONS FOR DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS
ESTABLISHED WITH PRC IN 1970. NUMEROUS CANADIAN MINISTERS
MADE PEKING PILGRIMAGE, CULMINATING IN 1973 TRUDEAU TRIP.

HEADY SURGE, THERE WAS PERIOD OF REASSESSMENT WHEN LIMITED
PROSPECTS FOR RELATIONSHIP BECAME MORE CLEAR. DISAPPOINTMENTS INCLUDED LARGELY ONE-WAY NATURE OF VIP FLOW AND
TAPERING OFF OF GROWTH IN EXPORT SALES. INITIATIVE SEEMED
ALWAYS TO COME FROM CANADIAN SIDE. OFFICIAL EVALUATION OF
BILATERAL RELATIONSHIP COMPLETED IN EARLY 1978 TOOK SATISFACTION THAT CANADA HAD HELPED LEAD CHINA OUT OF ISOLATION,

BUT CONCLUDED SIMPLY THAT &quot;SOUND FOUNDATION&quot; HAD BEEN
REACHED ON WHICH PARTIES COULD &quot;CONTINUE TO CONSTRUCT
RELATIONSHIP AIMED AT INCREASING THEIR AWARENESS&quot; OF EACH
OTHER. HOWEVER, RECENT CHINESE OUTWARD THRUST IS GIVING
NEW DIMENSION TO RELATIONSHIP. FOREIGN MINISTER HUANG HUA
CHOSE OTTAWA FOR HIS FIRST BILATERAL VISIT ABROAD AND
ENSUING TIDE OF CHINESE TECHNICAL MISSIONS ABSORBING
CANADIAN IDEAS IN SPONGELIKE FASHION HAS REACHED &quot;FLOOD&quot;
PROPORTIONS. CANADIANS SEE CHINESE INITIATIVE TO TRAIN
10,000 STUDENTS ABROAD, INCLUDING 500 IN CANADA, AS LOGICAL
PART OF THIS OUTREACH. THIS ACTIVITY IS FURTHER STIMULATING CANADA'S TRADITIONALLY HIGH PUBLIC INTEREST IN CHINA,
AND REVITALIZED BUSINESS INTEREST IN PRC WAS EVIDENT IN
RECENT PRIVATELY ORGANIZED TRADE MISSION COMPRISING TOP
LEADERS OF CANADIAN INDUSTRY. END SUMMARY.
2. CANADA HAD HIGH EXPECTATIONS WHEN DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS
WERE ESTABLISHED WITH PRC IN OCTOBER 1970. THEY SEEMED
NATURAL RESUMPTION OF CONTACTS DATING BACK TO 19TH CENTURY
ACTIVITIES OF CANADIAN MERCHANTS AND MISSIONARIES IN CHINA.
KEY FIGURE IN MYTHOLOGY WHICH HAS GROWN UP (WITH OFFICIAL
ENCOURAGEMENT) AROUND CANADA'S HISTORICAL RELATIONSHIP WITH
CHINA IS NORMAN BETHUNE, CANADIAN SURGEON WHO SERVED
CHINESE EIGHTH ROUTE ARMY IN 1938-39, WAS EULOGIZED BY
MAO TSE-TUNG, AND BECAME &quot;ONE OF THE BEST-KNOWN NON-CHINESE
HISTORICAL FIGURES IN CHINA TODAY&quot;. CHINESE VICECONFIDENTIAL

MINISTERIAL DELEGATION VISITED CANADA IN 1976 FOR CEREMONY
AT BETHUNE'S BIRTHPLACE, AND SIMILAR CANADIAN GROUP HAS
BEEN INVITED TO COMMEMORATION OF BETHUNE'S DEATH IN CHINA
NEXT YEAR. HISTORICAL RELATIONSHIP HAS HAD INESCAPABLE
IMPACT ON MODERN RELATIONS SINCE ALL THREE OF CANADA'S
AMBASSADORS TO PRC WERE BORN IN CHINA AND SPEAK CHINESE.
FATHER OF PRESENT CANADIAN ENVOY, ARTHUR MENZIES, WAS
PROMINENT MISSIONARY-ARCHAEOLOGIST IN CHINA.
3. UNOFFICIAL CONTACT CONTINUED DESPITE ABSENCE OF DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS WITH PEKING FOR TWO DECADES AFTER
COMMUNIST TAKE-OVER. CHINA EMERGED AS MAJOR MARKET FOR
CANADIAN WHEAT AFTER 1960, AND LIST OF CANADIANS WHO
VISITED PRC BETWEEN 1949 AND 1970 INCLUDED PIERRE ELLIOTT
TRUDEAU IN 1960. TRUDEAU FOLLOWED UP WITH 1968 PLEDGE
THAT, IF HE BECAME PRIME MINISTER, HE WOULD REVIEW CANADA'S
CHINA POLICY AND INITIATE DISCUSSIONS WITH PRC ON ESTABLISHMENT OF RELATIONS.

CANADIANS NOTE WITH PRIDE THAT FORMULA THEY WORKED OUT IN
1970 HAS SINCE BEEN FOLLOWED BY MANY COUNTRIES &quot;WHICH
FOLLOWED CANADA'S LEAD IN ESTABLISHING RELATIONS WITH
PEKING.&quot; (CANADA RECOGNIZED PRC AS SOLE LEGAL GOVERNMENT
OF CHINA AND TOOK NOTE OF ITS AFFIRMATION THAT TAIWAN WAS

POLITICS.
6. WE SURMISE THAT, IN ADDITION TO COMMERCIAL INTERESTS
AND HISTORICAL FACTORS, PRC WAS INITIALLY ATTRACTED TO
OTTAWA AS STRATEGICALLY PLACED WINDOW ON NORTH AMERICA.
IN FACT, PRC'S FIRST AMBASSADOR TO CANADA, HUANG HUA,
WAS TRANSFERRED DIRECTLY FROM OTTAWA TO NEW YORK IN 1972
WHEN PRC OPENED UN MISSION. ANOTHER PRESUMED PRC
OBJECTIVE WAS SQUARELY IDEOLOGICAL: TO SENSITIZE CANADIANS
TO IMPLICATIONS OF INTERPOSITION BETWEEN TWO SUPER POWERS.
LECTURES ON DANGERS OF HEGEMONISM HAVE COUNTED FOR MUCH OF
CHINESE CONTRIBUTION TO BILATERAL DIALOGUE.
7. CANADIAN MINISTERS PLUNGED WITH RELISH INTO NEW
RELATIONSHIP ESTABLISHED IN 1970. FIRST GOVERNMENT MISSION
VISITED PEKING FOLLOWING SUMMER UNDER LEADERSHIP OF
CANADIAN MINISTER OF INDUSTRY TO ESTABLISH CONTACT IN
BROAD RANGE OF ECONOMIC AND COMMERCIAL ACTIVITIES. DELEGATION WON CHINESE AGREEMENT &quot;TO CONSIDER CANADA FIRST&quot;
AS SOURCE OF WHEAT, AND REACHED UNDERSTANDING IN PRINCIPLE
ON FURTHER COMMERCIAL MISSIONS, TRADE EXHIBITIONS AND
TRADE CONSULTATIONS. FOREIGN MINISTER MITCHELL SHARP
FOLLOWED UP IN 1972 WITH OFFICIAL VISIT TO OPEN CANADIAN
SOLO TRADE FAIR IN PEKING. MINISTER OF ENERGY, MINES AND
RESOURCES TRAVELLED IN APRIL 1973. MINISTER OF STATE FOR

SIGNING OF LONG-TERM WHEAT AGREEMENT PROVIDING FOR PURCHASE
OF UP TO 224 MILLION BUSHELS OVER THREE YEARS. CIVIL AIR
ACCORD AND ACADEMIC EXCHANGE PROGRAM WERE AMONG OTHER
BILATERAL AGREEMENTS CONCLUDED DURING 1973 VISITS.
8. PERIOD OF REASSESSMENT WAS NO DOUBT INEVITABLE TO
BRING HEADY CANADIAN EXPECTATIONS MORE INTO LINE WITH
REALISTIC PROSPECTS FOR RELATIONS BETWEEN TWO COUNTRIES
SEPARATED BY VAST IDEOLOGICAL AND GEOGRAPHIC DISTANCES.
CANADIANS BEGAN TO TAKE NOTE OF DISEQUILIBRIUM IN FLOW OF
HIGH-LEVEL TRAVEL. ONE 1977 ACADEMIC STUDY POINTED OUT
THAT CHINESE HAD DISPATCHED ONLY ONE MINISTER AND ONE
DEPUTY MINISTER TO CANADA IN SEVEN YEARS, WHILE NO FEWER
THAN NINE CANADIAN MINISTERS AND PROMINENT PARLIAMENTARY
FIGURES, INCLUDING PRIME MINISTER, HAD TRAVELLED TO CHINA.
FURTHER, EXTAFF OFFICIALS NOW PRIVATELY ACKNOWLEDGE THAT
THESE VISITS WERE &quot;SHALLOW&quot; AND SUPERFICIAL. STUDY NOTED
THAT, IN EXPANDING BILATERAL RELATIONS, &quot;THE INITIATIVE
HAS NEARLY ALWAYS COME FROM THE CANADIAN SIDE.&quot; CRITICAL
ATTENTION WAS ALSO ATTRACTED TO CANADIAN EXPENDITURE OF
QUARTER MILLION DOLLARS TO RESTORE BETHUNE'S HOME AS SHRINE
FOR VISITING CHINESE, THOUGH HE WAS UNKNOWN TO 95 PERCENT
OF CANADIANS. NOTING CHINESE PREOCCUPATION WITH HEGEMONISM,
PRESS GROUSED THAT PRONOUNCEMENTS IN OTTAWA BY PRC SPOKESMEN WERE &quot;MESSAGE INTENDED FOR EARS IN WASHINGTON AS MUCH

FIRMS DECIDED CHINA WAS BAD NEWS AND DECLINED TO MAKE ANY

9. WHATEVER THE CANADIAN GOVERNMENT'S ORIGINAL EXPECTATIONS, TRADE BENEFITS FROM RELATIONSHIP WITH CHINA HAVE
BEEN RELATIVELY MODEST. EXPORTS ROSE BY ONLY C$200

EXPORTS. CANADIAN EXPORTS ACTUALLY DECREASED IN 1975 AND
1976. 1978 EXTAFF REPORT POINTED OUT THAT WHEAT HAD BEEN
ALMOST ONLY CANADIAN EXPORT TO PRC PRIOR TO DIPLOMATIC
RELATIONS, BUT PROPORTION OF NON-WHEAT ITEMS HAD, SINCE
1970, RISEN TO INCLUDE SUCH PRODUCTS AS NICKEL, PULP,
ALUMINUM, POTASH, GENERATING AND ELECTRONIC EQUIPMENT,
AIRCRAFT ENGINES, AND MEDICAL EQUIPMENT. HOWEVER, WHEAT
STILL ACCOUNTED FOR 83 PERCENT OF CANADA'S TOTAL MERCHANDISE EXPORTS TO CHINA IN 1977 AND WHEAT FOR CHINA REPRESENTED 21 PERCENT OF CANADA'S TOTAL WHEAT SHIPMENTS.
WHILE EXPORTS OF INDUSTRIAL MATERIALS HAVE GROWN, FINISHED
GOODS REPRESENTED ONLY 0.3 PERCENT OF TOTAL SALES TO CHINA
IN 1977. CHINESE EXPORTS TO CANADA HAVE RISEN, BUT LARGE
IMBALANCE IN CANADA'S FAVOR CONTINUES. IMPORTS FROM PRC
TOTALLED ONLY C$82 MILLION IN 1977 AND CONSISTED LARGELY
OF CLOTHING.
10. RECENT GLOBE AND MAIL ANALYSIS SUGGESTED THAT CANADA
WAS STILL SEEN BY CHINESE AS RAW MATERIALS SUPPLIER, AND
PEKING WAS UNLIKELY TO BE WILLING TO ALLOW ITS CURRENT
TRADE IMBALANCE TO WORSEN BY BUYING FINISHED PRODUCTS
FROM CANADA WHICH COULD BE PURCHASED ELSEWHERE. FURTHER,
CANADIANS HAD NOT HAD INTEREST OR PATIENCE NECESSARY TO

ARTICLE CITED EXPERT OPINION THAT CANADA COULD NOT COMPETE
WITH JAPAN, WESTERN EUROPE AND US &quot;IN MOST AREAS OF
POTENTIAL EXPORTS TO CHINA.&quot;
11. SIMILARLY, GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS CITE FOLLOWING
FACTORS LIMITING GROWTH OF CHINESE MARKET FOR CANADIAN
GOODS: (A) PRC POLICY OF HOLDING IMPORTS TO A MINIMUM AND
OF DIVERSIFYING SOURCES OF SUPPLY FOR WHEAT; (B) DETERIORATION IN CANADIAN COMPETITIVE POSITION IN MANUFACTURES

(WHICH COULD BE MITIGATED BY SHARP DEPRECIATION OF
CANADIAN DOLLAR AGAINST OTHER MAJOR CURRENCIES IN PAST
YEAR); (C) TRADE AGREEMENT WITH EEC WHICH ACCORDS PREFERENCE IN PRC MARKET TO EUROPEAN SUPPLIERS, AND (D)
RELUCTANCE OF CANADIAN FIRMS TO SHOULDER COSTS OF GAINING
FOOTHOLD IN MARKET WHICH MAY PRODUCE SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL
RETURNS ONLY IN LONG RUN. DURING BILATERAL TRADE CONSULTATIONS, CANADIAN SIDE PRESSES FOR TRADE EXPANSION, WHILE
CHINESE STRESS THAT INCREASED TECHNOLOGICAL COOPERATION
WILL HELP EXPAND MARKETS FOR CANADIAN MANUFACTURED
PRODUCTS.
12. DESPITE HUANG HUA'S TRANSFER FROM OTTAWA TO NEW YORK,
RELATIONS WITH CHINA AT UN HAVE BEEN LIMITED. CANADA
PLAYED PART IN PEKING'S ACCESSION TO UN SEAT; AFTER 1966
IT ABSTAINED ON ANNUAL ALBANIAN RESOLUTION WHICH WOULD
HAVE GIVEN CHINA SEAT TO PEKING, AND, BEGINNING IN 1970,
CANADA VOTED TO SEAT PRC ON GROUNDS THAT &quot;GOVERNMENT THAT
HAS RESPONSIBILITY FOR OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF CHINESE
PEOPLE MUST NOW TAKE ITS PROPER PLACE.&quot; HOWEVER, EXTAFF
SOURCE DESCRIBES CHINESE AS &quot;ALOOF&quot; IN MULTILATERAL
SETTINGS AND UNINTERESTED IN ANY ISSUES EXCEPT OCCASIONAL
ITEMS WHICH (1) CONCERN CHINA DIRECTLY, (2) OFFER
OPPORTUNITIES TO DEMONSTRATE SOLIDARITY WITH LDC'S, OR
(3) PROVIDE OCCASIONS FOR JABS AT SOVIETS. IN RECENT
MONTHS CANADIANS HAVE SOUGHT TO CONVEY CONCERN OVER
CAMBODIAN HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS THROUGH CHINESE WITH
MIXED RESULTS. CANADIANS BELIEVE THEIR APPROACH MAY HAVE
BEEN INSTRUMENTAL IN LEADING PRC TO CAUTION KAMPUCHEAN

POLICIES WERE CREATING. BUT, IN RECENT BILATERAL WITH

HUANG HUA CHOSE OTTAWA FOR HIS FIRST VISIT ABROAD IN
OCTOBER 1977 (77 OTTAWA 9085; 77 USNATO 10078). (HUA,
WHO EVIDENTLY RECALLS HIS DAYS AS AMBASSADOR TO CANADA
WITH SPECIAL WARMTH, REPORTEDLY LINGERED NOTICEABLY WITH
CANADIAN AMBASSADOR AT RECEPTION DURING HIS RECENT ROMANIAN
TRIP, REMARKING LATER THAT &quot;CANADA IS A GREAT COUNTRY&quot;.)
THERE ALSO HAS BEEN PRESS SPECULATION THAT CANADIAN VISIT
BY CHAIRMAN HUA KUO FENG IS LIKELY EARLY NEXT YEAR, BUT
EXTAFF AND CHINESE EMBASSY SAY THIS IS UNLIKELY.
15. HUA'S VISIT HAS BEEN FOLLOWED BY WHAT ONE EXTAFF
OFFICIAL TERMS A &quot;FLOOD&quot; OF CHINESE DELEGATIONS. SOME
HAVE BEEN HIGHLY VISIBLE BUT WITH LIMITED SUBSTANTIVE
IMPORT, SUCH AS TWENTY-NINE MAN PRC MISSION LED BY VICE
CHAIRMAN AND SECGEN OF NATIONAL PEOPLE'S CONGRESS CHI
PENG FEI, WHICH VISITED CANADA IN JUNE 1978. OF MORE
SIGNIFICANCE MAY BE STREAM OF CHINESE EXPERTS WHO HAVE
BEEN QUIETLY SCOURING CANADA FOR WESTERN TECHNOLOGY.
RECENT EXAMPLE IS AGRICULTURAL DELEGATION HEADED BY PRC
VICE-MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE WHICH VISITED PRAIRIE
PROVINCES FOR FOUR WEEKS IN AUGUST-SEPTEMBER TO STUDY
LAND RECLAMATION, MECHANIZATION AND AMBITIOUS RANGE OF
OTHER AGRICULTURAL TOPICS. CHINESE VICE-MINISTER OF
EDUCATION IS CURRENTLY IN OTTAWA TO LOOK INTO AUDIOVISUAL EQUIPMENT. OFFICIALS IN EXTAFF'S NORTHEAST ASIAN
DIVISION REGARD SUCH TRIPS AS EVIDENCE OF CONCENTRATED
CHINESE EFFORT TO ABSORB WESTERN KNOWHOW IN SPONGELIKE
FASHION FOR SYSTEMATIC APPLICATION IN CHINA. THEY

CONSIDER IT NOTEWORTHY THAT CHINESE HAVE SHED PREVIOUS
RETICENCE ON ACCEPTING FOREIGN AID, AND NOW HAVE NO
QUALMS ABOUT SEEKING CONCESSIONAL TERMS IN BEST LDC
TRADITION.
16. CANADIANS THUS SEE CHINESE INITIATIVE (OTTAWA 4745
AND 4031) TO TRAIN AS MANY AS 10,000 STUDENTS IN WEST
(INCLUDING 500 IN CANADA) AS LOGICAL EXTENSION OF SPONGE
PHENOMENON THEY HAVE BEEN OBSERVING IN RECENT MONTHS IN
OTHER AREAS OF RELATIONSHIP. OFFICIALS HERE WERE
GENERALLY PLEASED WITH CONDUCT OF CHINESE STUDYING IN
CANADA UNDER EARLIER, SMALL-SCALE EXCHANGE PROGRAM, AND
THEY WELCOMED NEW PROPOSAL AS OPPORTUNITY TO GENERATE
GOODWILL TRANSFERABLE TO OTHER AREAS OF BILATERAL
RELATIONSHIP. HOWEVER, CANADIANS ARE DETERMINED THAT
CHINESE WILL PAY EVERY PENNY OF PROGRAM'S COST (AND ARE
WAITING WITH INTEREST TO SEE IF PEKING AGREES).

CONSIDERABLY MORE PREOCCUPIED THESE DAYS WITH DOMESTIC
PROBLEMS THAN THEY ARE WITH THE OUTSIDE WORLD, COLUMN
INCHES DEVOTED TO CHINA IN RECENT MONTHS HAVE ECLIPSED
THOSE ON ALL OTHER COUNTRIES EXCEPTING U.S.

INTO OUTSIDE WORLD IS THAT CANADIAN OFFICIALS FEEL THEY
CAN NO LONGER LAY CLAIM TO BEST RELATIONSHIP WITH PRC
OF ANY WESTERN COUNTRY. THEY RECOGNIZE HIGHER IMPORTANCE
FOR CHINA WHICH RELATIONS WITH EEC, JAPAN AND,POTENTIALLY,
U.S. HOLD. IN CONVERSATION WITH EMBOFF, ONE EXTAFF

HEADY SURGE, THERE WAS PERIOD OF REASSESSMENT WHEN LIMITED
PROSPECTS FOR RELATIONSHIP BECAME MORE CLEAR. DISAPPOINTMENTS INCLUDED LARGELY ONE-WAY NATURE OF VIP FLOW AND
TAPERING OFF OF GROWTH IN EXPORT SALES. INITIATIVE SEEMED
ALWAYS TO COME FROM CANADIAN SIDE. OFFICIAL EVALUATION OF
BILATERAL RELATIONSHIP COMPLETED IN EARLY 1978 TOOK SATISFACTION THAT CANADA HAD HELPED LEAD CHINA OUT OF ISOLATION,

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
BUT CONCLUDED SIMPLY THAT &quot;SOUND FOUNDATION&quot; HAD BEEN
REACHED ON WHICH PARTIES COULD &quot;CONTINUE TO CONSTRUCT
RELATIONSHIP AIMED AT INCREASING THEIR AWARENESS&quot; OF EACH
OTHER. HOWEVER, RECENT CHINESE OUTWARD THRUST IS GIVING
NEW DIMENSION TO RELATIONSHIP. FOREIGN MINISTER HUANG HUA
CHOSE OTTAWA FOR HIS FIRST BILATERAL VISIT ABROAD AND
ENSUING TIDE OF CHINESE TECHNICAL MISSIONS ABSORBING
CANADIAN IDEAS IN SPONGELIKE FASHION HAS REACHED &quot;FLOOD&quot;
PROPORTIONS. CANADIANS SEE CHINESE INITIATIVE TO TRAIN
10,000 STUDENTS ABROAD, INCLUDING 500 IN CANADA, AS LOGICAL
PART OF THIS OUTREACH. THIS ACTIVITY IS FURTHER STIMULATING CANADA'S TRADITIONALLY HIGH PUBLIC INTEREST IN CHINA,
AND REVITALIZED BUSINESS INTEREST IN PRC WAS EVIDENT IN
RECENT PRIVATELY ORGANIZED TRADE MISSION COMPRISING TOP
LEADERS OF CANADIAN INDUSTRY. END SUMMARY.
2. CANADA HAD HIGH EXPECTATIONS WHEN DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS
WERE ESTABLISHED WITH PRC IN OCTOBER 1970. THEY SEEMED
NATURAL RESUMPTION OF CONTACTS DATING BACK TO 19TH CENTURY
ACTIVITIES OF CANADIAN MERCHANTS AND MISSIONARIES IN CHINA.
KEY FIGURE IN MYTHOLOGY WHICH HAS GROWN UP (WITH OFFICIAL
ENCOURAGEMENT) AROUND CANADA'S HISTORICAL RELATIONSHIP WITH
CHINA IS NORMAN BETHUNE, CANADIAN SURGEON WHO SERVED
CHINESE EIGHTH ROUTE ARMY IN 1938-39, WAS EULOGIZED BY
MAO TSE-TUNG, AND BECAME &quot;ONE OF THE BEST-KNOWN NON-CHINESE
HISTORICAL FIGURES IN CHINA TODAY&quot;. CHINESE VICECONFIDENTIAL

MINISTERIAL DELEGATION VISITED CANADA IN 1976 FOR CEREMONY
AT BETHUNE'S BIRTHPLACE, AND SIMILAR CANADIAN GROUP HAS
BEEN INVITED TO COMMEMORATION OF BETHUNE'S DEATH IN CHINA
NEXT YEAR. HISTORICAL RELATIONSHIP HAS HAD INESCAPABLE
IMPACT ON MODERN RELATIONS SINCE ALL THREE OF CANADA'S
AMBASSADORS TO PRC WERE BORN IN CHINA AND SPEAK CHINESE.
FATHER OF PRESENT CANADIAN ENVOY, ARTHUR MENZIES, WAS
PROMINENT MISSIONARY-ARCHAEOLOGIST IN CHINA.
3. UNOFFICIAL CONTACT CONTINUED DESPITE ABSENCE OF DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS WITH PEKING FOR TWO DECADES AFTER
COMMUNIST TAKE-OVER. CHINA EMERGED AS MAJOR MARKET FOR
CANADIAN WHEAT AFTER 1960, AND LIST OF CANADIANS WHO
VISITED PRC BETWEEN 1949 AND 1970 INCLUDED PIERRE ELLIOTT
TRUDEAU IN 1960. TRUDEAU FOLLOWED UP WITH 1968 PLEDGE
THAT, IF HE BECAME PRIME MINISTER, HE WOULD REVIEW CANADA'S
CHINA POLICY AND INITIATE DISCUSSIONS WITH PRC ON ESTABLISHMENT OF RELATIONS.
4. AS PUBLIC PERCEPTIONS OF CHINA RECOGNITION ISSUE
SHIFTED, IDEA TOOK HOLD THAT CANADA HAD SPECIAL ROLE TO
PLAY IN LEADING PRC INTO CONTACT WITH OUTSIDE WORLD. 1970

OPTION&quot; POLICY ADOPTED BY CANADA IN 1972 WHICH ENVISAGED
CONCENTRATED DRIVE TO EXPAND RELATIONS ELSEWHERE AS ANTIDOTE TO EXCESSIVE ECONOMIC DEPENDENCE ON U.S. AND IN
ORDER TO ESTABLISH DISTINCT IDENTITY IN INTERNATIONAL
POLITICS.
6. WE SURMISE THAT, IN ADDITION TO COMMERCIAL INTERESTS
AND HISTORICAL FACTORS, PRC WAS INITIALLY ATTRACTED TO
OTTAWA AS STRATEGICALLY PLACED WINDOW ON NORTH AMERICA.
IN FACT, PRC'S FIRST AMBASSADOR TO CANADA, HUANG HUA,
WAS TRANSFERRED DIRECTLY FROM OTTAWA TO NEW YORK IN 1972
WHEN PRC OPENED UN MISSION. ANOTHER PRESUMED PRC
OBJECTIVE WAS SQUARELY IDEOLOGICAL: TO SENSITIZE CANADIANS
TO IMPLICATIONS OF INTERPOSITION BETWEEN TWO SUPER POWERS.
LECTURES ON DANGERS OF HEGEMONISM HAVE COUNTED FOR MUCH OF
CHINESE CONTRIBUTION TO BILATERAL DIALOGUE.
7. CANADIAN MINISTERS PLUNGED WITH RELISH INTO NEW
RELATIONSHIP ESTABLISHED IN 1970. FIRST GOVERNMENT MISSION
VISITED PEKING FOLLOWING SUMMER UNDER LEADERSHIP OF
CANADIAN MINISTER OF INDUSTRY TO ESTABLISH CONTACT IN
BROAD RANGE OF ECONOMIC AND COMMERCIAL ACTIVITIES. DELEGATION WON CHINESE AGREEMENT &quot;TO CONSIDER CANADA FIRST&quot;
AS SOURCE OF WHEAT, AND REACHED UNDERSTANDING IN PRINCIPLE
ON FURTHER COMMERCIAL MISSIONS, TRADE EXHIBITIONS AND
TRADE CONSULTATIONS. FOREIGN MINISTER MITCHELL SHARP
FOLLOWED UP IN 1972 WITH OFFICIAL VISIT TO OPEN CANADIAN
SOLO TRADE FAIR IN PEKING. MINISTER OF ENERGY, MINES AND
RESOURCES TRAVELLED IN APRIL 1973. MINISTER OF STATE FOR
SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY LED MISSION THAT SEPTEMBER. PATTERN

SIGNING OF LONG-TERM WHEAT AGREEMENT PROVIDING FOR PURCHASE
OF UP TO 224 MILLION BUSHELS OVER THREE YEARS. CIVIL AIR
ACCORD AND ACADEMIC EXCHANGE PROGRAM WERE AMONG OTHER
BILATERAL AGREEMENTS CONCLUDED DURING 1973 VISITS.
8. PERIOD OF REASSESSMENT WAS NO DOUBT INEVITABLE TO
BRING HEADY CANADIAN EXPECTATIONS MORE INTO LINE WITH
REALISTIC PROSPECTS FOR RELATIONS BETWEEN TWO COUNTRIES
SEPARATED BY VAST IDEOLOGICAL AND GEOGRAPHIC DISTANCES.
CANADIANS BEGAN TO TAKE NOTE OF DISEQUILIBRIUM IN FLOW OF
HIGH-LEVEL TRAVEL. ONE 1977 ACADEMIC STUDY POINTED OUT
THAT CHINESE HAD DISPATCHED ONLY ONE MINISTER AND ONE
DEPUTY MINISTER TO CANADA IN SEVEN YEARS, WHILE NO FEWER
THAN NINE CANADIAN MINISTERS AND PROMINENT PARLIAMENTARY
FIGURES, INCLUDING PRIME MINISTER, HAD TRAVELLED TO CHINA.
FURTHER, EXTAFF OFFICIALS NOW PRIVATELY ACKNOWLEDGE THAT
THESE VISITS WERE &quot;SHALLOW&quot; AND SUPERFICIAL. STUDY NOTED
THAT, IN EXPANDING BILATERAL RELATIONS, &quot;THE INITIATIVE
HAS NEARLY ALWAYS COME FROM THE CANADIAN SIDE.&quot; CRITICAL
ATTENTION WAS ALSO ATTRACTED TO CANADIAN EXPENDITURE OF
QUARTER MILLION DOLLARS TO RESTORE BETHUNE'S HOME AS SHRINE
FOR VISITING CHINESE, THOUGH HE WAS UNKNOWN TO 95 PERCENT
OF CANADIANS. NOTING CHINESE PREOCCUPATION WITH HEGEMONISM,
PRESS GROUSED THAT PRONOUNCEMENTS IN OTTAWA BY PRC SPOKESMEN WERE &quot;MESSAGE INTENDED FOR EARS IN WASHINGTON AS MUCH

CHINA. THERE WAS EVIDENT DISPROPORTION BETWEEN CHINESE
ACTIVITIES IN CANADA AND CANADA'S SOLO FAIR IN PEKING,
WHICH WAS LARGEST COMMERCIAL EVENT NATION HAD EVER HELD
ABROAD; TO MAKE THINGS WORSE, PRESS TERMED FAIR
&quot;DISASTROUS&quot;, POINTING OUT THAT 236 PARTICIPATING COMPANIES
SOLD &quot;VIRTUALLY NOTHING&quot; (ONLY C$28 MILLION). &quot;AFTER
THAT&quot;, IN WORDS OF TORONTO GLOBE AND MAIL, &quot;MANY CANADIAN
FIRMS DECIDED CHINA WAS BAD NEWS AND DECLINED TO MAKE ANY
FURTHER EFFORTS.&quot;
9. WHATEVER THE CANADIAN GOVERNMENT'S ORIGINAL EXPECTATIONS, TRADE BENEFITS FROM RELATIONSHIP WITH CHINA HAVE
BEEN RELATIVELY MODEST. EXPORTS ROSE BY ONLY C$200
MILLION OVER LAST TEN YEARS AND TOTALLED C$360 MILLION IN
1977--LESS THAN ONE PERCENT OF CANADA'S TOTAL MERCHANDISE

OTTAWA 05225 03 OF 06 262339Z

EXPORTS. CANADIAN EXPORTS ACTUALLY DECREASED IN 1975 AND
1976. 1978 EXTAFF REPORT POINTED OUT THAT WHEAT HAD BEEN
ALMOST ONLY CANADIAN EXPORT TO PRC PRIOR TO DIPLOMATIC
RELATIONS, BUT PROPORTION OF NON-WHEAT ITEMS HAD, SINCE
1970, RISEN TO INCLUDE SUCH PRODUCTS AS NICKEL, PULP,
ALUMINUM, POTASH, GENERATING AND ELECTRONIC EQUIPMENT,
AIRCRAFT ENGINES, AND MEDICAL EQUIPMENT. HOWEVER, WHEAT
STILL ACCOUNTED FOR 83 PERCENT OF CANADA'S TOTAL MERCHANDISE EXPORTS TO CHINA IN 1977 AND WHEAT FOR CHINA REPRESENTED 21 PERCENT OF CANADA'S TOTAL WHEAT SHIPMENTS.
WHILE EXPORTS OF INDUSTRIAL MATERIALS HAVE GROWN, FINISHED
GOODS REPRESENTED ONLY 0.3 PERCENT OF TOTAL SALES TO CHINA
IN 1977. CHINESE EXPORTS TO CANADA HAVE RISEN, BUT LARGE
IMBALANCE IN CANADA'S FAVOR CONTINUES. IMPORTS FROM PRC
TOTALLED ONLY C$82 MILLION IN 1977 AND CONSISTED LARGELY
OF CLOTHING.
10. RECENT GLOBE AND MAIL ANALYSIS SUGGESTED THAT CANADA
WAS STILL SEEN BY CHINESE AS RAW MATERIALS SUPPLIER, AND
PEKING WAS UNLIKELY TO BE WILLING TO ALLOW ITS CURRENT
TRADE IMBALANCE TO WORSEN BY BUYING FINISHED PRODUCTS
FROM CANADA WHICH COULD BE PURCHASED ELSEWHERE. FURTHER,
CANADIANS HAD NOT HAD INTEREST OR PATIENCE NECESSARY TO

PUT TOGETHER CONSORTIA TO BID ON MAJOR CHINESE PROJECTS.
ARTICLE CITED EXPERT OPINION THAT CANADA COULD NOT COMPETE
WITH JAPAN, WESTERN EUROPE AND US &quot;IN MOST AREAS OF
POTENTIAL EXPORTS TO CHINA.&quot;
11. SIMILARLY, GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS CITE FOLLOWING
FACTORS LIMITING GROWTH OF CHINESE MARKET FOR CANADIAN
GOODS: (A) PRC POLICY OF HOLDING IMPORTS TO A MINIMUM AND
OF DIVERSIFYING SOURCES OF SUPPLY FOR WHEAT; (B) DETERIORATION IN CANADIAN COMPETITIVE POSITION IN MANUFACTURES
CONFIDENTIAL

PAGE 03

OTTAWA 05225 03 OF 06 262339Z

(WHICH COULD BE MITIGATED BY SHARP DEPRECIATION OF
CANADIAN DOLLAR AGAINST OTHER MAJOR CURRENCIES IN PAST
YEAR); (C) TRADE AGREEMENT WITH EEC WHICH ACCORDS PREFERENCE IN PRC MARKET TO EUROPEAN SUPPLIERS, AND (D)
RELUCTANCE OF CANADIAN FIRMS TO SHOULDER COSTS OF GAINING
FOOTHOLD IN MARKET WHICH MAY PRODUCE SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL
RETURNS ONLY IN LONG RUN. DURING BILATERAL TRADE CONSULTATIONS, CANADIAN SIDE PRESSES FOR TRADE EXPANSION, WHILE
CHINESE STRESS THAT INCREASED TECHNOLOGICAL COOPERATION
WILL HELP EXPAND MARKETS FOR CANADIAN MANUFACTURED
PRODUCTS.
12. DESPITE HUANG HUA'S TRANSFER FROM OTTAWA TO NEW YORK,
RELATIONS WITH CHINA AT UN HAVE BEEN LIMITED. CANADA
PLAYED PART IN PEKING'S ACCESSION TO UN SEAT; AFTER 1966
IT ABSTAINED ON ANNUAL ALBANIAN RESOLUTION WHICH WOULD
HAVE GIVEN CHINA SEAT TO PEKING, AND, BEGINNING IN 1970,
CANADA VOTED TO SEAT PRC ON GROUNDS THAT &quot;GOVERNMENT THAT
HAS RESPONSIBILITY FOR OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF CHINESE
PEOPLE MUST NOW TAKE ITS PROPER PLACE.&quot; HOWEVER, EXTAFF
SOURCE DESCRIBES CHINESE AS &quot;ALOOF&quot; IN MULTILATERAL
SETTINGS AND UNINTERESTED IN ANY ISSUES EXCEPT OCCASIONAL
ITEMS WHICH (1) CONCERN CHINA DIRECTLY, (2) OFFER
OPPORTUNITIES TO DEMONSTRATE SOLIDARITY WITH LDC'S, OR
(3) PROVIDE OCCASIONS FOR JABS AT SOVIETS. IN RECENT
MONTHS CANADIANS HAVE SOUGHT TO CONVEY CONCERN OVER
CAMBODIAN HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS THROUGH CHINESE WITH
MIXED RESULTS. CANADIANS BELIEVE THEIR APPROACH MAY HAVE
BEEN INSTRUMENTAL IN LEADING PRC TO CAUTION KAMPUCHEAN
REGIME ON INTERNATIONAL IMAGE PROBLEM ITS INTERNAL
POLICIES WERE CREATING. BUT, IN RECENT BILATERAL WITH
FOREIGN MINISTER JAMIESON, HUANG HUA RIPOSTED WITH HARSH
LECTURE THAT WEST HAD LOST--THROUGH VIETNAM ADVENTURE--ANY

HUANG HUA CHOSE OTTAWA FOR HIS FIRST VISIT ABROAD IN
OCTOBER 1977 (77 OTTAWA 9085; 77 USNATO 10078). (HUA,
WHO EVIDENTLY RECALLS HIS DAYS AS AMBASSADOR TO CANADA
WITH SPECIAL WARMTH, REPORTEDLY LINGERED NOTICEABLY WITH
CANADIAN AMBASSADOR AT RECEPTION DURING HIS RECENT ROMANIAN
TRIP, REMARKING LATER THAT &quot;CANADA IS A GREAT COUNTRY&quot;.)
THERE ALSO HAS BEEN PRESS SPECULATION THAT CANADIAN VISIT
BY CHAIRMAN HUA KUO FENG IS LIKELY EARLY NEXT YEAR, BUT
EXTAFF AND CHINESE EMBASSY SAY THIS IS UNLIKELY.
15. HUA'S VISIT HAS BEEN FOLLOWED BY WHAT ONE EXTAFF
OFFICIAL TERMS A &quot;FLOOD&quot; OF CHINESE DELEGATIONS. SOME
HAVE BEEN HIGHLY VISIBLE BUT WITH LIMITED SUBSTANTIVE
IMPORT, SUCH AS TWENTY-NINE MAN PRC MISSION LED BY VICE
CHAIRMAN AND SECGEN OF NATIONAL PEOPLE'S CONGRESS CHI
PENG FEI, WHICH VISITED CANADA IN JUNE 1978. OF MORE
SIGNIFICANCE MAY BE STREAM OF CHINESE EXPERTS WHO HAVE
BEEN QUIETLY SCOURING CANADA FOR WESTERN TECHNOLOGY.
RECENT EXAMPLE IS AGRICULTURAL DELEGATION HEADED BY PRC
VICE-MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE WHICH VISITED PRAIRIE
PROVINCES FOR FOUR WEEKS IN AUGUST-SEPTEMBER TO STUDY
LAND RECLAMATION, MECHANIZATION AND AMBITIOUS RANGE OF
OTHER AGRICULTURAL TOPICS. CHINESE VICE-MINISTER OF
EDUCATION IS CURRENTLY IN OTTAWA TO LOOK INTO AUDIOVISUAL EQUIPMENT. OFFICIALS IN EXTAFF'S NORTHEAST ASIAN
DIVISION REGARD SUCH TRIPS AS EVIDENCE OF CONCENTRATED
CHINESE EFFORT TO ABSORB WESTERN KNOWHOW IN SPONGELIKE
FASHION FOR SYSTEMATIC APPLICATION IN CHINA. THEY

CONSIDER IT NOTEWORTHY THAT CHINESE HAVE SHED PREVIOUS
RETICENCE ON ACCEPTING FOREIGN AID, AND NOW HAVE NO
QUALMS ABOUT SEEKING CONCESSIONAL TERMS IN BEST LDC
TRADITION.
16. CANADIANS THUS SEE CHINESE INITIATIVE (OTTAWA 4745
AND 4031) TO TRAIN AS MANY AS 10,000 STUDENTS IN WEST
(INCLUDING 500 IN CANADA) AS LOGICAL EXTENSION OF SPONGE
PHENOMENON THEY HAVE BEEN OBSERVING IN RECENT MONTHS IN
OTHER AREAS OF RELATIONSHIP. OFFICIALS HERE WERE
GENERALLY PLEASED WITH CONDUCT OF CHINESE STUDYING IN
CANADA UNDER EARLIER, SMALL-SCALE EXCHANGE PROGRAM, AND
THEY WELCOMED NEW PROPOSAL AS OPPORTUNITY TO GENERATE
GOODWILL TRANSFERABLE TO OTHER AREAS OF BILATERAL
RELATIONSHIP. HOWEVER, CANADIANS ARE DETERMINED THAT
CHINESE WILL PAY EVERY PENNY OF PROGRAM'S COST (AND ARE
WAITING WITH INTEREST TO SEE IF PEKING AGREES).
17. IN MEANTIME, CHINESE TRIPS BY CANADIAN DIGNITARIES
(WHICH HAVE BY NO MEANS ABATED) HAVE ALSO PRODUCED

WERE STRUCK BY UPBEAT TONE OF TRADE TALKS AND GENERAL
CHINESE OPENNESS IN DISCUSSIONS. WITH FLAIR FOR

EXTAFF OFFICIALS INDICATE THERE ARE NO RPT NO &quot;SERIOUS

NO TRANSFER COULD EVER BE AGREED UPON IN ANY CASE, GIVEN
CANADA'S FIRM COMMITMENT TO SAFEGUARDS AGREEMENT AND
CHINA'S APPARENTLY EQUALLY ADAMANT OPPOSITION TO
LIMITATIONS.
21. RECENT SURGE IN BILATERAL ACTIVITY, COMBINED WITH
CANADA'S HISTORICAL FASCINATION WITH CHINA, WINS PROMINENT
MEDIA PLACING FOR CHINESE ITEMS. LAST WINTER'S TORONTO

ARTICLES, TV DOCUMENTARIES AND OTHER COVERAGE. ONE
JOURNALIST SUSTAINED DAILY COLUMN FOR TWO WEEKS ON VISIT

REPRESENTATIVES. IN FACT, ALTHOUGH CANADIANS ARE
CONSIDERABLY MORE PREOCCUPIED THESE DAYS WITH DOMESTIC
PROBLEMS THAN THEY ARE WITH THE OUTSIDE WORLD, COLUMN
INCHES DEVOTED TO CHINA IN RECENT MONTHS HAVE ECLIPSED
THOSE ON ALL OTHER COUNTRIES EXCEPTING U.S.
22. ONE UPSHOT OF CURRENT DECISIVE CHINESE THRUST
INTO OUTSIDE WORLD IS THAT CANADIAN OFFICIALS FEEL THEY
CAN NO LONGER LAY CLAIM TO BEST RELATIONSHIP WITH PRC
OF ANY WESTERN COUNTRY. THEY RECOGNIZE HIGHER IMPORTANCE
FOR CHINA WHICH RELATIONS WITH EEC, JAPAN AND,POTENTIALLY,
U.S. HOLD. IN CONVERSATION WITH EMBOFF, ONE EXTAFF
OFFICIAL WONDERED ALOUD IF MORE DELIBERATE, THOUGHTFULLY
COORDINATED WESTERN RESPONSE MIGHT NOT BE CALLED FOR
