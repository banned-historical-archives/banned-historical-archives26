		<h3>Tor</h3>
		<p><a href="https://www.torproject.org">Tor</a> is an encrypted anonymising network that makes it harder to intercept internet communications, or see where communications are coming from or going to.</p>
		<p>In order to use the WikiLeaks public submission system as detailed above you can download the Tor Browser Bundle, which is a Firefox-like browser available for Windows, Mac OS X and GNU/Linux and pre-configured to connect using the anonymising system Tor.</p>
		<h4>Tails</h4>
		<p>If you are at high risk and you have the capacity to do so, you can also access the submission system through a secure operating system called <a href="https://tails.boum.org">Tails</a>. Tails is an operating system launched from a USB stick or a DVD that aim to leaves no traces when the computer is shut down after use and automatically routes your internet traffic through Tor. Tails will require you to have either a USB stick or a DVD at least 4GB big and a laptop or desktop computer.</p>

		<h3>Tips</h3>
		<p>Our submission system works hard to preserve your anonymity, but we recommend you also take some of your own precautions. Please review these basic guidelines. </p>
		<div>
			<h4>1. Contact us if you have specific problems</h4>
			<p>If you have a very large submission, or a submission with a complex format, or are a high-risk source, please <a href="#submit_help_contact">contact us</a>. In our experience it is always possible to find a custom solution for even the most seemingly difficult situations.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h4>2. What computer to use</h4>
			<p>If the computer you are uploading from could subsequently be audited in an investigation, consider using a computer that is not easily tied to you. Technical users can also use <a href="https://tails.boum.org">Tails</a> to help ensure you do not leave any records of your submission on the computer.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h4>3. Do not talk about your submission to others</h4>
			<p>If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in source protection – it is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This includes other media organisations.</p>
		</div>

	</div>
</div>

<div id="submit_help_after" class="submit_elem">

			</div>
		</div>

		<h3>After</h3>

		<div>
			<h4>1. Do not talk about your submission to others</h4>
			<p>If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in source protection – it is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This includes other media organisations.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h4>2. Act normal</h4>
			<p>If you are a high-risk source, avoid saying anything or doing anything after submitting which might promote suspicion. In particular, you should try to stick to your normal routine and behaviour.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h4>3. Remove traces of your submission</h4>
			<p>If you are a high-risk source and the computer you prepared your submission on, or uploaded it from, could subsequently be audited in an investigation, we recommend that you format and dispose of the computer hard drive and any other storage media you used.</p>
			<p>In particular, hard drives retain data after formatting which may be visible to a digital forensics team and flash media (USB sticks, memory cards and SSD drives) retain data even after a secure erasure. If you used flash media to store sensitive data, it is important to destroy the media.</p>
			<p>If you do this and are a high-risk source you should make sure there are no traces of the clean-up, since such traces themselves may draw suspicion.</p>
			<div>
				<h4>4. If you face legal action</h4>
				<p>If a legal action is brought against you as a result of your submission, there are organisations that may help you. The Courage Foundation is an international organisation dedicated to the protection of journalistic sources. You can find more details at <a href="https://www.couragefound.org">https://www.couragefound.org</a>.</p>

		<p>WikiLeaks publishes documents of political or historical importance that are censored or otherwise suppressed. We specialise in strategic global publishing and large archives.</p>
		<p>The following is the address of our secure site where you can anonymously upload your documents to WikiLeaks editors. You can only access this submissions system through Tor. (See our <a href="#submit_help_tor">Tor tab</a> for more information.) We also advise you to read our <a href="#submit_help_tips">tips for sources</a> before submitting.</p>

   Title: China's Technology Showcases Mask Economic Warning Signs<br />
<br />
   Teaser: Beijing's drive to show off technological advances serves to<br />
   distract domestic and global audiences from the possibility of forthcoming<br />
   economic troubles.<br />
<br />
   Quote: Perhaps rather than what these showcase projects mean for China,<br />
   the greater question is what is driving Beijing to pursue so many of them.<br />
<br />
   China is once again on the verge of sending its first aircraft carrier to<br />
   sea. In recent days, the Chinese media has expanded on comments, made<br />
   during a Defense Ministry press conference, stating clearly and openly<br />
   confirming that China is in fact refitting its old Varyag and preparing to<br />
   enter the small club of carrier-floating nations. CONFIRMING OKAY? JUST<br />
   TRYING TO SAY IT AS SUCCINCTLY AS POSSIBLE.<br />
<br />
   That China has been China's outfitting of the never-completed Varyag (or<br />
   more accurately fitting, as it bought an unfinished ship in the first<br />
   place) has been one of the worst-kept secrets in military history. Hiding<br />
   something as large as an aircraft carrier, after all, is hard in this age<br />
   of cameras and satellite imaging. Its hard, after all, to hide something<br />
   as large as an aircraft carrier in this modern age of cameras and<br />
   satellites. And Chinese netziens?? NETZINES? SO, WEBSITES? have been even<br />
   more active than foreign observers at updating photos of the Varyag at<br />
   various stages in its fitting out, postulating the timing of deployment,<br />
   the christening name, and the significance meaning of Chinaa**s soon-to-be<br />
   newest ship in the Navy.<br />
<br />
    <br />
<br />
   Even as Chinese officials consistently pretended the country was not<br />
   preparing working on the Varyag for active use, Beijing knew that its PR<br />
   stance only added to the mystique of Chinaa**s naval development.<br />
<br />
   Chinese officials know that their official denials of the Varyag's<br />
   preparation for active use only add to the mystique of China's naval<br />
   development. Open a Newspapers and defense journals almost anywhere all<br />
   along the Pacific rim, or even beyond, and there is are replete with<br />
   foreign speculation on the future activities of a more internationally<br />
   active, and even aggressive, Chinese navy. Nevermind To say nothing of<br />
   more sober discussions of the significant constraints and limitations<br />
   facing potential Chinese naval ambitions with a single carrier (for now)<br />
   and no history or culture of carrier operations.<br />
<br />
    <br />
<br />
   And even as Beijing appears to Beijing plays down the Varyag's<br />
   significance or threat of the Varyag, by emphasizing that even after sea<br />
   trials it will take two to five years to fully outfit the carrier and make<br />
   it ready prepare it for active service, and that the Varyag is intended<br />
   more for training and learning than for any aggressive or even defensive<br />
   military use. But the more China plays down the carrier, the more foreign<br />
   voices claim Beijing is just trying to hiding its real and aggressive<br />
   agenda: to push the United States back out of Asian waters and dominate<br />
   the region.<br />
<br />
    <br />
<br />
   The attention on the Varyag is, in many ways, misplaced. China is<br />
   historically a land power. and Its biggest security challenges remain at<br />
   home, across a vast territory that will continue to require large<br />
   expenditures for manpower, equipment and transportation. Chinaa**s<br />
   historical flirtation with a navy that travels much far beyond its<br />
   immediate neighborhood has been limited. and Even the famous voyages of<br />
   Zheng He were more closer to a frivolity of opportunity than a serious<br />
   attempt to dominate seas around the world or even the region. regional<br />
   seas.<br />
<br />
   NOT SURE WHAT A &quot;FRIVOLITY OF OPPORTUNITY&quot; IS. IF SIMPLY &quot;FRIVOLITY&quot;<br />
   DOESN'T WORK, CAN YOU EXPLAIN WHAT YOU MEAN BY IT?<br />
<br />
   With the entrance of European navies into Asia, China found itself sorely<br />
   lacking any real defensive maritime capability. but Unlike neighboring<br />
   Japan, Chinaa**s attempts to build up a navy to counter European influence<br />
   proved ineffective, and the emergent Japanese navy defeated the Chinese<br />
   fleet. In the long run, however, once Japan launched its invasion of<br />
   China, it was doomed. Chinaa**s population size made it nigh nearly<br />
   impossible for a foreign maritime power to truly conquer.<br />
<br />
    <br />
<br />
   This is the core strength of China -- its geography and population provide<br />
   its best defense. China's extensive geography and high population are its<br />
   core strength and greatest defense. Even if an invasion from the sea is<br />
   initially successful, China has the human resources to ultimately either<br />
   absorb the conqueror  (the one land power that was successful in invading<br />
   China a** the Mongols a** eventually became subsumed into Chinese<br />
   culture), or to outlast the invader through a long war of attrition.<br />
   STRATFOR has said discussed in the past that one of the reasons China<br />
   appears bent on expanding of an expansion of its naval capabilities<br />
   relates to its shifting economic structure. The economic opening and<br />
   reform instituted by Deng Xiaoping led to a China that is much more<br />
   dependent upon increased China's dependence on imported foreign-sourced<br />
   raw materials and foreign markets. Chinaa**s economic supply lines now<br />
   traverse cross the globe. and Beijing perceives the potential for a<br />
   dominant naval power, namely the United States, to interrupt those lines,<br />
   or even to blockade Chinese ports in case of confrontation. blockade<br />
   Chinese ports.<br />
<br />
    <br />
<br />
   Chinaa**s naval expansion, in that case, is not part of a strategy to<br />
   engage in a naval arms race with the United States or even challenge U.S.<br />
   dominance of the seas. but Rather, Beijing intends to build a defensive<br />
   buffer around the Chinese China's maritime periphery. that This would give<br />
   Beijing the ability, in times of crisis the event of a confrontation with<br />
   the United States, to continue carrying out trade, at least with the<br />
   countries bordering the South China Sea. This in part also explains<br />
   Chinaa**s so-called two-island chain strategy, and its increasing<br />
   attention focus on disputed offshore territories, like the Spratly<br />
   Islands.<br />
<br />
    <br />
<br />
   But the attention to paid Chinaa**s new aircraft carrier, and to Chinaa**s<br />
   new deep-diving submarine, and to Chinaa**s its space exploration, and to<br />
   numerous other similar activities, also helps Beijing as a distraction for<br />
   its own populace and global attention away distract audiences domestic and<br />
   global from some very real problems inside the country. Chinaa**s ability<br />
   to refit and sail an aircraft carrier originally built back built when the<br />
   Soviet Union was still around and based on outdated technology from a<br />
   generation earlier is similar to reminds of Chinaa**s first manned space<br />
   launch a few years ago, which showed effectively that Chinese showcase<br />
   technology had entered the 1960s. These projects are costly and focus only<br />
   on address the periphery of China's strategic needs, but they attract a<br />
   lot of attention. Overseas, they somehow reinforce the perception of a<br />
   rising China -- and a rising China cannot be on the verge of a major<br />
   economic and social crisis. Domestically, they are intended to inspire the<br />
   population -- to attempt to create a sense of unity, and sacrifice and<br />
   nationalism to rally behind befitting an emerging global power.<br />
<br />
    <br />
<br />
   Like the Three Gorges Dam, this is a show of China's capabilities for<br />
   China is briefly impressive and attention-grabbing is impressive for a<br />
   moment, but doesna**t really address the core needs. And as has been seen<br />
   with Chinaa**s high-speed rail accident illustrated, the rush to highlight<br />
   advancements in Chinese technologies sometimes outpaces the quality of the<br />
   technological leap. THIS REWRITE OKAY? such leaps in Chinese showcase<br />
   technologies are not always perfected in the rush to highlight<br />
   advancement. Perhaps attention should be placed less on what these<br />
   emerging showcase projects may mean for China than<br />
<br />
   Perhaps rather than what these showcase projects mean for China, the<br />
   greater question what is driving Beijing to pursue so many of them. at<br />
   this time. Beijinga**s top concern is avoiding a domestic economic and<br />
   social crisis, and Chinese leaders know that it may be only a matter of<br />
   time before the Chinese economy may soon face the same structural<br />
   limitations that have hurt its East Asian counterparts in the past.<br />
   already faced. In fact,<br />
<br />
   The crisis may already be unfolding in China, as three decades of high<br />
   growth rates give way to more moderate growth and inefficiencies within<br />
   the economy become more apparent. within the Chinese economic system.<br />
   Sailing an aircraft carrier in circles off the coast of China may be<br />
   exciting and make for great video and dire  breathless speculations of<br />
   Chinaa**s emerging power. But the real show is playing out at home.<br />
   Stresses among the small businesses and the migrant laborers, the stresses<br />
   between the economic needs of the central planners and those of local and<br />
   regional governments, and portend the looming question: of What happens if<br />
   Chinaa**s economic miracle faces what all economic miracles eventually<br />
   face a** the reality that there is no such thing as unlimited linear<br />
   multi-digit growth.  <br />
