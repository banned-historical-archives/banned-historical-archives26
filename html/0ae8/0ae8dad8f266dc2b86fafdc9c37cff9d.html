		<h3>Tor</h3>
		<p><a href="https://www.torproject.org">Tor</a> is an encrypted anonymising network that makes it harder to intercept internet communications, or see where communications are coming from or going to.</p>
		<p>In order to use the WikiLeaks public submission system as detailed above you can download the Tor Browser Bundle, which is a Firefox-like browser available for Windows, Mac OS X and GNU/Linux and pre-configured to connect using the anonymising system Tor.</p>
		<h4>Tails</h4>
		<p>If you are at high risk and you have the capacity to do so, you can also access the submission system through a secure operating system called <a href="https://tails.boum.org">Tails</a>. Tails is an operating system launched from a USB stick or a DVD that aim to leaves no traces when the computer is shut down after use and automatically routes your internet traffic through Tor. Tails will require you to have either a USB stick or a DVD at least 4GB big and a laptop or desktop computer.</p>

		<h3>Tips</h3>
		<p>Our submission system works hard to preserve your anonymity, but we recommend you also take some of your own precautions. Please review these basic guidelines. </p>
		<div>
			<h4>1. Contact us if you have specific problems</h4>
			<p>If you have a very large submission, or a submission with a complex format, or are a high-risk source, please <a href="#submit_help_contact">contact us</a>. In our experience it is always possible to find a custom solution for even the most seemingly difficult situations.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h4>2. What computer to use</h4>
			<p>If the computer you are uploading from could subsequently be audited in an investigation, consider using a computer that is not easily tied to you. Technical users can also use <a href="https://tails.boum.org">Tails</a> to help ensure you do not leave any records of your submission on the computer.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h4>3. Do not talk about your submission to others</h4>
			<p>If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in source protection – it is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This includes other media organisations.</p>
		</div>

	</div>

		<h3>After</h3>

		<div>
			<h4>1. Do not talk about your submission to others</h4>
			<p>If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in source protection – it is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This includes other media organisations.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h4>2. Act normal</h4>
			<p>If you are a high-risk source, avoid saying anything or doing anything after submitting which might promote suspicion. In particular, you should try to stick to your normal routine and behaviour.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h4>3. Remove traces of your submission</h4>
			<p>If you are a high-risk source and the computer you prepared your submission on, or uploaded it from, could subsequently be audited in an investigation, we recommend that you format and dispose of the computer hard drive and any other storage media you used.</p>
			<p>In particular, hard drives retain data after formatting which may be visible to a digital forensics team and flash media (USB sticks, memory cards and SSD drives) retain data even after a secure erasure. If you used flash media to store sensitive data, it is important to destroy the media.</p>
			<p>If you do this and are a high-risk source you should make sure there are no traces of the clean-up, since such traces themselves may draw suspicion.</p>
			<div>
				<h4>4. If you face legal action</h4>
				<p>If a legal action is brought against you as a result of your submission, there are organisations that may help you. The Courage Foundation is an international organisation dedicated to the protection of journalistic sources. You can find more details at <a href="https://www.couragefound.org">https://www.couragefound.org</a>.</p>

		<p>WikiLeaks publishes documents of political or historical importance that are censored or otherwise suppressed. We specialise in strategic global publishing and large archives.</p>
		<p>The following is the address of our secure site where you can anonymously upload your documents to WikiLeaks editors. You can only access this submissions system through Tor. (See our <a href="#submit_help_tor">Tor tab</a> for more information.) We also advise you to read our <a href="#submit_help_tips">tips for sources</a> before submitting.</p>

			<!--<div>
				Copy this address into your Tor browser. Advanced users, if they wish, can also add a further layer of encryption to their submission using <a href="#submit_wlkey">our public PGP key</a>.
			</div>-->
		</div>

		<p>If you cannot use Tor, or your submission is very large, or you have specific requirements, WikiLeaks provides several alternative methods. <a href="#submit_help_contact">Contact us</a> to discuss how to proceed.</p>

THE LAST MINUTE IN OCTOBER 1978 BECAUSE OF MEDICAL
ADVICE. THE MUTUALLY CONVENIENT DATES FOR THE VISIT
HAD BEEN FIXED OVER SIX WEEKS AGO. THE HOUSE WILL
RECALL THAT I HAD MADE CLEAR THAT I WAS ACCEPTING
THE INVITATION OF FOREIGN MINISTER HUANG HUA TO
VISIT CHINA IN THE SPIRIT OF ADHERENCE TO OUR
GOVERNMENTS POLICY OF NON ALIGNMENT AND TO EXPLORE

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
THE POSSIBILITIES OF IMPROVING BILATERAL RELATIONS
WITH ALL COUNTRIES WITHOUT JEOPARDISING WELLESTABLISHED FRIENDSHIPS. MY VISIT AND MY CONVERSATIONS
WERE ENTIRELY IN KEEPING WITH THIS DECLARED POLICY
AND OBJECTIVE. WHILE EXCHANGE OF VIEWS ON INTERNATIONAL
ISSUES WERE ALWAYS INTENDED TO FIGURE IN THE
DISCUSSIONS, THE PRIMARYFOCUS OF MY VISIT WAS ON THE
DIFFICULT AND COMPLEX QUESTIONS WHICH BESET RELATIONS
BETWEEN INDIA AND CHINA.
OUR FOREIGN POLICY AND ITS ENDEAVOURS AND SUCCESSES
IN PROMOTING POSITIVE IMPROVEMENTS IN BILATERAL RELATIONS
AND INDIAS NATIONAL STRENGTH GAVE ME A MEASURE OF
CONFIDENCE IN MY MISSION. MY ANTICIPATION THAT
THESE RESUMED MINISTERIAL LEVEL BILATERAL CONTACTS
AT THIS TIME MIGHT PROVE WORTHWHILE IN SECURING
A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF EACH OTHER'S VIEWPOINT,
HAS BEEN BORNE OUT FROM MY VISIT.
IT WAS MY FIRST VISIT TO CHINA. FROM MY BRIEF
STAY IN SHANGHAI AND HANGCHOW I GOT VIVID
IMPRESSIONS OF THE VERY STRONG CULTURAL AND HISTORICAL
LINKS BETWEEN OUR TWO LARGE AND ANCIENT ASIAN COUNTRIES
AND THE SIMILAR PROBLEMS CONFRONTING THEM. THE TEMPLE
IN HANGCHOW WHICH I VISITED IS A BEAUTIFUL HISTORICAL
MONUMENT TO THE MESSAGE OF THE BUDDHA WHICH WENT FROM

INDIA TO CHINA. IN SHANGHAI I GOT SOME IDEA OF THE
ACHIEVEMENTS OF CHINA AS WELL AS THE SIMILARITIES OF
OUR DEVELOPMENTAL PROBLEMS.
OF PRIMARY, IMPORTANCE HOWEVER WERE THE CONVERSATIONS
WHICH I HAD WITH THE CHINESE LEADERSHIP IN
PEKING. THE THREE SESSIONS OF TALKS I HAD WITH FOREIGN
MINISTER HUANG HUA AND A LONG CONVERSATION WITH VICE
PREMIER TENG HSIAO-PING AND FINALLY THE MEETING WITH
PREMIER HUA KUO-FENG WERE ALL CHARACTERISED BY AN
ATMOSPHERE OF CORDIALITY. THE DISCUSSIONS WERE WIDE-RANGING
IN CONTENT AND BOTH SIDES WERE FRANK IN THE PRESENTATIONS
OF THEIR RESPECTIVE VIEWPOINTS. IN THESE TALKS, ALL
MAJOR ISSUES OF COMMON CONCERN TO THE TWO COUNTRIES
WERE COVERED. IN DEALING WITH THE INTERNATIONAL
POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC SCENE, WE FOCUSSED ON PROBLEMS
IN ASIA, AFRICA AND EUROPE AND EXCHANGED RESPECTIVE
ASSESSMENTS ON THE PROSPECTS OF WAR AND THE DIFFICULTIES
WHICH CAST THEIR SHADOW ON WORLD PEACE AND STABILITY.
WE DISCUSSED IN DETAIL THE SITUATION IN AND AROUND THE
INDIAN SUB-CONTINENT AND MOST IMPORTANT, THE ISSUES
AFFECTING INDI-CHINA BILATERAL RELATIONS.

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014

BOTH SIDES AGREED ON A FEW ISSUES SUCH AS THE
VITAL IMPORTANCE OF SUPPORTING THE STRUGGLE FOR
LIBERATION IN SOUTHERN AFRICA AND THE NEED FOR A
COMPREHENSIVE SETTLEMENT IN WEST ASIA WHICH
MUST INCLUDE THE FULFILLMENT OF PALESTINIAN RIGHTS. WE
AGREED THAT FOR THE PROGRESS OF THE DEVELOPING COUNTRIES,
IT WAS NECESSARY TO CREATE AN INTERNATIONAL
ENVIRONMENT OF PEACE AND TRANQUILITY. HOWEVER, BOTH SIDES
CLEARLY RECOGNISED THAT WE HAD DIFFERING ASSESSMENTS
ON THE INEVITABILITY OF WAR, THE LOGIC OF DISARMAMENT
AND THE PROSPECTS OF DETENTE. I NATURALLY AFFIRMED
OUR WELL KNOWN POSITIONS ON SUCH SUBJECTS.

CINCPAC FOR POLAD
I EXPLAINED IN DETAIL HOW, IN KEEPING WITH INDIA'S
TRADITIONAL AND CONTINUING POLICY OF NON ALIGNMENT,
OUR GOVERNMENT HAD MADE STRENUOUS EFFORTS AND, WITH
GRATIFYING SUCCESS, IN PRESERVING WELL-ESTABLISHED
FRIENDSHIPS AND AT THE SAME TIME IN IMPROVING RELATIONS
WITH OTHERS. I EXPLAINED THAT IN OUR VIEW, THE WORLD
ORDER WITH ITS ENLARGED MEMBERSHIP OF NATION STATES,
MUST BE MADE SAFER AND STABLER SO THAT INDEPENDENT
NATIONS MAY BE ABLE TO EXERCISE THEIR RIGHT TO PROGRESS

IN THEIR OWN WAY. A NEW ECONOMIC ORDER MUST BE
FASHIONED WHICH WOULD CORRECT THE DANGEROUS
IMBALANCESOIHICH HAVE DEVELOPED AND MADE MORE JUST
SO THAT IMPEDIMENTS FACED, NOTABLY BY THE DEVELOPING
WORLD, ARE REMOVED AND INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC
RELATIONS ARE RE-STRUCTURED.
ON THE SUBJECT OF THE SITUATION IN THE SUBCONTINENT WHICH WAS DISCUSSED AT CONSIDERABLE LENGTH,
I EXPLAINED THAT WITH FULL DEFERENCE TO THE INDEPENDENCE
OF OUR NEIGHBOURS, WE HAVE SOUGHT ASSIDUOUSLY
TO RESOLVE OUTSTANDING PROBLEMS. I SPOKE OF OUR
ATTEMPTS TO CREATE A CLIMATE OF CONFIDENCE BETWEEN
THE NATIONS SOUTH OF THE HIMALAYAS, WHICH ON THE
ONE HAND, WOULD LEAD TO AN OPTIMISATION OF OUR
RESPECTIVE NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND COOPERATION BETWEEN
NEIGHBOURS AND, ON THE OTHER, COULD REDUCE AND,
HOPEFULLY, END, THE LONG STORY OF GREAT POWER
INVOLVEMENT AND COMPETITION IN THE PROBLEMS OF OUR REGION.
A STABLE AND COOPERATIVE SOUTH ASIA, I URGED, CAN
BE AN EXAMPLE AND AN ASSET TO THE WORLD.
AGAINST THIS BACKGROUND I DESCRIBED IN DETAIL
OUR STRICT AND SCRUPULOUS POLICY OF NON-INTERFERENCE
IN INTERNAL PROBLEMS AND THE STEPS TAKEN TO IMPROVE
RELATIONS WITH PAKISTAN. EVEN WHILE WE DO NOT OBJECT
TO NORMAL BILATERAL RELATIONS BETWEEN PAKISTAN AND
CHINA, THE PROSPECT OF IMPROVEMENT OF INDIA-CHINA
RELATIONS WOULD BE IMPEDED IF THEIR RELATIONS
ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR LEGITIMATE INTERESTS.
IN THIS CONTEXT, I SUMMARISED THE ORIGIN AND THE
LONG HISTORY OF OUR DIFFERENCES WITH PAKISTAN ON THE

QUESTION OF JAMMU AND KASHMIR. I INFORMED THE CHINESE
LEADERS THAT UNDER THE SIMLA AGREEMENT, TO WHICH BOTH
COUNTRIES ARE PARTIES, WE ARE COMMITTED TO THE FINAL
SETTLEMENT OF THE KASHMIR QUESTION THROUGH BILATERAL
DISCUSSIONS. IT HAS BEEN THE CONSIDERED VIEW OF THE
GOVERNMENT AND ALL SECTIONS OF THE PEOPLE IN INDIA,
THAT UNLIKE THE STAND TAKEN BY CHINESE IN THE
FIFTIES, THE ATTITUDE ADOPTED BY THE PEOPLES
REPUBLIC OF CHINA IN THE LAST DECADE AND A HALF HAD
BEEN AN ADDITIONAL AND UNNECESSARY COMPLICATION TO THE
PROSPECTS OF SINO-INDIAN RELATIONS. IN THIS CONNECTION,
I ALSO REITERATED OUR CONCERN AT THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE
KARAKORAM HIGHWAY ACROSS TERRITORY WHICH FORMED PART
OF THE STATE OF JAMMU AND KASHMIR.
THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT SHOWED UNDERSTANDING OF OUR
POLICY TOWARDS PAKISTAN AND OUR NEIGHBOURS AND

MY CONVERSATIONS WITH THE CHINESE LEADERS ALSO
COVERED OTHER PAST IRRITANTS TO OUR RELATIONS. I
DREW ATTENTION TO THE FACT THAT REBELS OR DISAFFECTED
ELEMENTS FROM NAGALAND, MIZORAM AND MANIPUR WHO HAD
MANAGED TO REACH CHINA HAD RECEIVED MORAL AND

SUPPORT WHICH MAY HAVE BEEN GIVEN - THE LAST INSTANCE

RECOGNITION OF THE NEEDS OF THE TIBETAN REFUGEES,

WITH THE TIBET REGION EXPIRED IN 1962 AND HAS NOT
SINCE BEEN RENEWED. NEVERTHELESS, IT WAS OUR HOPE
THAT THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT WOULD CONSIDER FACILITATING PILGRIMAGES TO THESE HOLY PLACES. SHOULD
SUCH FACILITIES BE GRANTED, I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT THE

OBSERVE THAT INTERNATIONAL PROBLEMS AND SPECIFIC
QUESTIONS OF CONCERN TO THE TWO COUNTRIES FIGURED
SQUARELY IN OUR DISCUSSIONS. OUR RELATIONS WITH
OTHER COUNTRIES, WHICH DID NOT IN ANY WAY AFFECT OUR
RELATIONS WITH CHINA, DID NOT COME UP IN OUR

EXPRESSED THE HOPE THAT THEY WOULD BE RESOLVED
PEACEFULLY.
I MIGHT ADD IN THIS CONNECTION THAT THERE WAS
A DISCUSSION ON THE SITUATION IN INDO-CHINA, THE
CHINESE LEADERS EXPRESSED THEIR VIEW-POINT ON THE
DETERIORATION OF THEIR RELATIONS WITH VIETNAM.
I CLEARLY EXPRESSED THAT EACH OF THE COUNTRIES IN
THE REGION MUST BE ENABLED TO MAINTAN THEIR INDEPENDENCE AND WERE ENTITLED TO RESPECT FOR THEIR
SOVEREIGNITY AND TERRITORIAL INTEGRITY. THIS
REQUIRED ADHERENCE TO THE PRINCIPLE OF NON-INTERFERENCE. I CAUTIONED THAT THERE SHOULD BE NO

SAFEGUARD OUR INTERESTS IN OUR DIPLOMACY. IT IS NOT
TOO FAR-FETCHED TO BELIEVE THAT NEITHER CHINA NOR
INDIA CAN PROFIT FROM AN ATTITUDE OF HOSTILITY OR EVEN
DETACHMENT OF A KIND WHICH CHARACTERISED OUR RELATIONS
FOR MANY YEARS. I BELIEVE THERE IS A NEW RESPECT FOR
OUR POLICY OF GENUINE NON-ALIGNMENT AND INDEPENDENT
RATIONALE IN OUR JUDGEMENT ON INTERNATIONAL ISSUES

PAST AND ITS ACHIEVEMENT IN THE LAST 30 YEARS, AND
ITS POSITION IN THE WORLD. GIVEN MUTUAL RESPECT
BASED ON EQUALITY AND DIGNITY, INDIA-CHINA RELATIONS
CAN ALSO IMPROVE BILATERALLY AND FIT INTO THE WEB OF

AND I COME BACK SATISFIED WITH THE DECISION TO
UNDERTAKE THE MISSION.BUT, I ALSO KNOW IT WOULD BE
A LONG HAUL WHICH WILL DEMAND MATURITY AND RECIPROCAL
EFFORTS BY BOTH GOVERNMENTS IF, IN THE PATH AHEAD,
SATISFACTORY RESULTS ARE TO BE OBTAINED.
I MUST ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE OFFICIAL DELEGATION
AND THE LARGE PARTY OF JOURNALISTS WHO HAD DECIDED
AT THEIR OWN EXPENSE TO COVER THE VISIT WERE SHOWN
GREAT HOSPITALITY AND COURTESY. I HAVE EXTENDED
AN INVITATION TO FOREIGN MINISTER HUANG HUA TO
VISIT INDIA AT HIS CONVENIENCE TO ENABLE US TO
CONTINUE THE DIALOGUE. PREMIER HUA KUO-FENG
ASKED ME TO CONVEY AN INVITATION TO OUR PRIME

I WENT TO CHINA WITH THE CONFIDENCE THAT I
HAD THE BROAD SUPPORT OF A NATIONAL CONSENSUS. I
KNOW FOR EVERY INDIAN, WHETHER IN GOVERNMENT OR
OUTSIDE, NATIONAL INTEREST AND HONOUR MUST BE
SUPREME. IVIVIDLY REMEMBER THAT IN THE LATE FIFTIES
AND EARLY SIXTIES, I GAVE EXPRESSION TO MY STRONG

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
THE POSSIBILITIES OF IMPROVING BILATERAL RELATIONS
WITH ALL COUNTRIES WITHOUT JEOPARDISING WELLESTABLISHED FRIENDSHIPS. MY VISIT AND MY CONVERSATIONS
WERE ENTIRELY IN KEEPING WITH THIS DECLARED POLICY
AND OBJECTIVE. WHILE EXCHANGE OF VIEWS ON INTERNATIONAL
ISSUES WERE ALWAYS INTENDED TO FIGURE IN THE
DISCUSSIONS, THE PRIMARYFOCUS OF MY VISIT WAS ON THE
DIFFICULT AND COMPLEX QUESTIONS WHICH BESET RELATIONS
BETWEEN INDIA AND CHINA.
OUR FOREIGN POLICY AND ITS ENDEAVOURS AND SUCCESSES
IN PROMOTING POSITIVE IMPROVEMENTS IN BILATERAL RELATIONS
AND INDIAS NATIONAL STRENGTH GAVE ME A MEASURE OF
CONFIDENCE IN MY MISSION. MY ANTICIPATION THAT
THESE RESUMED MINISTERIAL LEVEL BILATERAL CONTACTS
AT THIS TIME MIGHT PROVE WORTHWHILE IN SECURING
A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF EACH OTHER'S VIEWPOINT,
HAS BEEN BORNE OUT FROM MY VISIT.
IT WAS MY FIRST VISIT TO CHINA. FROM MY BRIEF
STAY IN SHANGHAI AND HANGCHOW I GOT VIVID
IMPRESSIONS OF THE VERY STRONG CULTURAL AND HISTORICAL
LINKS BETWEEN OUR TWO LARGE AND ANCIENT ASIAN COUNTRIES
AND THE SIMILAR PROBLEMS CONFRONTING THEM. THE TEMPLE
IN HANGCHOW WHICH I VISITED IS A BEAUTIFUL HISTORICAL
MONUMENT TO THE MESSAGE OF THE BUDDHA WHICH WENT FROM

INDIA TO CHINA. IN SHANGHAI I GOT SOME IDEA OF THE
ACHIEVEMENTS OF CHINA AS WELL AS THE SIMILARITIES OF
OUR DEVELOPMENTAL PROBLEMS.
OF PRIMARY, IMPORTANCE HOWEVER WERE THE CONVERSATIONS
WHICH I HAD WITH THE CHINESE LEADERSHIP IN
PEKING. THE THREE SESSIONS OF TALKS I HAD WITH FOREIGN
MINISTER HUANG HUA AND A LONG CONVERSATION WITH VICE
PREMIER TENG HSIAO-PING AND FINALLY THE MEETING WITH
PREMIER HUA KUO-FENG WERE ALL CHARACTERISED BY AN
ATMOSPHERE OF CORDIALITY. THE DISCUSSIONS WERE WIDE-RANGING
IN CONTENT AND BOTH SIDES WERE FRANK IN THE PRESENTATIONS
OF THEIR RESPECTIVE VIEWPOINTS. IN THESE TALKS, ALL
MAJOR ISSUES OF COMMON CONCERN TO THE TWO COUNTRIES
WERE COVERED. IN DEALING WITH THE INTERNATIONAL
POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC SCENE, WE FOCUSSED ON PROBLEMS
IN ASIA, AFRICA AND EUROPE AND EXCHANGED RESPECTIVE
ASSESSMENTS ON THE PROSPECTS OF WAR AND THE DIFFICULTIES
WHICH CAST THEIR SHADOW ON WORLD PEACE AND STABILITY.
WE DISCUSSED IN DETAIL THE SITUATION IN AND AROUND THE
INDIAN SUB-CONTINENT AND MOST IMPORTANT, THE ISSUES
AFFECTING INDI-CHINA BILATERAL RELATIONS.

BOTH SIDES AGREED ON A FEW ISSUES SUCH AS THE
VITAL IMPORTANCE OF SUPPORTING THE STRUGGLE FOR
LIBERATION IN SOUTHERN AFRICA AND THE NEED FOR A
COMPREHENSIVE SETTLEMENT IN WEST ASIA WHICH
MUST INCLUDE THE FULFILLMENT OF PALESTINIAN RIGHTS. WE
AGREED THAT FOR THE PROGRESS OF THE DEVELOPING COUNTRIES,
IT WAS NECESSARY TO CREATE AN INTERNATIONAL
ENVIRONMENT OF PEACE AND TRANQUILITY. HOWEVER, BOTH SIDES
CLEARLY RECOGNISED THAT WE HAD DIFFERING ASSESSMENTS
ON THE INEVITABILITY OF WAR, THE LOGIC OF DISARMAMENT
AND THE PROSPECTS OF DETENTE. I NATURALLY AFFIRMED

FASHIONED WHICH WOULD CORRECT THE DANGEROUS
IMBALANCESOIHICH HAVE DEVELOPED AND MADE MORE JUST
SO THAT IMPEDIMENTS FACED, NOTABLY BY THE DEVELOPING
WORLD, ARE REMOVED AND INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC
RELATIONS ARE RE-STRUCTURED.
ON THE SUBJECT OF THE SITUATION IN THE SUBCONTINENT WHICH WAS DISCUSSED AT CONSIDERABLE LENGTH,
I EXPLAINED THAT WITH FULL DEFERENCE TO THE INDEPENDENCE
OF OUR NEIGHBOURS, WE HAVE SOUGHT ASSIDUOUSLY
TO RESOLVE OUTSTANDING PROBLEMS. I SPOKE OF OUR
ATTEMPTS TO CREATE A CLIMATE OF CONFIDENCE BETWEEN
THE NATIONS SOUTH OF THE HIMALAYAS, WHICH ON THE
ONE HAND, WOULD LEAD TO AN OPTIMISATION OF OUR

INVOLVEMENT AND COMPETITION IN THE PROBLEMS OF OUR REGION.

RELATIONS WITH PAKISTAN. EVEN WHILE WE DO NOT OBJECT
TO NORMAL BILATERAL RELATIONS BETWEEN PAKISTAN AND

QUESTION OF JAMMU AND KASHMIR. I INFORMED THE CHINESE
LEADERS THAT UNDER THE SIMLA AGREEMENT, TO WHICH BOTH
COUNTRIES ARE PARTIES, WE ARE COMMITTED TO THE FINAL
SETTLEMENT OF THE KASHMIR QUESTION THROUGH BILATERAL
DISCUSSIONS. IT HAS BEEN THE CONSIDERED VIEW OF THE
GOVERNMENT AND ALL SECTIONS OF THE PEOPLE IN INDIA,
THAT UNLIKE THE STAND TAKEN BY CHINESE IN THE
FIFTIES, THE ATTITUDE ADOPTED BY THE PEOPLES
REPUBLIC OF CHINA IN THE LAST DECADE AND A HALF HAD
BEEN AN ADDITIONAL AND UNNECESSARY COMPLICATION TO THE
PROSPECTS OF SINO-INDIAN RELATIONS. IN THIS CONNECTION,
I ALSO REITERATED OUR CONCERN AT THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE
KARAKORAM HIGHWAY ACROSS TERRITORY WHICH FORMED PART
OF THE STATE OF JAMMU AND KASHMIR.
THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT SHOWED UNDERSTANDING OF OUR
POLICY TOWARDS PAKISTAN AND OUR NEIGHBOURS AND
EXPRESSED, BOTH IN PUBLIC AND IN OUR CONVERSATIONS,
APPRECIATION OF OUR EFFORTS, AND INDEED, THE RATIONALE
AND SUCCESS OF THE POLICY. THE CHINESE LEADERS NOTED

INDIA AND CHINA PERTAINING TO TRADE AND INTERCOUSE
WITH THE TIBET REGION EXPIRED IN 1962 AND HAS NOT
SINCE BEEN RENEWED. NEVERTHELESS, IT WAS OUR HOPE
THAT THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT WOULD CONSIDER FACILITATING PILGRIMAGES TO THESE HOLY PLACES. SHOULD
SUCH FACILITIES BE GRANTED, I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT THE
PEOPLE IN INDIA WOULD LOOK UPON IT AS SYMBOLIC OF

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
THE IMPROVED RELATIONS BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES.
WE, ON OUR PART, ARE READY TO CONSIDER SIMILAR
FACILITIES FOR PILGRIMAGE TO INDIA.
FROM THIS BRIEF ACCOUNT, HON. MEMBERS WILL
OBSERVE THAT INTERNATIONAL PROBLEMS AND SPECIFIC
QUESTIONS OF CONCERN TO THE TWO COUNTRIES FIGURED
SQUARELY IN OUR DISCUSSIONS. OUR RELATIONS WITH
OTHER COUNTRIES, WHICH DID NOT IN ANY WAY AFFECT OUR
RELATIONS WITH CHINA, DID NOT COME UP IN OUR
DISCUSSIONS. WHERE THERE WAS A REFERENCE TO DIFFERENCES BETWEEN GREAT POWERS AND AREAS OF TENSION, I
EXPRESSED THE HOPE THAT THEY WOULD BE RESOLVED
PEACEFULLY.
I MIGHT ADD IN THIS CONNECTION THAT THERE WAS
A DISCUSSION ON THE SITUATION IN INDO-CHINA, THE
CHINESE LEADERS EXPRESSED THEIR VIEW-POINT ON THE
DETERIORATION OF THEIR RELATIONS WITH VIETNAM.
I CLEARLY EXPRESSED THAT EACH OF THE COUNTRIES IN
THE REGION MUST BE ENABLED TO MAINTAN THEIR INDEPENDENCE AND WERE ENTITLED TO RESPECT FOR THEIR
SOVEREIGNITY AND TERRITORIAL INTEGRITY. THIS
REQUIRED ADHERENCE TO THE PRINCIPLE OF NON-INTERFERENCE. I CAUTIONED THAT THERE SHOULD BE NO
FURTHER DETERIORATION OF THE SITUATION. IT IS A
MATTER OF REGRET THAT IN THE COURSE OF OUR FRANK
EXCHANGES, WHERE WE CLEARLY RECOGNIZED THAT WE HAD

TRANQUILITY HAS EXISTED ALONG OUR BORDER AND THIS,
WE AGREED, IN ANY CASE, SHOULD BE MAINTAINED. FOLLOWING THE RESTORATION OF OUR DIPLOMATIC REPRESENTATION
TO AMBASSADORIAL LEVEL IN 1976, RESTRICTIONS ON TRADE,
BANKING AND SHIPPING HAD BEEN REMOVED AND FUNCTIONAL
CONTACTS AND EXCHANGES OF DELEGATIONS HAD ALREADY
STARTED. SINCE THE PRESENT GOVERNMENT ASSUMED
OFFICE, THIS PROCESS HAS CONTINUED AND THE SCOPE FOR
POSSIBLE BILATERAL FUNCTIONAL COOPERATION HAS BEEN
IDENTIFIED. THE CHINESE GOVT. ARE NOW EMBARKED ON
A GIGANTIC PROGRAMME OF MODERNISATION. THE CHINESE

LEADERSHIP HINTED THAT IN MANY FIELDS IT WOULD BE
OF RECIPROCAL ADVANTAGE FOR THE TWO COUNTRIES TO SHARE
EACH OTHER'S EXPERIENCE AND EXPERTISE. TRADE COULD
IMPROVE FURTHER AND SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNOLOGICAL KNOWHOW IN VARIOUS BRANCHES COULD BE EXCHANGED. IT
REMAINS FOR THE OFFICIALS AND EXPERTS OF THE TWO
SIDES TO STUDY MORE CLOSELY AND WORK OUT AREAS AND
FORMS OF ADVANTAGEOUS CO-OPERATION, WHERE
REAL BILATERAL COMPLEMENTARITY EXISTS.
MR. SPEAKER, WE HAVE NOT SLURRED OVER SET-BACKS
OF THE PAST OR THE OUTSTANDING PROBLEMS WHICH REMAIN.
INDIA AND CHINA HAVE DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES ON INTERNAL
AND EXTERNAL POLICIES. WE ARE CONFIDENT OF INDIA'S
STRENGTH AND NEED NOT BE DIFFIDENT OF OUR ABILITY TO

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
SAFEGUARD OUR INTERESTS IN OUR DIPLOMACY. IT IS NOT
TOO FAR-FETCHED TO BELIEVE THAT NEITHER CHINA NOR
INDIA CAN PROFIT FROM AN ATTITUDE OF HOSTILITY OR EVEN
DETACHMENT OF A KIND WHICH CHARACTERISED OUR RELATIONS
FOR MANY YEARS. I BELIEVE THERE IS A NEW RESPECT FOR
OUR POLICY OF GENUINE NON-ALIGNMENT AND INDEPENDENT
RATIONALE IN OUR JUDGEMENT ON INTERNATIONAL ISSUES
AND NOTABLY FOR OUR POLICY TOWARDS SOUTH ASIA AS WELL AS
ECONOMIC AND TECHNOLOGICAL PROGRESS OF INDIA.
WE, FOR OUR PART, CANNOT BUT EQUALLY RECOGNISE THE
IMPORTANCE OF THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC FOR ITS ANCIENT
PAST AND ITS ACHIEVEMENT IN THE LAST 30 YEARS, AND
ITS POSITION IN THE WORLD. GIVEN MUTUAL RESPECT
BASED ON EQUALITY AND DIGNITY, INDIA-CHINA RELATIONS
CAN ALSO IMPROVE BILATERALLY AND FIT INTO THE WEB OF
POSITIVELY ORIENTED AND ADVANTAGEOUS RELATIONSHIPS,
WHICH IS THE ESSENCE OF OUR FOREIGN POLICY. JUST AS I WOULD
CAUTION AGAINST EUPHOR8-, I WOULD ALSO URGE A MEASURE

NEW DE 02960 04 OF 04 220608Z

OF SELF-CONFIDENCE THAT ANY EFFORT AT IMPROVEMENT IN
RELATIONS NEED NOT MEAN THE SACRIFICE OF OUR NATIONAL
INTERESTS AND ASPIRATIONS. WE HAVE MADE A BEGINNING
AND I COME BACK SATISFIED WITH THE DECISION TO
UNDERTAKE THE MISSION.BUT, I ALSO KNOW IT WOULD BE
A LONG HAUL WHICH WILL DEMAND MATURITY AND RECIPROCAL
EFFORTS BY BOTH GOVERNMENTS IF, IN THE PATH AHEAD,
SATISFACTORY RESULTS ARE TO BE OBTAINED.
I MUST ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE OFFICIAL DELEGATION
AND THE LARGE PARTY OF JOURNALISTS WHO HAD DECIDED
AT THEIR OWN EXPENSE TO COVER THE VISIT WERE SHOWN
GREAT HOSPITALITY AND COURTESY. I HAVE EXTENDED
AN INVITATION TO FOREIGN MINISTER HUANG HUA TO
VISIT INDIA AT HIS CONVENIENCE TO ENABLE US TO
CONTINUE THE DIALOGUE. PREMIER HUA KUO-FENG
ASKED ME TO CONVEY AN INVITATION TO OUR PRIME
MINISTER TO VISIT CHINA AT A MUTUALLY CONVENIENT TIME
IN THE FUTURE.
I WENT TO CHINA WITH THE CONFIDENCE THAT I
HAD THE BROAD SUPPORT OF A NATIONAL CONSENSUS. I
KNOW FOR EVERY INDIAN, WHETHER IN GOVERNMENT OR
OUTSIDE, NATIONAL INTEREST AND HONOUR MUST BE
SUPREME. IVIVIDLY REMEMBER THAT IN THE LATE FIFTIES
AND EARLY SIXTIES, I GAVE EXPRESSION TO MY STRONG
FEELINGS WHEN THE HOPES OF INDIA-CHINA FRIENDSHIP
SUFFERED A SERIOUS SETBACK. WITH THE BURDEN OF
RESPONSIBILITIES I NOW CARRY,MY CONCERN FOR NATIONAL
INTEREST AND HONOR REMAINS THE SAME. ALL THOSE
