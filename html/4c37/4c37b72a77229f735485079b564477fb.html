		<h3>Tor</h3>
		<p><a href="https://www.torproject.org">Tor</a> is an encrypted anonymising network that makes it harder to intercept internet communications, or see where communications are coming from or going to.</p>
		<p>In order to use the WikiLeaks public submission system as detailed above you can download the Tor Browser Bundle, which is a Firefox-like browser available for Windows, Mac OS X and GNU/Linux and pre-configured to connect using the anonymising system Tor.</p>
		<h4>Tails</h4>
		<p>If you are at high risk and you have the capacity to do so, you can also access the submission system through a secure operating system called <a href="https://tails.boum.org">Tails</a>. Tails is an operating system launched from a USB stick or a DVD that aim to leaves no traces when the computer is shut down after use and automatically routes your internet traffic through Tor. Tails will require you to have either a USB stick or a DVD at least 4GB big and a laptop or desktop computer.</p>

		<h3>Tips</h3>
		<p>Our submission system works hard to preserve your anonymity, but we recommend you also take some of your own precautions. Please review these basic guidelines. </p>
		<div>
			<h4>1. Contact us if you have specific problems</h4>
			<p>If you have a very large submission, or a submission with a complex format, or are a high-risk source, please <a href="#submit_help_contact">contact us</a>. In our experience it is always possible to find a custom solution for even the most seemingly difficult situations.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h4>2. What computer to use</h4>
			<p>If the computer you are uploading from could subsequently be audited in an investigation, consider using a computer that is not easily tied to you. Technical users can also use <a href="https://tails.boum.org">Tails</a> to help ensure you do not leave any records of your submission on the computer.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h4>3. Do not talk about your submission to others</h4>
			<p>If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in source protection – it is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This includes other media organisations.</p>
		</div>

	</div>

		<h3>After</h3>

		<div>
			<h4>1. Do not talk about your submission to others</h4>
			<p>If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in source protection – it is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This includes other media organisations.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h4>2. Act normal</h4>
			<p>If you are a high-risk source, avoid saying anything or doing anything after submitting which might promote suspicion. In particular, you should try to stick to your normal routine and behaviour.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h4>3. Remove traces of your submission</h4>
			<p>If you are a high-risk source and the computer you prepared your submission on, or uploaded it from, could subsequently be audited in an investigation, we recommend that you format and dispose of the computer hard drive and any other storage media you used.</p>
			<p>In particular, hard drives retain data after formatting which may be visible to a digital forensics team and flash media (USB sticks, memory cards and SSD drives) retain data even after a secure erasure. If you used flash media to store sensitive data, it is important to destroy the media.</p>
			<p>If you do this and are a high-risk source you should make sure there are no traces of the clean-up, since such traces themselves may draw suspicion.</p>
			<div>
				<h4>4. If you face legal action</h4>
				<p>If a legal action is brought against you as a result of your submission, there are organisations that may help you. The Courage Foundation is an international organisation dedicated to the protection of journalistic sources. You can find more details at <a href="https://www.couragefound.org">https://www.couragefound.org</a>.</p>

		<p>WikiLeaks publishes documents of political or historical importance that are censored or otherwise suppressed. We specialise in strategic global publishing and large archives.</p>
		<p>The following is the address of our secure site where you can anonymously upload your documents to WikiLeaks editors. You can only access this submissions system through Tor. (See our <a href="#submit_help_tor">Tor tab</a> for more information.) We also advise you to read our <a href="#submit_help_tips">tips for sources</a> before submitting.</p>

			<!--<div>
				Copy this address into your Tor browser. Advanced users, if they wish, can also add a further layer of encryption to their submission using <a href="#submit_wlkey">our public PGP key</a>.
			</div>-->
		</div>

		<p>If you cannot use Tor, or your submission is very large, or you have specific requirements, WikiLeaks provides several alternative methods. <a href="#submit_help_contact">Contact us</a> to discuss how to proceed.</p>

SUBJ: REINFORCED NAC ON THE FAR EAST, OCTOBER 29, 1975</div><div class="text-button" id="showhide">Show&nbsp;Headers</div><div class="text-content"><div id="tagged-text">SUMMARY: NAC CONSULTATION ON FAR EAST ON OCTOBER 29 WAS
REINFORCED BY SENIOR POLICY OFFICIALS FROM BELGIUM, FRG,
ITALY, NETHERLANDS, UK AND US. ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF STATE
HABIB (US) LED OFF DISCUSSION, COVERING GENERAL EAST ASIAN
DEVELOPMENTS IN THE SIX MONTHS SINCE THE FALL OF SAIGON. HE
SAID THE INITIAL APPREHENSION FOLLOWING THE FALL OF SAIGON
HAD DISSIPATED. THE SOUTHEAST ASIAN COUNTRIES ARE STILL CON-
CERNED WITH THE IMPACT OF HANOI'S SUCCESS ON THEIR SECURITY;
THEY ARE MOVING CLOSER TO THE NON-ALIGNED BLOC AND BEGINNING
TO DEVELOP ASEAN INTO A MORE MEANINGFUL REGIONAL ORGANIZATION.
AT THE SAME TIME, THEY CONTINUE TO RELY UPON THE US COMMIT-
MENT, WHICH WE HAVE REAFFIRMED. PRC RELATIONS WITH THE US
AND JAPAN ARE RELATIVELY GOOD, WHILE THOSE WITH THE SOVIETS
ARE COOL. THE INTERNAL SCENE IN CHINA IS STABLE; THE LINES
OF SUCCESSION ARE SET WITH THE CURRENT LEADERSHIP DISPLAYING
A COLLEGIAL CHARACTER. JAPAN-US RELATIONS ARE THE BEST THEY
HAVE EVER BEEN. JAPAN IS CLOSER TO PEKING THAN TO MOSCOW.
CONFIDENTIAL

THE SITUATION ON THE KOREAN PENINSULA REMAINS CALM FOR THE
TIME BEING, BUT PRESENTS THE GREATEST DANGER FOR POTENTIAL
CONFRONTATION. HABIB'S PRESENTATION WAS FOLLOWED BY A WIDE-
RANGING DISCUSSION INVOLVING PERMREPS AND VISITING OFFICIALS
FROM CAPITALS.
THIS REINFORCED NAC ON THE FAR EAST WAS GREETED WITH
ENTHUSIASM BY PERMREPS. MENZIES (CANADA) WELCOMED THE CON-
SULTATIONS AS &quot;USEFUL AND TIMELY&quot; AND PARTICULARLY BECAUSE
OF PARTICIPATION BY HIGH-LEVEL OFFICIALS FROM CAPITALS.
SIMILAR APPRECIATION WAS EXPRESSED BY KRAPF (FRG). CATALANO
(ITALY) SAID THE SESSION WAS ONE OF THE BEST ALLIANCE CON-
SULTATIONS HE COULD REMEMBER AND THAT MEETINGS OF THIS SORT
SHOULD BE AMONG THE BEST TRADITIONS OF NATO. ACTING SECRETARY
GENERAL PANSA SUMMED UP THE MEETING, CALLING IT &quot;EXTREMELY
GOOD&quot;, PROVIDING EVIDENCE OF THE ALLIES PUTTING INTO PRACTICE
THEIR RESOLVE WITH REGARD TO CONSULTATIONS AS EXPRESSED IN
PARA 11 OF THE OTTAWA DECLARATION. COMMENT: WE CONSIDER
REINFORCED NAC ON THE FAR EAST TO HAVE BEEN HIGHLY SUCCESSFUL
IN ENHANCING THE POLITICAL CONSULTATIVE PROCESS IN THE ALLIANCE
AND ALSO IN PROVIDING OUR 14 NATO ALLIES WITH A LUCID AND
FORCEFUL EXPOSE OF US POLICIES AND OBJECTIVES IN THIS HIGHLY
IMPORTANT REGION OF THE WORLD. END SUMMARY.

1. ACTING SECRETARY GENERAL PANSA OPENED REINFORCED NAC OF
OCTOBER 29 BY WELCOMING ATTENDANCE OF HIGH-LEVEL OFFICIALS
FROM BELGIUM (AMBASSADOR WENDELEN), FRG (ASSISTANT SECRETARY
LAHN), ITALY (MINISTER SALIMEI), NETHERLANDS (FE AFFAIRS
DIRECTOR ROOKMAKER), UK (ASSISTANT UNDER-SECRETARY MALD) AND
US (ASSISTANT SECRETARY HABIB). PANSA SAID THIS MEETING WOULD
FURTHER STRENGTHEN THE PROCESS OF POLITICAL CONSULTATION
WITHIN THE COUNCIL.

2. ASSISTANT SECRETARY HABIB (US) SAID THERE WAS A GREAT
DEAL OF APPREHENSION IN ASIA AFTER THE FALL OF SAIGON.
GENERALLY SPEAKING, SUCH APPREHENSION HAS ABATED. THE MAJOR
POWER BALANCE IN EAST ASIA REMAINS ESSENTIALLY UNCHANGED,
ALTHOUGH THERE ARE SEVERAL NEW PRESSURE POINTS. THE REACTION
OF THE REGION TO EVENTS IN INDOCHINA HAS BEEN MEASURED AND
TEMPERATE. COUNTRIES ARE MOTIVATED BY NATIONALISTIC ASPIRATIONS
AND ARE DETERMINED TO MAINTAIN THEIR INDEPENDENCE. THEY
ARE EVOLVING THEIR OWN POLICIES AND HAVE DEVELOPED A
CONFIDENTIAL

PAGE 03  NATO 05933  01 OF 06  311750Z

BETTER APPRECIATION OF THE SIGNIFICANCE OF SELF-RELIANCE AS
A FACTOR IN SECURITY MATTERS. HE SAID THERE IS GENERAL DESIRE
FOR CLOSER IDENTIFICATION WITH THE NON-ALIGNED BLOC. THIS
IS ESPECIALLY TRUE IN NON-COMMUNIST SOUTHEAST ASIA; SOME OF
THESE COUNTRIES WERE MEMBERS OF NON-ALIGNED IN THE PAST AND
THEY HAVE BROUGHT OTHERS ALONG. THERE IS A WIDE-SPREAD
REGIONAL VIEW THAT CONTINUED US PRESENCE AND INVOLVEMENT
IN THE AREA IS BENEFICIAL FOR ASIA.

3. HABIB DESCRIBED US REACTION TO THE INDOCHINA AFTERMATH
AS NOT SUBSTANTIAL. A DIVISIVE DOMESTIC POLITICAL ISSUE HAS
BEEN REMOVED. US INTENDS TO MAINTAIN MORE NORMAL INTERESTS
IN ASIA. THIS WILL INCLUDE CONTINUED FORWARD DEPLOYMENT OF
US FORCES IN ASIA INCLUDING SUBSIDIARY DEPLOYMENT OF FORCES
IN KOREA AND THAILAND, ALTHOUGH THE LATTER DEPLOYMENT WILL
END NEXT YEAR.

4. HABIB SAW CERTAIN RESTRAINTS ON MAJOR POWERS -- CHINA,
SOVIET UNION, JAPAN AND US -- AFTER THE FALL OF INDOCHINA.
ALL MAJOR POWERS RECOGNIZE THAT UNDER PRESENT CIRCUMSTANCES,
NO ONE POWER CAN ESTABLISH HEGEMONY IN THE AREA. THE OVER-
RIDING CHINESE PREOCCUPATION IS THREAT OF SOVIET HEGEMONY
IN ASIA. ALL MAJOR POWERS RECOGNIZE THAT IN THIS PERIOD,
IT IS IN OUR COMMON INTEREST TO ACT WITH MODERATION AND
RESTRAINT. THE SINO-SOVIET RIVALRY, THE US-JAPANESE ALLIANCE,
US AND JAPANESE ECONOMIC PREDOMINANCE IN ASIA, AND LIMITED
SOVIET ENTREE TO ASIAN SECURITY ARRANGEMENTS GENERALLY
CONTRIBUTE TO STABILITY. THESE FACTORS ARE NOT LIKELY TO
CHANGE SIGNIFICANTLY OVER THE SHORT TERM, AND PROBABLY NOT
OVER THE MEDIUM TERM AS WELL. EQUILIBRIUM COULD BE CHANGED
SIGNIFICANTLY IF THE SINO-SOVIET RIVALRY WERE DRASTICALLY
ALTERED OR IF RUSSIA ATTAINED MAJOR INFLUENCE IN ASIA, BUT
NEITHER APPEARS A LIKELY PROSPECT.

5. SMALLER COUNTRIES, ESPECIALLY IN SOUTHEAST ASIA, CAN
EXERCISE GREATER FLEXIBILITY AND MANEUVERABILITY IN SEEKING
NEW DIPLOMATIC INITIATIVES. THEY SEE USEFULNESS IN REGIONAL
GROUPINGS SUCH AS ASEAN. THERE WILL PROBABLY BE AN ASEAN
SUMMIT WITHIN THE NEXT FEW MONTHS. ASEAN IS BEGINNING TO GO
BEYOND GENERALITIES, INCLUDING PLANNING EXPANDED COORDIN-
ATION OF SECURITY EFFORTS. ASEAN IS SEEKING BETTER UNDER-
STANDING AND REALTIONS WITH COMMUNIST NEIGHBORS AND IS PAR-
TICULARLY CONCERNED ABOUT HANOI AS A SUB-REGIONAL POWER.
THEY ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THAILAND, WHICH IS REGARDED AS SICK
MAN OF ASIA. TWO COUNTRIES, THE PHILIPPINES AND THAILAND,
MOVED QUICKLY TO NORMALIZE RELATIONS WITH THE PRC. ASEAN IS
CONCERNED WITH THE IMPACT OF HANOI'S SUCCESS ON THEIR DOMESTIC
INSURGENTS' MOVEMENTS. THERE ARE A NUMBER OF INSURGENT
GROUPS IN BURMA. THREE DIFFERENT AREAS IN THAILAND AR
THREATENED. INSURGENTS IN MALAYSIA HAVE RECENTLY BECOME MORE
ACTIVE. THERE ARE TWO SUCH MOVEMENTS IN THE PHILIPPINES,
ONE MOSLEM AND ONE COMMUNIST. THERE IS ALSO AN INCIPIENT
MOVEMENT IN INDONESIA, SEPARATE FROM THE PROBLEM OF TIMOR.

6. HABIB SAID US-PRC RELATIONS ARE GOOD ALTHOUGH THEY ARE
CONFIDENTIAL

PAGE 02  NATO 05933  02 OF 06  311805Z

NOT YET FULLY NORMALIZED. THE PRC SEES US AS A COUNTER-
BALANCE AGAINST MOSCOW. THIS INTEREST IS STRONGER NOW TAN
AT THE BEGINNING OF US-PRC RELATIONSHIP. PEKING IS UNHAPPY
WITH DETENTE, AND MAKES ITS DISPLEASURE KNOWN AT EVERY OPPOR-
TUNITY BY EMPHASIZING THE DANGERS OF DETENTE. THE PRC CON-
TINUES TO HARP ON THEME THAT SOVIETS ARE FEINTING IN THE EAST
WHILE PREPARING TO STRIKE IN THE WEST.THEY CANNOT SEE THAT
THIS IS IRRELEVANT. THE PRC SEES US MILITARY PRESENCE ABROAD,
IN BOTH EUROPE AND ASIA, AS A NECESSARY COUNTERWEIGHT TO
SOVIET EXPANSIONISM. TAIWAN IS STILL THE MAIN OBSTACLE
PREVENTING FULL NORMALIZATION OF US-PRC RELATIONS. THE
PRC'S INSISTENCE ON THREE POINTS REGARDING TAIWAN -- ABRO-
GATION OF THE US-ROC DEFENSE TREATY, WITHDRAWAL OF US FORCES
AND BREAKING US-ROC RELATIONS -- ARE UNCHANGED. THE PRC IS
NOT, HOWEVER, PRESSING ON THIS ISSUE. PRESIDENT FORD WILL
VISIT PEKING WITHIN THE NEXT FEW WEEKS, BUT THIS TRIP WILL
INVOLVE MORE POLITICAL SYMBOLISM THAN CONCRETE RESULTS.

7. SINO-SOVIET RELATIONS REMAIN COOL. BORDER DISCUSSIONS
ARE IN A RECESS AND TRADE IS STAGNATING, WHILE THE RHETORICAL
BATTLE HAS GROWN SHARPER. PEKING SAYS MOSCOW IS THE
CHIEF THREAT TO WORLD PEACE AND SECURITY. THE SOVIETS AND
PRC COMPETE IN HANOI, PYONGYANG, TOKYO AND SOUTHEAST ASIA.

8. SINO-JAPANESE RELATIONS ARE RELATIVELY GOOD. THE CHINESE
CONTINUE TO INSIST ON THEIR ANTI-HEGEMONY CLAUSE IN ANY PEACE
TREATY WITH JAPAN. ALTHOUGH THIS WILL DELAY SIGNING OF A
TREATY, ONE WILL, IN THE END, BE SIGNED. THE PRC BACKS JAPAN
AGAINST MOSCOW ON THE NORTHERN TERRITORIES ISSUE. THE PRC
IS FOND OF SAYING, INCLUDING TO JAPANESE VISITORS, THAT US-
JAPANESE RELATIONS ARE MORE IMPORTANT AT THIS TIME THAN
JAPANESE-PRC RELATIONS. TOKYO'S RELATIONS ARE BETTER WITH
PEKING THAN WITH MOSCOW.

9. HABIB CHARACTERIZED THE INTERNAL SCENE IN CHINA AS
STESSING POLITICAL STABILITY, UNITY AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT.
CHOU EN-LAI IS ILL, AND FOR THIS REASON COULD NOT SEE SECRETARY
KISSINGER. MAO TSE-TUNG IS STILL ACTIVELY CONCERNED WITH
OVERALL POLICY AND FOREIGN AFFAIRS, ESPECIALLY RELATIONS WITH
MOSCOW. TENG HSIAO-P'ING IS SEEMINGLY IN CONFIDENT CONTROL.
THERE IS A COLLEGIAL CHARACTER TO CURRENT PRC LEADERSHIP.
CONFIDENTIAL

PAGE 03  NATO 05933  02 OF 06  311805Z

REHABILITATION OF SOME OF THOSE PURGED DURING THE CULTURAL
REVOLUTION INDICATES MOVEMENT TOWARD MAINTAINING THE BALANCE
WITHIN THE LEADERSHIP. THE SHUI HU CAMPAIGN HAS APPARENTLY
ENDED, REPLACED BY A CAMPAIGN TO INCREASE AGRICULTURAL PRO-
DUCTIVITY. ANOTHER IDEOLOGICAL CAMPAIGN APPEARS TO BE IN
THE OFFERING. THE LINES OF SUCCESSION APPEAR TO BE SET, BUT
IT IS NOT CLEAR WHETHER THE SUCCESSION WILL PERPETRATE COL-
LEGIAL LEADERSHIP.

10. HABIB SAID JAPANESE RELATIONS WITH THE US ARE THE BEST
THEY HAVE EVER BEEN. EFFECTS OF THE NIXON SHOCKS ARE CLEARLY
PAST. THE EMPORER'S VISIT TO THE US WAS SYMBOLIC OF EXCELLENT,
CLOSE BILATERAL RELATIONS. WE DO NOT HAVE PROBLEMS WITH
JAPAN IN THE OLD SENSE OF THE WORD. WE COOPERATE CLOSELY
WITH JAPAN ON ALL MATTERS, INCLUDING DEFENSE. WE ARE PREPARED
TO ACCOMMODATE TO THE PACE SET BY JAPAN, AND WE ARE NOT
PRESSING JAPAN TO EXPAND ITS DEFENSE FORCES SIGNIFICANTLY.
WE BELIEVE CONSTITUTIONAL, POLITICAL AND BUDGETARY CONSTRAINTS
WILL PROVIDE APPROPRIATE LIMITATIONS.

11. JAPAN'S RELATIONS WITH THE SOVIETS ARE NOT ALL THAT WARM.
THERE IS A JAPANESE TILT TOWARD CHINA. SOVIET PRESSURE
TACTICS REGARDING THE PRC HEGEMONY CLAUSE IN A FUTURE PEACE
TREATY AND A HARDENED SOVIET ATTITUDE TOWARD THE NORTHERN
TERRITORIES HAVE COOLED TOKYO-MOSCOW RELATIONS. JOINT ECONOMIC
ACTIVITIES WITH THE SOVIETS ARE MOVING SLOWLY.

12. TOKYO IS KEENLY ATTUNED TO DEVELOPMENTS IN ASIA, PAR-
TICULARLY ON THE KOREAN PENINSUAL AND IN SOUTHEAST ASIA.
JAPANESE RELATIONS WITH THE ROK HAVE IMPROVED. JAPAN IS ALSO
SEEKING TO DEFUSE TENSIONS ON THE KOREAN PENINSUAL BY TRYING
TO DRAW NORTH KOREA INTO MORE REASONABLE RELATIONSHIPS WITH
THE ROK AND EVEN WITH THE US. JAPAN'S INTEREST IN SOUTHEAST
ASIA IS PRIMARILY ECONOMIC. JAPAN ADJUSTED RELATIONS WITH
HANOI QUICKLY. THEY HAVE AN EMBASSY IN HANOI AND WILL PROVIDE
US$45 MILLION IN AID TO THE DRV OVER NEXT TWO YEARS.
JAPAN SEES ITSELF AS A BRIDGE BETWEEN HANOI AND THE US.

13. HABIB SAW THE NATURAL DIVERSITY OF THE REGION AS A SIG-
NIFICANT FACTOR IN THE POWER EQUILIBRIUM. OUR PREOCCUPATION,
AND THAT OF OTHERS, WITH INDOCHINA IS FINISHED. WHEN WE
CONFIDENTIAL

PAGE 04  NATO 05933  02 OF 06  311805Z

PREOCCUPIED HANOI'S ATTENTION THERE WAS LITTLE CONCERN IN
ASEAN. NOW THAT THIS PERIOD IS FINISHED, IT HAS CREATED
PROBLEMS FOR ASEAN. THE COUNTRIES OF THIS REGION SEE ECON-
OMIC DEVELOPMENT AND SECURITY GOING HAND IN HAND. THEY SEE
THEIR DEPENDENCE UPON A US COMMITMENT AND ARE CONCERNED
WHETHER WE WILL FULFILL THAT COMMITMENT. WE HAVE TRIED TO
REASSURE THESE COUNTRIES OF THE CONSTANCY AND CHARACTER OF
OUR COMMITMENT. THEREFORE WE HAVE NOT WITHDRAWN ANY OF OUR
FORCES PRECIPITOUSLY, EVEN FROM THAILAND. THE DIVERSITY OF
THE REGION, FORCES OF NATIONALISM, AND THE FAR-RANGING NATURE
OF SINO-SOVIET RIVALRY ARE FACTORS WHICH MAINTAIN THE
EQUILIBRIUM OF POWER IN ASIA. THESE PUT A PREMIUM ON FLEXI-
BILITY AND ON THE NEED TO WORK TO REDUCE TENSIONS AND CON-
FRONTATIONS. THIS EQUILIBRIUM OF THE POWER DYNAMIC MAY
NOT PREVAIL, BUT IT WIDENS THE OPPORTUNITY TO AVOID CONFRON-
TATION.

14. DR. ROOKMAKER (NETHERLANDS EXPERT) DISCUSSED THE
DEVELOPMENT OF ASEAN COUNTRIES' POLICIES AND THEIR IMPLICATIONS
FOR WESTERN APPROACH TO THE AREA. HE EMPHASIZED THAT SINCE THE
END OF THE VIETNAM CONFLICT ASEAN COUNTRIES HAVE RECOGNIZED
THAT THEY CANNOT FIGHT COMMUNISM WITH WEAPONS AND MUST CONCENTRATE
ON ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT PARTICULARLY FOR THE POORER SECTORS
OF THEIR SOCIETIES. HE SAID ASEAN COUNTRIES HAVE ADOPTED A
CONSTRUCTIVE POLICY TOWARD INDOCHINA AND HOPE EVENTUALLY THAT
THEIR OWN CONCEPT OF NEUTRALISM CAN BE EXTENDED TO EMBRACE
INDOCHINA. HE BELIEVED WESTERN COUNTRIES SHOULD TAKE ASEAN
ASPIRATIONS INTO ACCOUNT AND SHOULD NOT DISCRIMINATE AGAINST
INDOCHINA IN A WAY WHICH WOULD INHIBIT THE ACHIEVEMENT OF ASEAN'S
OBJECTIVES. FOR EXAMPLE, COOPERATION BETWEEN ASEAN AND INDOCHINA
WOULD BE FACILITATED IF WESTERN AID TO THE AREA WAS NOT DIRECTED
EXCLUSIVELY TO ASEAN COUNTRIES.

15. ERALP (TURKEY) ASKED HABIB TO COMMENT ON INTERNAL DEVELOPMENTS
IN CAMBODIA AND THE RELATIONSHIP OF CAMBODIA TO HANOI,
CHINA, AND THE USSR. HABIB RECALLED THAT WHEN PHNOM PENH
FELL, THE KHMER ROUGE EMPTIED PHNOM PENH AS WELL AS OTHER
CAMBODIAN CITIES AND ELIMINATED ALL OFFICIALS OF ANY STATURE.
CONFIDENTIAL

PAGE 02  NATO 05933  03 OF 06  311826Z

THE YOUND AND THE OLD SUFFERED MOST IN THIS OPERATION,
DURING WHICH THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE LOST THEIR LIVES. THE KHMER
ROUGE APPARENTLY WANTED TO BREAK DOWN THE EXISTING URBAN
STRUCTURE WHICH HAD CONTROLLED THE COUNTRY UNDER SIHANOUK
AND TO RULE THROUGH THE PARTY STRUCTURE OF THE KHMER ROUGE.
THIS STRUCTIRE REMAINS SHADOWY AND IT IS NOT YET POSSIBLE TO
DETERMINE WHO IS ON TOP.

16. AS TO CAMBODIA'S EXTERNAL RELATIONS, HABIB NOTED EVIDENCE
OF CONTINUING DISAGREEMENTS WITH HANOI. THERE HAD BEEN
FIGHTING OVER OFF-SHORE ISLANDS AND ENGAGEMENTS IN BORDER
AREAS. WHILE HANOI HAD WON THESE ENCOUNTERS, IT HAD NOT
ALWAYS DONE SO EASILY AND IN SOME INSTANCES NEEDED TO EMPLOY
ITS AIR FORCE. THERE WERE CONTACTS BETWEEN CAMBODIA AND
NORTH VIETNAMESE OFFICIALS AIMED AT SETTLING BORDER CONFLICTS,
BTU THESE EFFORTS HAD NOT BEEN VERY SUCCESSFUL. HABIB NOTED
THAT THE PRINCIPAL EXTERNAL INFLUENCE IN CAMBODIA AT PRESENT
IS PEKING. THE KHMER ROUGE HAVE NOT FORGOTTEN SOVIET SUPPORT
FOR LON NOL AND THE SOVIETS HAVE BEEN EFFECTIVELY EXLUDED
FROM CAMBODIA. IN THE NEAR FUTURE, THE KHMER ROUGE APPARENTLY
INTEND TO ALLOW ONLY THREE COUNTRIES, WHICH HELPED THEM
DURING THEIR STRUGGLE, TO BE REPRESENTED IN PHNOM PENH;
NORTH VIETNAM, CHINA, AND NORTH KOREA. HABIB OBSERVED THAT
THE RIVALRY BETWEEN HANOI AND PEKING IN CAMBODIA IS NOT
ENTIRELY CLEAR. HOWEVER, ONE CAN ARGUE THAT PEKING LOOKS ON
CAMBODIA AS A BUFFER STATE THAT COULD LIMIT HANOI'S SUBREGIONAL
HEGEMONY, WHICH PEKING FEARS MIGHT SERVE AS A SURROGATE
FOR SOVIET INFLUENCE IN THE AREA. HABIB CONCLUDED
THAT OUR INFORMATION INDICATES THE KHMER ROUGE DO NOT INTEND
TO PERMIT ANY WESTERN EMBASSIES IN CAMBODIA FOR SOME TIME.
IT MAY BE A YEAR OR TWO BEFORE THE WEST BEGINS TO DEVELOP
SOME INFLUENCE IN CAMBODIA.

17. BUSCH (NORWAY) PROVIDED THE FOLLOWING INDICATIONS OF
CAMBODIAN POLICIES PICKED UP RECENTLY BY NORWEGIAN OFFICIALS:
A CAMBODIAN IN CONTACT WITH SIHANOUK SAID THE PRINCE IS NEEDED
AS A NATIONAL SYMBOL IN CAMBODIA BUT WOULD NOT BE GIVEN ANY
INTERNAL POWER. SIHANOUK WOULD RETURN TO CAMBODIA AT THE END
OF DECEMBER AND WOULD REMAIN THERE FOR SOME SIX MONTHS. AN
EASTERN EUROPEAN CONTACT TOLD THE NORWEGIANS THE KHMER ROUGE
INTEND TO PERMIT EIGHT ADDITIONAL COUNTRIES TO ESTABLISH A
CONFIDENTIAL

PAGE 03  NATO 05933  03 OF 06  311826Z

DIPLOMATIC PRESENCE IN CAMBODIA: ALGERIA, ALBANIA, ROMANIA,
YUGOSLAVIA, EGYPT, LAOS, MAURITANIA, AND SOUTH VIETNAM.
SWEDEN MAY ACCREDIT A DIPLOMATIC REPRESENTATIVE TO CAMBODIA
BY THE END OF THIS YEAR. THE KHMER ROUGE MAY BEGIN TO ADMIT
CORRESPONDENTS INTO CAMBODIA BY THE BEGINNING OF 1976. BUSCH
ALSO MENTIONED THAT NORWEGIAN CONTACTS HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO
ESTABLISH ANY POSITIVE CONFIRMATION THAT NORTH VIETNAM IS
PROVIDING MILITARY ASSISTANCE TO THAI INSURGENTS THROUGH
CAMBODIA.

18. ASSISTNAT UNDER-SECRETARY MALE (UK EXPERT) AGREED WITH
HABIB'S PRESENTATION AND SAID THE UK APPROACHES THE REGION
IN TERMS OF THE UK DESIRE FOR STABILITY IN THE AREA. HE
NOTED THAT CHINESE-SOVIET COMPETITION HAS A DEFINITE EFFECT
ON DEVELOPMENTS IN SOUTHEAST ASIA. ON THE BASIS OF BRITISH
EXPERIENCE, HE CONFIRMED THAT THE CINESE ARE EMPHASIZING
THE DANGERS OF DETENTE TO WESTERN VISITORS. TENG HSIAO-P'ING
MADE THIS CLEAR TO HEATH AS DID MAO IN EVEN STARKER TERMS.
UK POLICY TOWARD CHINA AIRMS TO DO WHAT IS POSSIBLE TO BRING
CHINA INTO THE BROADER WORLD. UK RELATIONS WITH THE PRC
ARE GOOD AS IS EVIDENCED BY THE LACK OF ANY UNCOMFORTABLE
CHINESE INTERVENTIONS IN HONG KONG. BRITISH INTEREST TO A
CONSIDERABLE DEGREE FOCUSES ON HONG KONG WHERE CHINA OBVIOUSLY
COULD MAKE TROUBLE IF IT WISHED TO.

19. MALE SAID THE BRITISH REGARD THE CURRENT KOREAN SITUATION
AS &quot;SAFE&quot;, PARTICULARLY SINCE KIM IL-SONG WAS REBUFFED
IN PEKING WHEN HE SOUGHT SUPPORT FOR A FORWARD POLICY AFTER
THE FALL OF SAIGON. AS TO ASEAN, THE BRITISH REGARD THIS AS
A LOCALLY GROWN ORGANIZATION AND THUS ONE WHICH HAS A GOOD
INTERNATIONAL APPEARANCE. IT APPEARS TO BE AN ORGANIZATION
WITH A LONG-TERM POTENTIAL, BUT WITHOUT IMMEDIATE EFFICACY.
THE BRITISH ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE PROGRESS OF THE INSUGENCIES
IN THAILAND AND MALAYSIA.

20. KILLICK (UK) NOTED WITH INTEREST HABIB'S REPORT THAT
DURING THEIR VISIT TO PEKING, US OFFICIALS HAD TOLD THE
CHINESE THAT IT WAS IRRELEVANT WHETHER THE USSR WAS, AS THE
CHINESE MAINTAIN, FEINTING TO THE EAST WHILE ATTACKING TO
THE WEST. KILLICK AGREED THAT THE CHINESE POSITION MIGHT
BE IRRELEVANT IN A GEOPHYSICAL OR STRATEGIC SENSE. HOWEVER,
CONFIDENTIAL

PAGE 04  NATO 05933  03 OF 06  311826Z

HE BELIEVED THE US ATTITUDE WAS RELEVANT IN TERMS OF
US SECURITY COMMITMENTS. HE ASKED WHETHER HE WAS CORRECT
IN INTERPRETING THE US COMMENTS TO MEAN THAT THE US WOULD
NOT STAND IDLY BY IF THE SOVIETS MOVED AGAINST THE EAST.
HABIB SAID KILLICK WAS CORRECT. KILLICK'S ANALYSIS WAS
PRESCIENT: THAT WAS PRECISLY WHAT SECRETARY KISSINGER
MEANT TO CONVEY. THE US WOULD OPPOSE EFFORTS TO ACHIEVE
HEGEMONY IN THE EAST OR IN THE WEST. HABIB EMPHASIZED THAT
IT WAS NOT FOR HIM TO SAY HOW THE US WOULD OPPOSE MOVES
TOWARD HEGEMONY IN THE EAST. ANY SUCH MOVES WOULD NATURALLY
RAISE SERIOUS ISSUES WHICH WOULD HAVE TO BE CONSIDERED
AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF THE US GOVERNMENT.

21. SPEAKING TO MALE'S COMMENTS ON KOREA, HABIB SAID THE
US GENERALLY AGREES THAT THE SITUATION IS CURRENTLY &quot;SAFE&quot;
IN THAT THERE IS NO INDICATION THAT HOSTILITIES MIGHT BREAK
OUT IN THE NEAR FUTURE. HE EMPHASIZED, HOWEVER, THAT
KOREA IS ONE AREA IN EAST ASIA WHERE MISCALCULATION COULD
LEAD TO CONFLICT INVOLVING THE MAJOR POWERS, INCLUDING THE
US, WHICH CONTINUES TO MAINTAIN 40,000 TROOPS IN KOREA.
HABIB AGREED, AS WELL, THAT THE CHINESE WITHHELD THE SUPPORT
WHICH KIM SOUGHT IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING THE END OF THE
VIETNAM CONFLICT. HE NOTED, HOWEVER, THAT THE UNITED STATES
ALSO MADE IT CLEAR IN UNMISTAKEABLE TERMS THAT WE WOULD NOT
PERMIT KIM TO CARRY OUT ADVENTURES IN SOUTH KOREA. WE BELIEVE
KIM GOT THE MESSAGE.

22. HABIB SAID NORTH KOREA'S CURRENT POLICY APPEARED AIMED
AT A) WEAKENING THE INTERNATIONAL POSITION OF SOUTH KOREA,
B) ACHIEVING US WITHDRAWAL FROM SOUTH KOREA, AND C) AWAITING
INTERNAL CONTRADICTIONS IN SOUTH KOREA WHICH NORTH KOREA
COULD EXPLOIT. HABIB SAID THESE OBJECTIVES ARE REFLECTED IN
NORTH KOREAN TACTICS AT THE UN WHICH ARE CLEARLY DIRECTED
NOT ONLY AT BREAKING DOWN INTERNATIONAL SUPPORT FOR SOUTH
KOREA, BUT ALSO AGAINST THE UNITED STATES AND ITS POLICIES
TOWARD SOUTH KOREA. HABIB WAS GLAD TO SEE THAT OUR EUROPEAN
ALLIES APPEAR GENERALLY TO RECOGNIZE NORTH KOREA'S OBJECTIVES
AND THAT THEY OPPOSE THE UNFRIENDLY RESOLUTION ON KOREA AND
SUPPORT THE FRIENDLY RESOLUTION. HE STRESSED THE IMPORTANCE
OF MAINTAINING A COHESIVE WESTERN EFFORT IN THIS REGARD
BECAUSE THERE WOULD BE A REAL PROSPECT OF SERIOUS TROUBLE
IN EAST ASIA IF US SUPPORT FOR SOUTH KOREA WAS WITHDRAWN,
IF SOUTH KOREA WERE WEAKENED INTERNALLY, OR IF SOUTH KOREA
WAS CUT OFF FROM OTHER INTERNATIONAL SUPPORT.

23. DE STAERCKE (BELGIUM) ASKED HABIB TO COMMENT ON A) THE
DISSOLUTION OF SEATO AND HIS OBSERVATION THAT THE US STILL
RETAINS A COMMITMENT, AND B) THE PARADOX OF CHINESE POLICY
CONFIDENTIAL

PAGE 02  NATO 05933  04 OF 06  311913Z

WHICH URGES THE WEST TO PROTECT ITSELF AGAINST THE USSR, BUT
ENCOURAGES DEVELOPMENTS WHICH TEND TO UNDERMINE THE POWER OF
THE WEST.

24. HABIB POINTED OUT THAT, AT THE INSISTENCE OF THE
PHILIPPINES, SEATO WOULD DISAPPEAR OVER A TWO-YEAR PERIOD.
MANILA HAS A BILATERAL DEFENSE ARRANGEMENT WITHTHE UNITED
STATES AND THUS DOES NOT DEPEND ON SEATO. THAILAND DID NOT
HAVE SIMILAR ARRANGEMENTS WITH THE UNITED STATES AND HAD
WITHER WANTED SEATO RETAINED OR, AT A MINIMUM, THAT THE PROVISIONS
OF THE MANILA PACT REMAIN VALID. ACCORDINGLY, THE
PROVISIONS OF THE MANILA TREATY AS WELL AS THOSE OF THE RUSH-
THANAT EXCHANGE, WHICH FURTHER DEFINES THE US-THAI RELATIONSHIP,
REMAIN IN FORCE. THE US DID NOT ATTEMPT TO FORCE
DECISIONS ONE WAY OR THE OTHER ON THE RETENTION OF SEATO,
PREFERRING TO LET THE ASIANS DECIDE THE ISSUE.

25. RESPONDING TO THE QUESTION OF PRC INVOLVEMENT IN THE
THIRD WORLD, HABIB NOTED SOME CHINESE ACTIVITY IN AFRICA,
MOST RECENTLY IN ANGOLA, BUT SAID THE CHINESE DO NOT HAVE
THE ECONOMIC OR POLITICAL POWER TO PROJECT INTO THE THIRD
WORLD. CHINA CAN BE EXPECTED, HOWEVER, TO SUPPORT CAUSES
IN THIRD WORLD FORA THAT ARE INIMICAL TO SOVIET INTERESTS.
MOREOVER, THE CHINESE WILL INSIST THAT THEY ARE PART OF THE
THIRD WORLD, THOUGH MANY THIRD WORLD COUNTRIES WOULD QUESTION
THAT ASSERTION. GENERALLY SPEAKING, CHINA CANNOT BE EXPECTED
TO BE VERY ACTIVE OUTSIDE OF ITS OWN BOUNDARIES EXCEPT WHERE
SOVIET INTERESTS ARE CONCERNED. THE USSR IS THE &quot;BE-ALL,
END-ALL OF CHINESE ENMITY&quot; AND PEKING CAN THUS BE COUNTED
UPON TO ATTEMPT TO FRUSTRATE THE SOVIETS WHEREVER AND WHEN-
EVER THEY CAN.

26 FRG PERMREP KRAP THANKED HABIB FOR HIS ILLUMINATING
AND CONCISE PRESENTATION. HE AGREED THAT KOREA IS POTENTIALLY
THE MOST DANGEROUS AREA IN THE FAR EAST. RECALLING
HIS OWN EXTENSIVE EXPERIENCE IN JAPAN, KRAPF NOTED THAT THE
JAPANESE HAD NEVER FELT PARTICULARLY THREATENED BY CHINA OR
THE SOVIET UNION, BUT FEARED INVOLVEMENT IN A POSSIBLE KOREAN
CONFLICT. JAPAN THUS IS WORRIED ABOUT POSSIBLE UNWISE
INITIATIVES TAKEN BY THE SOUTH KOREANS ACTING ON THE PREMISE
THAT THEY ARE MILITARILY SUPERIOR TO THE NORTH KOREANS.
CONFIDENTIAL

PAGE 03  NATO 05933  04 OF 06  311913Z

KRAPF NOTED THAT THE US SEEMED TO ACCEPT THE SLOW PACE OF
JAPAN'S DEFENSE BUILDUP. DOES THAT PACE CARRYWITH IT THE
INFERENCE THAT JAPAN NO LONGER FEELS A STRONG DEFENSE
NECESSARY BECAUSE IT SEES LESS RISK OF A NEW KOREAN CONFLICT?

27. HABIB REPLIED THAT JAPAN SAW KOREAN DEFENSE AS PRIMARILY
A US RESPONSIBILITY. WHILE REALIZING THAT KOREAN SECURITY
IS IMPORTNAT TO THEIR OWN, THE JAPANESE BELIEVE THE US WILL
DEFEND SOUTH KOREA. ALTHOUGH JAPAN CAN DO NOTHING MILITARILY
IN KOREA, IT CAN PROVIDE ECONOMIC ASSISTANCE, JAPAN AGREES
WITH THE US THAT THERE IS NO IMMEDIATE PROSPECT OF KOREAN
HOSTILITIES. THE JAPANESE FULLY APPRECIATE, HOWEVER, THE
MEANING OF THE LINE DIVIDING THE TWO KOREAS AND THE FACT THAT
THERE ARE ONE MILLION MEN UNDER ARMS FACING EACH OTHER ACROSS
THAT LINE WITH INCREASINGLY MORE MODERN WEAPONS. MOREOVER,
THE JAPANESE RECOGNIZE NORTH KOREA AS PERHAPS THE MOST PUGNACIOUS
COMMUNIST POWER -- ONE THAT MAY BE EVEN MORE ISOLATED
THAN ALBANIA -- WHERE THE CULT OF THE INDIVIDUAL IS CARRIED
TO THE EXTREME AND WHERE IRRATIONAL ACTS MIGHT BE POSSIBLE.
JAPAN CLEARLY HOPES THAT THE KOREAN PROBLEM CAN BE ACCOMMODATED
AND PERMANENTLY DEFUSED OVER TIME. IN THE MEANTIME, TOKYO
WARNS THE US ABOUT THE KOREAN SITUATION AND URGES THAT US
FORCES NOT BE REDUCED. A FURTHER RESTRAINING FACTOR
IS THE FACT THAT NORTH
KOREA KNOWS THAT IT COULD NOT EARILY
ATTACK THE SOUTH.

28. AMBASSADOR KRAPF NOTED JAPAN'S AWARENESS THAT WHILE IT
COULD NOT SEND TROOPS TO KOREA, IT COULD BECOME INVOLVED
IN A KOREAN CONFLICT THROUGH US USE OF ITS BASES IN JAPAN.
HABIB REPLIED THAT JAPAN HAD GUARANTEED CONTINUED US USE OF
ITS JAPANESE BASES AND FULLY RECOGNIZES THAT IT WOULD
BE EXTREMELY DIFFICULT FOR THE US TO FIGHT IN KOREA WITHOUT
BASES IN JAPAN.

29. CANADIAN PERMREP MENZIES WELCOMED THE FAR EASTERN CONSULTATION
AS USEFUL AND TIMELY. HE PARTICULALY WELCOMED ASSISTANT
SECRETARY HABIB AND EXPERTS FROM OTHER ALLIED CAPITALS, AND
EXPRESSED REGRET THAT A CANADIAN EXPERT COULD NOT BE PRESENT.
REFERRING TO CANADA'S (AND THEREFORE TO NATO'S) 2400-MILE
FRONTIER ON THE PACIFIC, MENZIES NOTED ACTIVE CANADIAN INTEREST
CONFIDENTIAL

PAGE 04  NATO 05933  04 OF 06  311913Z

IN PACIFIC DEVELOPMENTS EVEN THOUGH CANADA CAN TAKE SHELTER
BEHIND THE UNITED STATES' PACIFIC DEFENSE EFFORT. CANADA'S
ROLE IN THE AREA HAD BEEN LIMITED TO PEACEKEEPING BOTH IN KOREA
AND, WITH A SOMEWHAT LESS SALUTARY RESULT, IN VIETNAM.
CANADA APPRECIATED US EFFORTS IN THE PACIFIC, THOUGH SOMETIMES
IN THE PAST OTTAWA THOUGHT THE US WAS OVEREXTENDED IN THE AREA
AND PERHAPS OVERLY HOSTILE TO THE PRC. ALTOGETHER, THE GOC FOUND
RECENT POST-VIETNAM ADJUSTMENTS IN US ASIAN POLICY MUCH MORE
PALATABLE AND SATISFACTORY. CANADA NOW AGREED WITH US ASIAN
POLICY.

30. MENZIES CHARACTERIZED THE THEME OF THE NAC CONSULTATION
AS THE SEARCH FOR STABILITY IN THE PACIFIC AREA. MANY NATO
COUNTRIES HAVE INTERESTS IN ASIA -- AN AREA WHICH PRESENTLY
HAS NO REGIONAL IDENTITY, AND WHERE SOME POWER MAY TRY TO
EXPLOIT THE POST-VIETNAM SITUATION DESPITE US ASSURANCES OF
CONTINUING SUPPORT FOR EXISTING RELATIONSHIPS IN THE AREA.
WHILE IT APPEARED THAT THE ASIAN MAINLAND HAS NO RESOURCES
IN WHICH NATO COUNTRIES HAD A DIRECT INTEREST, THIS WAS NOT
TRUE IN THE CASE OF INSULAR ASIA WITH THE OIL AND MINERAL
RESOURCES OF INDONESIA, THE MINERAL WEALTH OF THE PHILIPPINES,
AND THE ENORMOUS MINERAL DEPOSITS OF AUSTRALIA AND PAPUA-NEW
GUINEA. THE ALLIES MIGHT APPROPRIATELY ASK THEMSELVES
IF THEY ARE PAYING ENOUGH ATTENTIION TO NAVAL DEVELOPMENTS
IN THE PACIFIC. NATO'S NAVAL ADVISORS TALK FREQUENTLY
ABOUT PROTECTING THE VITAL TRADE ROUTES IN THE INDIAN
AND ATLANTIC OCEANS. THEY SHOULD ALSO BE CONSCIOUS
THAT THE TRADE ROUTES SUSTAINING JAPAN WERE SIMILARLY ESSEN-
TIAL GIVEN JAPAN'S ECONOMIC IMPORTANCE AND THE REQUIREMENT
THAT IT NOT BE FORCED TO CHOOSE BETWEEN CHINA OR THE SOVIET
UNION.

CONFIDENTIAL

PAGE 02  NATO 05933  05 OF 06  311928Z

31. RAISING A SERIES OF QUESTIONS, MENZIES ASKED FIRST IF
JAPAN'S RELUCTANCE TO SUPPORT SOUTH KOREA MILITARILY MEANT
THAT JAPAN MIGHT BE PREAPRED TO MAKE A NAVAL DEFENSE CONTRI-
BUTION, PERHAPS IN ANTI-SUBMARINE WARFARE, IN DISTANT AREAS
AS FAR SOUTH AS SINGAPORE. NOTING HABIB'S STATEMENT OF US
INTEREST IN MAINTAINING THE BALANCE OF POWER BETWEEN CHINA
AND THE USSR, MENZIES SAID HE FOUND IT DIFFICULT TO CONCEIVE
OF A US STRATEGIC RESPONSE ON CHINA'S BEHALF WERE THE
SOVIETS TO LAUNCH A PRE-EMPTIVE STRIKE ON CHINESE STRATEGIC
NUCLEAR INSTALLATIONS. MENZIES SAID HE COULD PERSONALLY
UNDERSTAND US SUPPORT FOR CHINA IN SUCH A SITUATION, BUT ONLY
BY MEANS SHORT OF DIRECT MILITARY INTERVENTION. HE COULD
NOT CONCEIVE OF DIRECT US CONVENTIONAL INVOLVEMENT IN A
BORDER SCUFFLE ALONG THE LONG SINO-SOVIET FRONTIER. MENZIES
ASKED, THEREFORE, HOW THE US MIGHT USE ITS &quot;STRATEGIC NUCLEAR
UMBRELLA&quot; IN THE ABOVE CONTEXT. IN THE EVENT OF SINO-SOVIET
HOSTILITIES, MENZIES ASSUMED THAT MOST COUNTRIES WOULD &quot;THANK
GOD&quot; THAT THEY ARE NOT CAUGHT BETWEEN THE TWO ANTAGONISTS
LIKE CANADA IS BETWEEN THE US AND THE USSR.

32. MENZIES ALSO ASKED FRENCH PERMREP DE ROSE ABOUT THE
MAINTANANCE OF FRENCH CULTURAL INFLUENCE IN INDOCHINA AFTER
THE COMMUNIST ASSUMPTION OF POWER IN THOSE STATES. MENZIES
NOTED THAT ONLY THREE COUNTRIES NOW MAINTAIN DIPLOMATIC
RELATIONS WITH CAMBODIA. IN HIS PERSONAL VIEW, FRENCH
INFLUENCE IN INDOCHINA HAD ALWAYS BEEN STRONG AND WOULD NOT
BE EASILY ERASED FROM THE AREA. HE WONDERED, THEREFORE, IF
AMBASSADOR DE ROSE COULD COMMENT ON FRENCH RELATIONS WITH
NORTH AND SOUTH VIETNAM AND ON CAMBODIA. (DE ROSE DID NOT
RESPOND).

33. REFERRING TO MENZIES' COMMENT ABOUT NAVAL DEVELOPMENTS
IN THE PACIFIC, PANSA NOTED AN OCTOBER 29 AFP REPORT THAT
THE SOVIET PACIFIC FLEET WAS CURRENTLY &quot;TWICE AS IMPORTANT&quot;
AS THE US SEVENTH FLEET.

34. CONCERNING JAPANESE &quot;OVERSEAS DEPLOYMENT&quot;, HABIB
RESPONDED THAT THE BASIC JAPANESE POSTURE IS IN DEFENSE OF
THE HOMELAND ISLANDS. SOME YEARS AGO, THERE WAS TALK OF
EXPANDING THEIR CAPABILITY, BUT THIS HAS BEEN DROPPED. FOR
THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE, JAPAN WILL BE DEPLOYED WITHIN THE
CONFIDENTIAL

PAGE 03  NATO 05933  05 OF 06  311928Z

IMMEDIATE AREA, I.E., WITHIN 1,000 MILES OF THE HOMELAND
ISLANDS AND WITH A MAJOR EMPHASIS ON ANTI-SUBMARINE WARFARE.

35. CONCERNING THE QUESTION OF STRATEGY, HABIB REPEATED THAT
GENERALLY SPEAKING, THE UNITED STATES WOULD OPPOSE ANY MOVE
BY THE SOVIETS TO IMPOSE BY FORCE RPT FORCE ITS PRESENCE
IN EAST ASIA. AS TO AMBASSADOR MENZIES' THEORETICAL QUESTION,
HABIB COULD ONLY REPEAT THAT THE MEANS WHICH WOULD BE EMPLOYED
TOWARD THIS END WOULD DEPEND ON THE CIRCUMSTANCES.

36. SVART (DENMARK) WISHED TO CLARIFY THAT THE FAILURE OF
A DANISH FAR EAST EXPERT TO BE IN ATTENDANCE SHOULD NOT BE
TAKEN AS SUGGESTING A LACK OF INTEREST IN THIS CONSULTATION
OR IN THE FAR EAST. HE SAID IT WAS SIMPLY A QUESTION OF THE
THINNESS OF DANISH MFA RESOURCES. AS A MEASURE OF HIS
COUNTRY'S INTEREST, SVART CALLED ATTENTION TO THE VISIT WHICH
FONMIN ANDERSON HAS JUST BEGUN TO SEVERAL COUNTRIES IN THE
FAR EAST. TURNING TO HIS QUESTIONS, SVART ASKED WHETHER
DURING HABIB'S RECENT TRAVELS HE HAD ENCOUNTERED ANY NEW
INDICATIONS OF SOVIET EFFORTS IN EAST ASIA ALONG THE LINES
OF THEIR PROPOSAL FOR AN ASIAN COLLECTIVE SECURITY PACT
OR A WORLD-WIDE CONFERENCE OF COMMUNIST PARTIES. SECONDLY,
SVART ASKED WHAT IS GOING ON IN SAIGON AT THE PRESENT TIME.

37. HABIB OBSERVED THAT AS A GENERAL PROPOSITION, ALL THE
ASIANS HE MET TENDED TO LOOK WITH &quot;CONCERN&quot; ON THE PEOPLE'S
REPUBLIC AND THE HANOI REGIME. IN CONTRAST, THEY WOULD EXPRESS
&quot;FEAR&quot; OF SOVIET POWER AND INTENTIONS. THROUGHOUT THE EAST
ASIAN ARCH, THIS PHENOMENON OF PREJUDICE, WELL-BASED IN
HISTORY OF COURSE, SEEMED TO PREVAIL. CONCERNING SAIGON,
HABIB SAID THE UNITED STATES NEVER DOUBTED THAT HANOI RAN
THE COMMUNIST MOVEMENT IN SOUTH VIETNAM. ON THE BASIS OF
WHAT THE UNITED STATES HAS BEEN ABLE TO PICK UP FROM VARIOUS
SOURCES ABOUT WHAT IS GOING ON IN SAIGON, THIS VIEWPOINT
HAS BEEN CONFIRMED. A RESTRUCTURING OF THE SOCIETY RIGHT
DOWN TO THE VILLAGE LEVEL SEEMS TO BE IN PROGRESS. THERE IS
NO REAL GOVERNMENT IN THE SOUTH INDEPENDENT OF THE HANOI
STRUCTURE. IN FACT, THERE IS VERY LITTLE PRETENSE OF AN
INDEPENDENT GOVERNMENT IN THE SOUTH. THE PRG, WHICH WAS
NEVER ANYTHING MORE THAN A SHADOW GOVERNMENT, DOES NOT EVEN
FUNCTION IN SAIGON, WHICH IS RUN BY A GENERAL. THE NUMBER ONE
CONFIDENTIAL

PAGE 04  NATO 05933  05 OF 06  311928Z

MAN IN THE SOUTH IS MR. PHAM HUNG, A MEMBER OF THE NORTH
VIETNAMESE POLITBURO, AND HE CONTINUES AS NUMBER ONE JUST
AS HE HAS BEEN SINCE THE '60S, WHEN HIS PREDECESSOR WAS KILLED
IN A B-52 RAID. FURTHERMORE, THERE SEEMS TO BE AN INCREASE
OF NORTH VIETNAMESE-TRAINED SOUTHERN CADRE RETURNING TO THE
SOUTH AFTER PERIODS OF TRAINING IN NORTH VIETNAM. HABIB
SAID HIS PERSONAL OPINION IS THAT REUNIFICATION WILL COME
ABOUT SOONER RATHER THAN LATER, EVEN BEFORE THE END OF 1976.

38. HABIB SAID THAT THUS FAR, THE MASSIVE BLOOD BATH WHICH
THE UNITED STATES FEARED HAS NOT TAKEN PLACE. IT SHOULD BE
BORNE IN MIND THE UNITED STATES TOOK OUT 130,000 SOUTH
VIETNAMESE WHO MIGHT BE CONSIDERED AS PRIMARY TARGETS FOR
VIOLENT REPRISALS. OTHERWISE, HE SAID IT SEEMS A MASSIVE
RE-EDUCATION PROCESS IS UNDER WAY, WITH ORGANIZATION OF THE
URBAN POPULATION INTO CELLS AND BLOCK CELLS WITH THE EFFORT
GRADUALLY EXPANDING OUT INTO THE COUNTRYSIDE.

39. CATALANO (ITALY) JOINED IN EXPRESSING APPRECIATION FOR
HABIS'S PRESENCE AND HIS BRIEFING. HE SAID ALREADY THE
MORNING SESSION HAD, IN HIS VIEW, BEEN ONE OF THE BEST
ALLIANCE CONCULTATIONS HE COULD REMEMBER AND THAT MEETINGS
OF THIS SORT OUGHT TO BE AMONG THE BEST TRADITIONS OF NATO.
HE WISHED SIMPLY TO OBSERVE THAT HIS GOVERNMENT'S INFORMATION
CONFIRMED WHAT HABIB HAD SAID ABOUT THE SITUATION IN SAIGON; AND
HE ALSO WISHED TO ADD THAT JUST AS THE USSR MISSES NO CHANCE TO
CALL ATTENTION TO THE CHINESE DANGER, SIMILARLY, CHINA DOES THE
SAME ABOUT THE SOVIET DANGER.

40. DR. LAHN (FRG ASSISTANT STATE SECRETARY) NOTED THAT
FEDERAL CHANCELLOR SCHMIDT WAS ARRIVING IN PEKING ON THAT
VERY DAY. LAHN WISHED TO POINT OUT THAT AMONG PLACES SCHMIDT
WAS SCHEDULED TO VISIT ON HIS ORIGINAL PROGRAM WAS SHANGHAI.
HE SAID AT THE LAST MINUTE, PEKING HAD CANCELLED THE SHANGHAI
VISIT AND PROPOSED THAT SCHMIDT GO TO THE PROVINCE OF SINKIANG
AND ITS CAPITAL URUMCHI, WHICH IS A CENTER FOR CHINESE NUCLEAR
FACILITIES. LAHN SIMPLY WISHED TO POINT OUT THE CHANGE WAS
THE IDEA OF THE HOST AND AND NOT THE GUEST. HE ALSO INDICATED
THAT IF BY ANY WILD CHANCE THE CHINESE SHOULD SHOW SCHMIDT
CONFIDENTIAL

PAGE 02  NATO 05933  06 OF 06  311945Z

SOME NUCLEAR INSTALLATIONS, THE FRG WOULD, OF COURSE, REPORT
TO THE ALLIES.

41. LAHN THEN WISHED TO POSE A QUESTION CONCERNING THE RELATIONSHIP
BETWEEN SOUTH AND NORTH VIETNAM. HE WAS INTERESTED IN HABIB'S
SPECULATIONS THAT &quot;UNIFICATION&quot; MAY BE IMPOSED IN A VERY
SHORT TIME. NOTING THAT LE DUAN HAS RECENTLY BEEN TO
PEKING, MOSCOW AND A NUMBER OF EAST EUROPEAN CAPITALS,
AND NOTING THAT THE SOVIETS SEEM TO BE PREACHING THE THEME
OF UNIFICATION MORE STRONGLY THAN THE CHINESE, LAHN WONDERED
IF REUNIFICATION TOOK PLACE IN THE SHORT RUN, WOULD THIS
CAUSE A SUDDEN IMBALANCE IN THE EQUILIBRIUM OF WHICH HABIB
HAD SPOKEN? HABIB SAID THE US HAS HEARD RECURRING REPORTS
THAT PEKING PREFERS TO KEEP THE TWO VIETNAMS SEPARATE. THIS
SEEMS LIKE A LOGICAL POSITION FOR PEKING TO TAKE, AND IT MAY
BE THIS LOGIC RATHER THAN ANY BAIS IN FACT WHICH IS THE
SOURCE OF THE SERIES OF REPORTS. HABIB SAID THAT IT MAY BE
THAT A REUNIFIED VIETNAM WHICH HAS THE ABILITY TO LOOK
OUTWARD WILL BE A DISTURBING INFLUENCE IN EAST ASIA. HE
BELIEVES THIS PERSONALLY AND HE NOTED THAT VIETNAM'S NEIGHBORS
ALSO BELIEVE THIS. BUT HE CAUTIONED THAT THIS EVENTUALITY
WILL NOT COME ABOUT VERY QUICKLY. FURTHERMORE, PEKING MAY
REALIZE THAT IT CANNOT PREVENT REUNIFICATION EVEN IF IT
WISHED TO AND FOR THAT REASON MAY DECIDE NOT TO MAKE ANY
EFFORT TO PREVENT IT.

42. A/SYG PANSA CONCLUDED THE DISUCSSION, CALLING IT &quot;EXTREMELY
GOOD&quot;, ESPECIALLY IN THAT IT INVOLVED THE ALLIES IN THESE FAR
EAST QUESTIONS WHICH ARE NOT USUALLY WITHIN &quot;OUR SPHERE&quot;,
BUT WHICH ARE MATTERS RELATING TO THE COMMON INTERESTS OF THE ALLIES.
HE SAID THE MORNING CONSULTATION WAS IN HIW VIEW &quot;A GOOD OMEN&quot;
FOR FUTURE REINFORCED NAC CONSULTATIONS ON REGIONAL QUESTIONS.
HE COULD ONLY HOPE THAT SUCH FUTURE CONSULTATIONS WOULD BE AS
PROFITABLE AS THE ONE WHICH TOOK PLACE TODAY, AND WHICH WAS
VIVID EVIDENCE OF THE ALLIES PUTTING INTO PRACTICE THEIR RESOLVE
WITH REGARD TO CONSULTATIONS AS EXPRESSED IN PARA 11 OF THE OTTAWA
DECLARATION. PANSA THANKED ALL THE HIGH-LEVEL OFFICIALS WHO
HAD COME FROM CAPITALS AND ESPECIALLY AMBASSADOR HABIB, &quot;WHO
HAD COME THE LONGEST WAY&quot;.

43. PANSA THEN SAID IN ACCORD WITH COMMON PRACTICE, HE WOULD
CONFIDENTIAL

PAGE 03  NATO 05933  06 OF 06  311945Z

RPOPOSE THE NATO SPOKESMAN, ON AN IF-ASKED BASIS, TO DRAW ON THE
FOLLOWING GUIDANCE: &quot;AT TODAY'S REGULAR WEEKLY MEETING OF THE
NORTH ATLANTIC COUNCIL, ALLIED REPRESENTATIVES DISCUSSED THE
GENERAL SUBJECT OF EAST ASIA. THE PERMANENT REPRESENTATIVES
WERE JOINED BY SENIOR OFFICIALS FROM CAPITALS AS FOLLOWS:

BELGIUM - AMBASSAODR ANDRE WENDELEN
GERMANY - DR. LOTHAR LAHN, ASSISTANT STATE SECRETARY
ITALY - MINISTER MARCELLO SALIMEI
NETHERLANDS - MR. J. ROOKMAKER, DIRECTOR OF EASTERN AFFAIRS DEPARTMEN
T
UNITED KINGDOM - MR. P.J.E. MALE, ASSISTANT UNDER SECRETARY
OF STATE
UNITED STATES - MR. PHILIP C. HABIB, ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF
STATE FOR EAST ASIAN AND PACIFIC AFFAIRS

&quot;THIS EXCHANGE OF VIEWS ON EAST ASIA IS PART OF THE CONTINUOUS
PROCESS OF ALLIED POLITICAL CONSULTATION WHICH HAS ALWAYS
BEEN PART OF NATO ACITVITIES. THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS PROCESS
WAS CONFIRMED IN ARTICLE II OF THE OTTAWA DECLARATION IN
JUNE 1974, AND AFFIRMED ONCE MORE BY THE NATO HEADS OF
GOVERNMENT WHEN THEY MET IN BRUSSELS IN MAY 1975.&quot; THERE
WAS NO OBJECTION.

SUBJ: REINFORCED NAC ON THE FAR EAST, OCTOBER 29, 1975

SUMMARY: NAC CONSULTATION ON FAR EAST ON OCTOBER 29 WAS
REINFORCED BY SENIOR POLICY OFFICIALS FROM BELGIUM, FRG,
ITALY, NETHERLANDS, UK AND US. ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF STATE
HABIB (US) LED OFF DISCUSSION, COVERING GENERAL EAST ASIAN
DEVELOPMENTS IN THE SIX MONTHS SINCE THE FALL OF SAIGON. HE
SAID THE INITIAL APPREHENSION FOLLOWING THE FALL OF SAIGON
HAD DISSIPATED. THE SOUTHEAST ASIAN COUNTRIES ARE STILL CON-
CERNED WITH THE IMPACT OF HANOI'S SUCCESS ON THEIR SECURITY;
THEY ARE MOVING CLOSER TO THE NON-ALIGNED BLOC AND BEGINNING
TO DEVELOP ASEAN INTO A MORE MEANINGFUL REGIONAL ORGANIZATION.
AT THE SAME TIME, THEY CONTINUE TO RELY UPON THE US COMMIT-
MENT, WHICH WE HAVE REAFFIRMED. PRC RELATIONS WITH THE US
AND JAPAN ARE RELATIVELY GOOD, WHILE THOSE WITH THE SOVIETS
ARE COOL. THE INTERNAL SCENE IN CHINA IS STABLE; THE LINES
OF SUCCESSION ARE SET WITH THE CURRENT LEADERSHIP DISPLAYING
A COLLEGIAL CHARACTER. JAPAN-US RELATIONS ARE THE BEST THEY
HAVE EVER BEEN. JAPAN IS CLOSER TO PEKING THAN TO MOSCOW.
CONFIDENTIAL

PAGE 02  NATO 05933  01 OF 06  311750Z

THE SITUATION ON THE KOREAN PENINSULA REMAINS CALM FOR THE
TIME BEING, BUT PRESENTS THE GREATEST DANGER FOR POTENTIAL
CONFRONTATION. HABIB'S PRESENTATION WAS FOLLOWED BY A WIDE-
RANGING DISCUSSION INVOLVING PERMREPS AND VISITING OFFICIALS
FROM CAPITALS.
THIS REINFORCED NAC ON THE FAR EAST WAS GREETED WITH
ENTHUSIASM BY PERMREPS. MENZIES (CANADA) WELCOMED THE CON-
SULTATIONS AS &quot;USEFUL AND TIMELY&quot; AND PARTICULARLY BECAUSE
OF PARTICIPATION BY HIGH-LEVEL OFFICIALS FROM CAPITALS.
SIMILAR APPRECIATION WAS EXPRESSED BY KRAPF (FRG). CATALANO
(ITALY) SAID THE SESSION WAS ONE OF THE BEST ALLIANCE CON-
SULTATIONS HE COULD REMEMBER AND THAT MEETINGS OF THIS SORT
SHOULD BE AMONG THE BEST TRADITIONS OF NATO. ACTING SECRETARY
GENERAL PANSA SUMMED UP THE MEETING, CALLING IT &quot;EXTREMELY
GOOD&quot;, PROVIDING EVIDENCE OF THE ALLIES PUTTING INTO PRACTICE
THEIR RESOLVE WITH REGARD TO CONSULTATIONS AS EXPRESSED IN
PARA 11 OF THE OTTAWA DECLARATION. COMMENT: WE CONSIDER
REINFORCED NAC ON THE FAR EAST TO HAVE BEEN HIGHLY SUCCESSFUL
IN ENHANCING THE POLITICAL CONSULTATIVE PROCESS IN THE ALLIANCE
AND ALSO IN PROVIDING OUR 14 NATO ALLIES WITH A LUCID AND
FORCEFUL EXPOSE OF US POLICIES AND OBJECTIVES IN THIS HIGHLY
IMPORTANT REGION OF THE WORLD. END SUMMARY.

1. ACTING SECRETARY GENERAL PANSA OPENED REINFORCED NAC OF
OCTOBER 29 BY WELCOMING ATTENDANCE OF HIGH-LEVEL OFFICIALS
FROM BELGIUM (AMBASSADOR WENDELEN), FRG (ASSISTANT SECRETARY
LAHN), ITALY (MINISTER SALIMEI), NETHERLANDS (FE AFFAIRS
DIRECTOR ROOKMAKER), UK (ASSISTANT UNDER-SECRETARY MALD) AND
US (ASSISTANT SECRETARY HABIB). PANSA SAID THIS MEETING WOULD
FURTHER STRENGTHEN THE PROCESS OF POLITICAL CONSULTATION
WITHIN THE COUNCIL.

2. ASSISTANT SECRETARY HABIB (US) SAID THERE WAS A GREAT
DEAL OF APPREHENSION IN ASIA AFTER THE FALL OF SAIGON.
GENERALLY SPEAKING, SUCH APPREHENSION HAS ABATED. THE MAJOR
POWER BALANCE IN EAST ASIA REMAINS ESSENTIALLY UNCHANGED,
ALTHOUGH THERE ARE SEVERAL NEW PRESSURE POINTS. THE REACTION
OF THE REGION TO EVENTS IN INDOCHINA HAS BEEN MEASURED AND
TEMPERATE. COUNTRIES ARE MOTIVATED BY NATIONALISTIC ASPIRATIONS
AND ARE DETERMINED TO MAINTAIN THEIR INDEPENDENCE. THEY
ARE EVOLVING THEIR OWN POLICIES AND HAVE DEVELOPED A
CONFIDENTIAL

PAGE 03  NATO 05933  01 OF 06  311750Z

BETTER APPRECIATION OF THE SIGNIFICANCE OF SELF-RELIANCE AS
A FACTOR IN SECURITY MATTERS. HE SAID THERE IS GENERAL DESIRE
FOR CLOSER IDENTIFICATION WITH THE NON-ALIGNED BLOC. THIS
IS ESPECIALLY TRUE IN NON-COMMUNIST SOUTHEAST ASIA; SOME OF
THESE COUNTRIES WERE MEMBERS OF NON-ALIGNED IN THE PAST AND
THEY HAVE BROUGHT OTHERS ALONG. THERE IS A WIDE-SPREAD
REGIONAL VIEW THAT CONTINUED US PRESENCE AND INVOLVEMENT
IN THE AREA IS BENEFICIAL FOR ASIA.

3. HABIB DESCRIBED US REACTION TO THE INDOCHINA AFTERMATH
AS NOT SUBSTANTIAL. A DIVISIVE DOMESTIC POLITICAL ISSUE HAS
BEEN REMOVED. US INTENDS TO MAINTAIN MORE NORMAL INTERESTS
IN ASIA. THIS WILL INCLUDE CONTINUED FORWARD DEPLOYMENT OF
US FORCES IN ASIA INCLUDING SUBSIDIARY DEPLOYMENT OF FORCES
IN KOREA AND THAILAND, ALTHOUGH THE LATTER DEPLOYMENT WILL
END NEXT YEAR.

4. HABIB SAW CERTAIN RESTRAINTS ON MAJOR POWERS -- CHINA,
SOVIET UNION, JAPAN AND US -- AFTER THE FALL OF INDOCHINA.
ALL MAJOR POWERS RECOGNIZE THAT UNDER PRESENT CIRCUMSTANCES,
NO ONE POWER CAN ESTABLISH HEGEMONY IN THE AREA. THE OVER-
RIDING CHINESE PREOCCUPATION IS THREAT OF SOVIET HEGEMONY
IN ASIA. ALL MAJOR POWERS RECOGNIZE THAT IN THIS PERIOD,
IT IS IN OUR COMMON INTEREST TO ACT WITH MODERATION AND
RESTRAINT. THE SINO-SOVIET RIVALRY, THE US-JAPANESE ALLIANCE,
US AND JAPANESE ECONOMIC PREDOMINANCE IN ASIA, AND LIMITED
SOVIET ENTREE TO ASIAN SECURITY ARRANGEMENTS GENERALLY
CONTRIBUTE TO STABILITY. THESE FACTORS ARE NOT LIKELY TO
CHANGE SIGNIFICANTLY OVER THE SHORT TERM, AND PROBABLY NOT
OVER THE MEDIUM TERM AS WELL. EQUILIBRIUM COULD BE CHANGED
SIGNIFICANTLY IF THE SINO-SOVIET RIVALRY WERE DRASTICALLY
ALTERED OR IF RUSSIA ATTAINED MAJOR INFLUENCE IN ASIA, BUT
NEITHER APPEARS A LIKELY PROSPECT.

5. SMALLER COUNTRIES, ESPECIALLY IN SOUTHEAST ASIA, CAN
EXERCISE GREATER FLEXIBILITY AND MANEUVERABILITY IN SEEKING
NEW DIPLOMATIC INITIATIVES. THEY SEE USEFULNESS IN REGIONAL
GROUPINGS SUCH AS ASEAN. THERE WILL PROBABLY BE AN ASEAN
SUMMIT WITHIN THE NEXT FEW MONTHS. ASEAN IS BEGINNING TO GO
BEYOND GENERALITIES, INCLUDING PLANNING EXPANDED COORDIN-
ATION OF SECURITY EFFORTS. ASEAN IS SEEKING BETTER UNDER-
STANDING AND REALTIONS WITH COMMUNIST NEIGHBORS AND IS PAR-
TICULARLY CONCERNED ABOUT HANOI AS A SUB-REGIONAL POWER.
THEY ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THAILAND, WHICH IS REGARDED AS SICK
MAN OF ASIA. TWO COUNTRIES, THE PHILIPPINES AND THAILAND,
MOVED QUICKLY TO NORMALIZE RELATIONS WITH THE PRC. ASEAN IS
CONCERNED WITH THE IMPACT OF HANOI'S SUCCESS ON THEIR DOMESTIC
INSURGENTS' MOVEMENTS. THERE ARE A NUMBER OF INSURGENT
GROUPS IN BURMA. THREE DIFFERENT AREAS IN THAILAND AR
THREATENED. INSURGENTS IN MALAYSIA HAVE RECENTLY BECOME MORE
ACTIVE. THERE ARE TWO SUCH MOVEMENTS IN THE PHILIPPINES,
ONE MOSLEM AND ONE COMMUNIST. THERE IS ALSO AN INCIPIENT
MOVEMENT IN INDONESIA, SEPARATE FROM THE PROBLEM OF TIMOR.

6. HABIB SAID US-PRC RELATIONS ARE GOOD ALTHOUGH THEY ARE
CONFIDENTIAL

PAGE 02  NATO 05933  02 OF 06  311805Z

NOT YET FULLY NORMALIZED. THE PRC SEES US AS A COUNTER-
BALANCE AGAINST MOSCOW. THIS INTEREST IS STRONGER NOW TAN
AT THE BEGINNING OF US-PRC RELATIONSHIP. PEKING IS UNHAPPY
WITH DETENTE, AND MAKES ITS DISPLEASURE KNOWN AT EVERY OPPOR-
TUNITY BY EMPHASIZING THE DANGERS OF DETENTE. THE PRC CON-
TINUES TO HARP ON THEME THAT SOVIETS ARE FEINTING IN THE EAST
WHILE PREPARING TO STRIKE IN THE WEST.THEY CANNOT SEE THAT
THIS IS IRRELEVANT. THE PRC SEES US MILITARY PRESENCE ABROAD,
IN BOTH EUROPE AND ASIA, AS A NECESSARY COUNTERWEIGHT TO
SOVIET EXPANSIONISM. TAIWAN IS STILL THE MAIN OBSTACLE
PREVENTING FULL NORMALIZATION OF US-PRC RELATIONS. THE
PRC'S INSISTENCE ON THREE POINTS REGARDING TAIWAN -- ABRO-
GATION OF THE US-ROC DEFENSE TREATY, WITHDRAWAL OF US FORCES
AND BREAKING US-ROC RELATIONS -- ARE UNCHANGED. THE PRC IS
NOT, HOWEVER, PRESSING ON THIS ISSUE. PRESIDENT FORD WILL
VISIT PEKING WITHIN THE NEXT FEW WEEKS, BUT THIS TRIP WILL
INVOLVE MORE POLITICAL SYMBOLISM THAN CONCRETE RESULTS.

7. SINO-SOVIET RELATIONS REMAIN COOL. BORDER DISCUSSIONS
ARE IN A RECESS AND TRADE IS STAGNATING, WHILE THE RHETORICAL
BATTLE HAS GROWN SHARPER. PEKING SAYS MOSCOW IS THE
CHIEF THREAT TO WORLD PEACE AND SECURITY. THE SOVIETS AND
PRC COMPETE IN HANOI, PYONGYANG, TOKYO AND SOUTHEAST ASIA.

8. SINO-JAPANESE RELATIONS ARE RELATIVELY GOOD. THE CHINESE
CONTINUE TO INSIST ON THEIR ANTI-HEGEMONY CLAUSE IN ANY PEACE
TREATY WITH JAPAN. ALTHOUGH THIS WILL DELAY SIGNING OF A
TREATY, ONE WILL, IN THE END, BE SIGNED. THE PRC BACKS JAPAN
AGAINST MOSCOW ON THE NORTHERN TERRITORIES ISSUE. THE PRC
IS FOND OF SAYING, INCLUDING TO JAPANESE VISITORS, THAT US-
JAPANESE RELATIONS ARE MORE IMPORTANT AT THIS TIME THAN
JAPANESE-PRC RELATIONS. TOKYO'S RELATIONS ARE BETTER WITH
PEKING THAN WITH MOSCOW.

9. HABIB CHARACTERIZED THE INTERNAL SCENE IN CHINA AS
STESSING POLITICAL STABILITY, UNITY AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT.
CHOU EN-LAI IS ILL, AND FOR THIS REASON COULD NOT SEE SECRETARY
KISSINGER. MAO TSE-TUNG IS STILL ACTIVELY CONCERNED WITH
OVERALL POLICY AND FOREIGN AFFAIRS, ESPECIALLY RELATIONS WITH
MOSCOW. TENG HSIAO-P'ING IS SEEMINGLY IN CONFIDENT CONTROL.
THERE IS A COLLEGIAL CHARACTER TO CURRENT PRC LEADERSHIP.
CONFIDENTIAL

PAGE 03  NATO 05933  02 OF 06  311805Z

REHABILITATION OF SOME OF THOSE PURGED DURING THE CULTURAL
REVOLUTION INDICATES MOVEMENT TOWARD MAINTAINING THE BALANCE
WITHIN THE LEADERSHIP. THE SHUI HU CAMPAIGN HAS APPARENTLY
ENDED, REPLACED BY A CAMPAIGN TO INCREASE AGRICULTURAL PRO-
DUCTIVITY. ANOTHER IDEOLOGICAL CAMPAIGN APPEARS TO BE IN
THE OFFERING. THE LINES OF SUCCESSION APPEAR TO BE SET, BUT
IT IS NOT CLEAR WHETHER THE SUCCESSION WILL PERPETRATE COL-
LEGIAL LEADERSHIP.

10. HABIB SAID JAPANESE RELATIONS WITH THE US ARE THE BEST
THEY HAVE EVER BEEN. EFFECTS OF THE NIXON SHOCKS ARE CLEARLY
PAST. THE EMPORER'S VISIT TO THE US WAS SYMBOLIC OF EXCELLENT,
CLOSE BILATERAL RELATIONS. WE DO NOT HAVE PROBLEMS WITH
JAPAN IN THE OLD SENSE OF THE WORD. WE COOPERATE CLOSELY
WITH JAPAN ON ALL MATTERS, INCLUDING DEFENSE. WE ARE PREPARED
TO ACCOMMODATE TO THE PACE SET BY JAPAN, AND WE ARE NOT
PRESSING JAPAN TO EXPAND ITS DEFENSE FORCES SIGNIFICANTLY.
WE BELIEVE CONSTITUTIONAL, POLITICAL AND BUDGETARY CONSTRAINTS
WILL PROVIDE APPROPRIATE LIMITATIONS.

11. JAPAN'S RELATIONS WITH THE SOVIETS ARE NOT ALL THAT WARM.
THERE IS A JAPANESE TILT TOWARD CHINA. SOVIET PRESSURE
TACTICS REGARDING THE PRC HEGEMONY CLAUSE IN A FUTURE PEACE
TREATY AND A HARDENED SOVIET ATTITUDE TOWARD THE NORTHERN
TERRITORIES HAVE COOLED TOKYO-MOSCOW RELATIONS. JOINT ECONOMIC
ACTIVITIES WITH THE SOVIETS ARE MOVING SLOWLY.

12. TOKYO IS KEENLY ATTUNED TO DEVELOPMENTS IN ASIA, PAR-
TICULARLY ON THE KOREAN PENINSUAL AND IN SOUTHEAST ASIA.
JAPANESE RELATIONS WITH THE ROK HAVE IMPROVED. JAPAN IS ALSO
SEEKING TO DEFUSE TENSIONS ON THE KOREAN PENINSUAL BY TRYING
TO DRAW NORTH KOREA INTO MORE REASONABLE RELATIONSHIPS WITH
THE ROK AND EVEN WITH THE US. JAPAN'S INTEREST IN SOUTHEAST
ASIA IS PRIMARILY ECONOMIC. JAPAN ADJUSTED RELATIONS WITH
HANOI QUICKLY. THEY HAVE AN EMBASSY IN HANOI AND WILL PROVIDE
US$45 MILLION IN AID TO THE DRV OVER NEXT TWO YEARS.
JAPAN SEES ITSELF AS A BRIDGE BETWEEN HANOI AND THE US.

13. HABIB SAW THE NATURAL DIVERSITY OF THE REGION AS A SIG-
NIFICANT FACTOR IN THE POWER EQUILIBRIUM. OUR PREOCCUPATION,
AND THAT OF OTHERS, WITH INDOCHINA IS FINISHED. WHEN WE
CONFIDENTIAL

PAGE 04  NATO 05933  02 OF 06  311805Z

PREOCCUPIED HANOI'S ATTENTION THERE WAS LITTLE CONCERN IN
ASEAN. NOW THAT THIS PERIOD IS FINISHED, IT HAS CREATED
PROBLEMS FOR ASEAN. THE COUNTRIES OF THIS REGION SEE ECON-
OMIC DEVELOPMENT AND SECURITY GOING HAND IN HAND. THEY SEE
THEIR DEPENDENCE UPON A US COMMITMENT AND ARE CONCERNED
WHETHER WE WILL FULFILL THAT COMMITMENT. WE HAVE TRIED TO
REASSURE THESE COUNTRIES OF THE CONSTANCY AND CHARACTER OF
OUR COMMITMENT. THEREFORE WE HAVE NOT WITHDRAWN ANY OF OUR
FORCES PRECIPITOUSLY, EVEN FROM THAILAND. THE DIVERSITY OF
THE REGION, FORCES OF NATIONALISM, AND THE FAR-RANGING NATURE
OF SINO-SOVIET RIVALRY ARE FACTORS WHICH MAINTAIN THE
EQUILIBRIUM OF POWER IN ASIA. THESE PUT A PREMIUM ON FLEXI-
BILITY AND ON THE NEED TO WORK TO REDUCE TENSIONS AND CON-
FRONTATIONS. THIS EQUILIBRIUM OF THE POWER DYNAMIC MAY
NOT PREVAIL, BUT IT WIDENS THE OPPORTUNITY TO AVOID CONFRON-
TATION.

14. DR. ROOKMAKER (NETHERLANDS EXPERT) DISCUSSED THE
DEVELOPMENT OF ASEAN COUNTRIES' POLICIES AND THEIR IMPLICATIONS
FOR WESTERN APPROACH TO THE AREA. HE EMPHASIZED THAT SINCE THE
END OF THE VIETNAM CONFLICT ASEAN COUNTRIES HAVE RECOGNIZED
THAT THEY CANNOT FIGHT COMMUNISM WITH WEAPONS AND MUST CONCENTRATE
ON ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT PARTICULARLY FOR THE POORER SECTORS
OF THEIR SOCIETIES. HE SAID ASEAN COUNTRIES HAVE ADOPTED A
CONSTRUCTIVE POLICY TOWARD INDOCHINA AND HOPE EVENTUALLY THAT
THEIR OWN CONCEPT OF NEUTRALISM CAN BE EXTENDED TO EMBRACE
INDOCHINA. HE BELIEVED WESTERN COUNTRIES SHOULD TAKE ASEAN
ASPIRATIONS INTO ACCOUNT AND SHOULD NOT DISCRIMINATE AGAINST
INDOCHINA IN A WAY WHICH WOULD INHIBIT THE ACHIEVEMENT OF ASEAN'S
OBJECTIVES. FOR EXAMPLE, COOPERATION BETWEEN ASEAN AND INDOCHINA
WOULD BE FACILITATED IF WESTERN AID TO THE AREA WAS NOT DIRECTED
EXCLUSIVELY TO ASEAN COUNTRIES.

15. ERALP (TURKEY) ASKED HABIB TO COMMENT ON INTERNAL DEVELOPMENTS
IN CAMBODIA AND THE RELATIONSHIP OF CAMBODIA TO HANOI,
CHINA, AND THE USSR. HABIB RECALLED THAT WHEN PHNOM PENH
FELL, THE KHMER ROUGE EMPTIED PHNOM PENH AS WELL AS OTHER
CAMBODIAN CITIES AND ELIMINATED ALL OFFICIALS OF ANY STATURE.
CONFIDENTIAL

PAGE 02  NATO 05933  03 OF 06  311826Z

THE YOUND AND THE OLD SUFFERED MOST IN THIS OPERATION,
DURING WHICH THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE LOST THEIR LIVES. THE KHMER
ROUGE APPARENTLY WANTED TO BREAK DOWN THE EXISTING URBAN
STRUCTURE WHICH HAD CONTROLLED THE COUNTRY UNDER SIHANOUK
AND TO RULE THROUGH THE PARTY STRUCTURE OF THE KHMER ROUGE.
THIS STRUCTIRE REMAINS SHADOWY AND IT IS NOT YET POSSIBLE TO
DETERMINE WHO IS ON TOP.

16. AS TO CAMBODIA'S EXTERNAL RELATIONS, HABIB NOTED EVIDENCE
OF CONTINUING DISAGREEMENTS WITH HANOI. THERE HAD BEEN
FIGHTING OVER OFF-SHORE ISLANDS AND ENGAGEMENTS IN BORDER
AREAS. WHILE HANOI HAD WON THESE ENCOUNTERS, IT HAD NOT
ALWAYS DONE SO EASILY AND IN SOME INSTANCES NEEDED TO EMPLOY
ITS AIR FORCE. THERE WERE CONTACTS BETWEEN CAMBODIA AND
NORTH VIETNAMESE OFFICIALS AIMED AT SETTLING BORDER CONFLICTS,
BTU THESE EFFORTS HAD NOT BEEN VERY SUCCESSFUL. HABIB NOTED
THAT THE PRINCIPAL EXTERNAL INFLUENCE IN CAMBODIA AT PRESENT
IS PEKING. THE KHMER ROUGE HAVE NOT FORGOTTEN SOVIET SUPPORT
FOR LON NOL AND THE SOVIETS HAVE BEEN EFFECTIVELY EXLUDED
FROM CAMBODIA. IN THE NEAR FUTURE, THE KHMER ROUGE APPARENTLY
INTEND TO ALLOW ONLY THREE COUNTRIES, WHICH HELPED THEM
DURING THEIR STRUGGLE, TO BE REPRESENTED IN PHNOM PENH;
NORTH VIETNAM, CHINA, AND NORTH KOREA. HABIB OBSERVED THAT
THE RIVALRY BETWEEN HANOI AND PEKING IN CAMBODIA IS NOT
ENTIRELY CLEAR. HOWEVER, ONE CAN ARGUE THAT PEKING LOOKS ON
CAMBODIA AS A BUFFER STATE THAT COULD LIMIT HANOI'S SUBREGIONAL
HEGEMONY, WHICH PEKING FEARS MIGHT SERVE AS A SURROGATE
FOR SOVIET INFLUENCE IN THE AREA. HABIB CONCLUDED
THAT OUR INFORMATION INDICATES THE KHMER ROUGE DO NOT INTEND
TO PERMIT ANY WESTERN EMBASSIES IN CAMBODIA FOR SOME TIME.
IT MAY BE A YEAR OR TWO BEFORE THE WEST BEGINS TO DEVELOP
SOME INFLUENCE IN CAMBODIA.

17. BUSCH (NORWAY) PROVIDED THE FOLLOWING INDICATIONS OF
CAMBODIAN POLICIES PICKED UP RECENTLY BY NORWEGIAN OFFICIALS:
A CAMBODIAN IN CONTACT WITH SIHANOUK SAID THE PRINCE IS NEEDED
AS A NATIONAL SYMBOL IN CAMBODIA BUT WOULD NOT BE GIVEN ANY
INTERNAL POWER. SIHANOUK WOULD RETURN TO CAMBODIA AT THE END
OF DECEMBER AND WOULD REMAIN THERE FOR SOME SIX MONTHS. AN
EASTERN EUROPEAN CONTACT TOLD THE NORWEGIANS THE KHMER ROUGE
INTEND TO PERMIT EIGHT ADDITIONAL COUNTRIES TO ESTABLISH A
CONFIDENTIAL

PAGE 03  NATO 05933  03 OF 06  311826Z

DIPLOMATIC PRESENCE IN CAMBODIA: ALGERIA, ALBANIA, ROMANIA,
YUGOSLAVIA, EGYPT, LAOS, MAURITANIA, AND SOUTH VIETNAM.
SWEDEN MAY ACCREDIT A DIPLOMATIC REPRESENTATIVE TO CAMBODIA
BY THE END OF THIS YEAR. THE KHMER ROUGE MAY BEGIN TO ADMIT
CORRESPONDENTS INTO CAMBODIA BY THE BEGINNING OF 1976. BUSCH
ALSO MENTIONED THAT NORWEGIAN CONTACTS HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO
ESTABLISH ANY POSITIVE CONFIRMATION THAT NORTH VIETNAM IS
PROVIDING MILITARY ASSISTANCE TO THAI INSURGENTS THROUGH
CAMBODIA.

18. ASSISTNAT UNDER-SECRETARY MALE (UK EXPERT) AGREED WITH
HABIB'S PRESENTATION AND SAID THE UK APPROACHES THE REGION
IN TERMS OF THE UK DESIRE FOR STABILITY IN THE AREA. HE
NOTED THAT CHINESE-SOVIET COMPETITION HAS A DEFINITE EFFECT
ON DEVELOPMENTS IN SOUTHEAST ASIA. ON THE BASIS OF BRITISH
EXPERIENCE, HE CONFIRMED THAT THE CINESE ARE EMPHASIZING
THE DANGERS OF DETENTE TO WESTERN VISITORS. TENG HSIAO-P'ING
MADE THIS CLEAR TO HEATH AS DID MAO IN EVEN STARKER TERMS.
UK POLICY TOWARD CHINA AIRMS TO DO WHAT IS POSSIBLE TO BRING
CHINA INTO THE BROADER WORLD. UK RELATIONS WITH THE PRC
ARE GOOD AS IS EVIDENCED BY THE LACK OF ANY UNCOMFORTABLE
CHINESE INTERVENTIONS IN HONG KONG. BRITISH INTEREST TO A
CONSIDERABLE DEGREE FOCUSES ON HONG KONG WHERE CHINA OBVIOUSLY
COULD MAKE TROUBLE IF IT WISHED TO.

19. MALE SAID THE BRITISH REGARD THE CURRENT KOREAN SITUATION
AS &quot;SAFE&quot;, PARTICULARLY SINCE KIM IL-SONG WAS REBUFFED
IN PEKING WHEN HE SOUGHT SUPPORT FOR A FORWARD POLICY AFTER
THE FALL OF SAIGON. AS TO ASEAN, THE BRITISH REGARD THIS AS
A LOCALLY GROWN ORGANIZATION AND THUS ONE WHICH HAS A GOOD
INTERNATIONAL APPEARANCE. IT APPEARS TO BE AN ORGANIZATION
WITH A LONG-TERM POTENTIAL, BUT WITHOUT IMMEDIATE EFFICACY.
THE BRITISH ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE PROGRESS OF THE INSUGENCIES
IN THAILAND AND MALAYSIA.

20. KILLICK (UK) NOTED WITH INTEREST HABIB'S REPORT THAT
DURING THEIR VISIT TO PEKING, US OFFICIALS HAD TOLD THE
CHINESE THAT IT WAS IRRELEVANT WHETHER THE USSR WAS, AS THE
CHINESE MAINTAIN, FEINTING TO THE EAST WHILE ATTACKING TO
THE WEST. KILLICK AGREED THAT THE CHINESE POSITION MIGHT
BE IRRELEVANT IN A GEOPHYSICAL OR STRATEGIC SENSE. HOWEVER,
CONFIDENTIAL

PAGE 04  NATO 05933  03 OF 06  311826Z

HE BELIEVED THE US ATTITUDE WAS RELEVANT IN TERMS OF
US SECURITY COMMITMENTS. HE ASKED WHETHER HE WAS CORRECT
IN INTERPRETING THE US COMMENTS TO MEAN THAT THE US WOULD
NOT STAND IDLY BY IF THE SOVIETS MOVED AGAINST THE EAST.
HABIB SAID KILLICK WAS CORRECT. KILLICK'S ANALYSIS WAS
PRESCIENT: THAT WAS PRECISLY WHAT SECRETARY KISSINGER
MEANT TO CONVEY. THE US WOULD OPPOSE EFFORTS TO ACHIEVE
HEGEMONY IN THE EAST OR IN THE WEST. HABIB EMPHASIZED THAT
IT WAS NOT FOR HIM TO SAY HOW THE US WOULD OPPOSE MOVES
TOWARD HEGEMONY IN THE EAST. ANY SUCH MOVES WOULD NATURALLY
RAISE SERIOUS ISSUES WHICH WOULD HAVE TO BE CONSIDERED
AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF THE US GOVERNMENT.

21. SPEAKING TO MALE'S COMMENTS ON KOREA, HABIB SAID THE
US GENERALLY AGREES THAT THE SITUATION IS CURRENTLY &quot;SAFE&quot;
IN THAT THERE IS NO INDICATION THAT HOSTILITIES MIGHT BREAK
OUT IN THE NEAR FUTURE. HE EMPHASIZED, HOWEVER, THAT
KOREA IS ONE AREA IN EAST ASIA WHERE MISCALCULATION COULD
LEAD TO CONFLICT INVOLVING THE MAJOR POWERS, INCLUDING THE
US, WHICH CONTINUES TO MAINTAIN 40,000 TROOPS IN KOREA.
HABIB AGREED, AS WELL, THAT THE CHINESE WITHHELD THE SUPPORT
WHICH KIM SOUGHT IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING THE END OF THE
VIETNAM CONFLICT. HE NOTED, HOWEVER, THAT THE UNITED STATES
ALSO MADE IT CLEAR IN UNMISTAKEABLE TERMS THAT WE WOULD NOT
PERMIT KIM TO CARRY OUT ADVENTURES IN SOUTH KOREA. WE BELIEVE
KIM GOT THE MESSAGE.

C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 4 OF 6 USNATO 5933

22. HABIB SAID NORTH KOREA'S CURRENT POLICY APPEARED AIMED
AT A) WEAKENING THE INTERNATIONAL POSITION OF SOUTH KOREA,
B) ACHIEVING US WITHDRAWAL FROM SOUTH KOREA, AND C) AWAITING
INTERNAL CONTRADICTIONS IN SOUTH KOREA WHICH NORTH KOREA
COULD EXPLOIT. HABIB SAID THESE OBJECTIVES ARE REFLECTED IN
NORTH KOREAN TACTICS AT THE UN WHICH ARE CLEARLY DIRECTED
NOT ONLY AT BREAKING DOWN INTERNATIONAL SUPPORT FOR SOUTH
KOREA, BUT ALSO AGAINST THE UNITED STATES AND ITS POLICIES
TOWARD SOUTH KOREA. HABIB WAS GLAD TO SEE THAT OUR EUROPEAN
ALLIES APPEAR GENERALLY TO RECOGNIZE NORTH KOREA'S OBJECTIVES
AND THAT THEY OPPOSE THE UNFRIENDLY RESOLUTION ON KOREA AND
SUPPORT THE FRIENDLY RESOLUTION. HE STRESSED THE IMPORTANCE
OF MAINTAINING A COHESIVE WESTERN EFFORT IN THIS REGARD
BECAUSE THERE WOULD BE A REAL PROSPECT OF SERIOUS TROUBLE
IN EAST ASIA IF US SUPPORT FOR SOUTH KOREA WAS WITHDRAWN,
IF SOUTH KOREA WERE WEAKENED INTERNALLY, OR IF SOUTH KOREA
WAS CUT OFF FROM OTHER INTERNATIONAL SUPPORT.

23. DE STAERCKE (BELGIUM) ASKED HABIB TO COMMENT ON A) THE
DISSOLUTION OF SEATO AND HIS OBSERVATION THAT THE US STILL
RETAINS A COMMITMENT, AND B) THE PARADOX OF CHINESE POLICY
CONFIDENTIAL

PAGE 02  NATO 05933  04 OF 06  311913Z

WHICH URGES THE WEST TO PROTECT ITSELF AGAINST THE USSR, BUT
ENCOURAGES DEVELOPMENTS WHICH TEND TO UNDERMINE THE POWER OF
THE WEST.

24. HABIB POINTED OUT THAT, AT THE INSISTENCE OF THE
PHILIPPINES, SEATO WOULD DISAPPEAR OVER A TWO-YEAR PERIOD.
MANILA HAS A BILATERAL DEFENSE ARRANGEMENT WITHTHE UNITED
STATES AND THUS DOES NOT DEPEND ON SEATO. THAILAND DID NOT
HAVE SIMILAR ARRANGEMENTS WITH THE UNITED STATES AND HAD
WITHER WANTED SEATO RETAINED OR, AT A MINIMUM, THAT THE PROVISIONS
OF THE MANILA PACT REMAIN VALID. ACCORDINGLY, THE
PROVISIONS OF THE MANILA TREATY AS WELL AS THOSE OF THE RUSH-
THANAT EXCHANGE, WHICH FURTHER DEFINES THE US-THAI RELATIONSHIP,
REMAIN IN FORCE. THE US DID NOT ATTEMPT TO FORCE
DECISIONS ONE WAY OR THE OTHER ON THE RETENTION OF SEATO,
PREFERRING TO LET THE ASIANS DECIDE THE ISSUE.

25. RESPONDING TO THE QUESTION OF PRC INVOLVEMENT IN THE
THIRD WORLD, HABIB NOTED SOME CHINESE ACTIVITY IN AFRICA,
MOST RECENTLY IN ANGOLA, BUT SAID THE CHINESE DO NOT HAVE
THE ECONOMIC OR POLITICAL POWER TO PROJECT INTO THE THIRD
WORLD. CHINA CAN BE EXPECTED, HOWEVER, TO SUPPORT CAUSES
IN THIRD WORLD FORA THAT ARE INIMICAL TO SOVIET INTERESTS.
MOREOVER, THE CHINESE WILL INSIST THAT THEY ARE PART OF THE
THIRD WORLD, THOUGH MANY THIRD WORLD COUNTRIES WOULD QUESTION
THAT ASSERTION. GENERALLY SPEAKING, CHINA CANNOT BE EXPECTED
TO BE VERY ACTIVE OUTSIDE OF ITS OWN BOUNDARIES EXCEPT WHERE
SOVIET INTERESTS ARE CONCERNED. THE USSR IS THE &quot;BE-ALL,
END-ALL OF CHINESE ENMITY&quot; AND PEKING CAN THUS BE COUNTED
UPON TO ATTEMPT TO FRUSTRATE THE SOVIETS WHEREVER AND WHEN-
EVER THEY CAN.

26 FRG PERMREP KRAP THANKED HABIB FOR HIS ILLUMINATING
AND CONCISE PRESENTATION. HE AGREED THAT KOREA IS POTENTIALLY
THE MOST DANGEROUS AREA IN THE FAR EAST. RECALLING
HIS OWN EXTENSIVE EXPERIENCE IN JAPAN, KRAPF NOTED THAT THE
JAPANESE HAD NEVER FELT PARTICULARLY THREATENED BY CHINA OR
THE SOVIET UNION, BUT FEARED INVOLVEMENT IN A POSSIBLE KOREAN
CONFLICT. JAPAN THUS IS WORRIED ABOUT POSSIBLE UNWISE
INITIATIVES TAKEN BY THE SOUTH KOREANS ACTING ON THE PREMISE
THAT THEY ARE MILITARILY SUPERIOR TO THE NORTH KOREANS.
CONFIDENTIAL

PAGE 03  NATO 05933  04 OF 06  311913Z

KRAPF NOTED THAT THE US SEEMED TO ACCEPT THE SLOW PACE OF
JAPAN'S DEFENSE BUILDUP. DOES THAT PACE CARRYWITH IT THE
INFERENCE THAT JAPAN NO LONGER FEELS A STRONG DEFENSE
NECESSARY BECAUSE IT SEES LESS RISK OF A NEW KOREAN CONFLICT?

27. HABIB REPLIED THAT JAPAN SAW KOREAN DEFENSE AS PRIMARILY
A US RESPONSIBILITY. WHILE REALIZING THAT KOREAN SECURITY
IS IMPORTNAT TO THEIR OWN, THE JAPANESE BELIEVE THE US WILL
DEFEND SOUTH KOREA. ALTHOUGH JAPAN CAN DO NOTHING MILITARILY
IN KOREA, IT CAN PROVIDE ECONOMIC ASSISTANCE, JAPAN AGREES
WITH THE US THAT THERE IS NO IMMEDIATE PROSPECT OF KOREAN
HOSTILITIES. THE JAPANESE FULLY APPRECIATE, HOWEVER, THE
MEANING OF THE LINE DIVIDING THE TWO KOREAS AND THE FACT THAT
THERE ARE ONE MILLION MEN UNDER ARMS FACING EACH OTHER ACROSS
THAT LINE WITH INCREASINGLY MORE MODERN WEAPONS. MOREOVER,
THE JAPANESE RECOGNIZE NORTH KOREA AS PERHAPS THE MOST PUGNACIOUS
COMMUNIST POWER -- ONE THAT MAY BE EVEN MORE ISOLATED
THAN ALBANIA -- WHERE THE CULT OF THE INDIVIDUAL IS CARRIED
TO THE EXTREME AND WHERE IRRATIONAL ACTS MIGHT BE POSSIBLE.
JAPAN CLEARLY HOPES THAT THE KOREAN PROBLEM CAN BE ACCOMMODATED
AND PERMANENTLY DEFUSED OVER TIME. IN THE MEANTIME, TOKYO
WARNS THE US ABOUT THE KOREAN SITUATION AND URGES THAT US
FORCES NOT BE REDUCED. A FURTHER RESTRAINING FACTOR
IS THE FACT THAT NORTH
KOREA KNOWS THAT IT COULD NOT EARILY
ATTACK THE SOUTH.

28. AMBASSADOR KRAPF NOTED JAPAN'S AWARENESS THAT WHILE IT
COULD NOT SEND TROOPS TO KOREA, IT COULD BECOME INVOLVED
IN A KOREAN CONFLICT THROUGH US USE OF ITS BASES IN JAPAN.
HABIB REPLIED THAT JAPAN HAD GUARANTEED CONTINUED US USE OF
ITS JAPANESE BASES AND FULLY RECOGNIZES THAT IT WOULD
BE EXTREMELY DIFFICULT FOR THE US TO FIGHT IN KOREA WITHOUT
BASES IN JAPAN.

29. CANADIAN PERMREP MENZIES WELCOMED THE FAR EASTERN CONSULTATION
AS USEFUL AND TIMELY. HE PARTICULALY WELCOMED ASSISTANT
SECRETARY HABIB AND EXPERTS FROM OTHER ALLIED CAPITALS, AND
EXPRESSED REGRET THAT A CANADIAN EXPERT COULD NOT BE PRESENT.
REFERRING TO CANADA'S (AND THEREFORE TO NATO'S) 2400-MILE
FRONTIER ON THE PACIFIC, MENZIES NOTED ACTIVE CANADIAN INTEREST
CONFIDENTIAL

PAGE 04  NATO 05933  04 OF 06  311913Z

IN PACIFIC DEVELOPMENTS EVEN THOUGH CANADA CAN TAKE SHELTER
BEHIND THE UNITED STATES' PACIFIC DEFENSE EFFORT. CANADA'S
ROLE IN THE AREA HAD BEEN LIMITED TO PEACEKEEPING BOTH IN KOREA
AND, WITH A SOMEWHAT LESS SALUTARY RESULT, IN VIETNAM.
CANADA APPRECIATED US EFFORTS IN THE PACIFIC, THOUGH SOMETIMES
IN THE PAST OTTAWA THOUGHT THE US WAS OVEREXTENDED IN THE AREA
AND PERHAPS OVERLY HOSTILE TO THE PRC. ALTOGETHER, THE GOC FOUND
RECENT POST-VIETNAM ADJUSTMENTS IN US ASIAN POLICY MUCH MORE
PALATABLE AND SATISFACTORY. CANADA NOW AGREED WITH US ASIAN
POLICY.

C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 5 OF 6 USNATO 5933

30. MENZIES CHARACTERIZED THE THEME OF THE NAC CONSULTATION
AS THE SEARCH FOR STABILITY IN THE PACIFIC AREA. MANY NATO
COUNTRIES HAVE INTERESTS IN ASIA -- AN AREA WHICH PRESENTLY
HAS NO REGIONAL IDENTITY, AND WHERE SOME POWER MAY TRY TO
EXPLOIT THE POST-VIETNAM SITUATION DESPITE US ASSURANCES OF
CONTINUING SUPPORT FOR EXISTING RELATIONSHIPS IN THE AREA.
WHILE IT APPEARED THAT THE ASIAN MAINLAND HAS NO RESOURCES
IN WHICH NATO COUNTRIES HAD A DIRECT INTEREST, THIS WAS NOT
TRUE IN THE CASE OF INSULAR ASIA WITH THE OIL AND MINERAL
RESOURCES OF INDONESIA, THE MINERAL WEALTH OF THE PHILIPPINES,
AND THE ENORMOUS MINERAL DEPOSITS OF AUSTRALIA AND PAPUA-NEW
GUINEA. THE ALLIES MIGHT APPROPRIATELY ASK THEMSELVES
IF THEY ARE PAYING ENOUGH ATTENTIION TO NAVAL DEVELOPMENTS
IN THE PACIFIC. NATO'S NAVAL ADVISORS TALK FREQUENTLY
ABOUT PROTECTING THE VITAL TRADE ROUTES IN THE INDIAN
AND ATLANTIC OCEANS. THEY SHOULD ALSO BE CONSCIOUS
THAT THE TRADE ROUTES SUSTAINING JAPAN WERE SIMILARLY ESSEN-
TIAL GIVEN JAPAN'S ECONOMIC IMPORTANCE AND THE REQUIREMENT
THAT IT NOT BE FORCED TO CHOOSE BETWEEN CHINA OR THE SOVIET
UNION.

CONFIDENTIAL

PAGE 02  NATO 05933  05 OF 06  311928Z

31. RAISING A SERIES OF QUESTIONS, MENZIES ASKED FIRST IF
JAPAN'S RELUCTANCE TO SUPPORT SOUTH KOREA MILITARILY MEANT
THAT JAPAN MIGHT BE PREAPRED TO MAKE A NAVAL DEFENSE CONTRI-
BUTION, PERHAPS IN ANTI-SUBMARINE WARFARE, IN DISTANT AREAS
AS FAR SOUTH AS SINGAPORE. NOTING HABIB'S STATEMENT OF US
INTEREST IN MAINTAINING THE BALANCE OF POWER BETWEEN CHINA
AND THE USSR, MENZIES SAID HE FOUND IT DIFFICULT TO CONCEIVE
OF A US STRATEGIC RESPONSE ON CHINA'S BEHALF WERE THE
SOVIETS TO LAUNCH A PRE-EMPTIVE STRIKE ON CHINESE STRATEGIC
NUCLEAR INSTALLATIONS. MENZIES SAID HE COULD PERSONALLY
UNDERSTAND US SUPPORT FOR CHINA IN SUCH A SITUATION, BUT ONLY
BY MEANS SHORT OF DIRECT MILITARY INTERVENTION. HE COULD
NOT CONCEIVE OF DIRECT US CONVENTIONAL INVOLVEMENT IN A
BORDER SCUFFLE ALONG THE LONG SINO-SOVIET FRONTIER. MENZIES
ASKED, THEREFORE, HOW THE US MIGHT USE ITS &quot;STRATEGIC NUCLEAR
UMBRELLA&quot; IN THE ABOVE CONTEXT. IN THE EVENT OF SINO-SOVIET
HOSTILITIES, MENZIES ASSUMED THAT MOST COUNTRIES WOULD &quot;THANK
GOD&quot; THAT THEY ARE NOT CAUGHT BETWEEN THE TWO ANTAGONISTS
LIKE CANADA IS BETWEEN THE US AND THE USSR.

32. MENZIES ALSO ASKED FRENCH PERMREP DE ROSE ABOUT THE
MAINTANANCE OF FRENCH CULTURAL INFLUENCE IN INDOCHINA AFTER
THE COMMUNIST ASSUMPTION OF POWER IN THOSE STATES. MENZIES
NOTED THAT ONLY THREE COUNTRIES NOW MAINTAIN DIPLOMATIC
RELATIONS WITH CAMBODIA. IN HIS PERSONAL VIEW, FRENCH
INFLUENCE IN INDOCHINA HAD ALWAYS BEEN STRONG AND WOULD NOT
BE EASILY ERASED FROM THE AREA. HE WONDERED, THEREFORE, IF
AMBASSADOR DE ROSE COULD COMMENT ON FRENCH RELATIONS WITH
NORTH AND SOUTH VIETNAM AND ON CAMBODIA. (DE ROSE DID NOT
RESPOND).

33. REFERRING TO MENZIES' COMMENT ABOUT NAVAL DEVELOPMENTS
IN THE PACIFIC, PANSA NOTED AN OCTOBER 29 AFP REPORT THAT
THE SOVIET PACIFIC FLEET WAS CURRENTLY &quot;TWICE AS IMPORTANT&quot;
AS THE US SEVENTH FLEET.

34. CONCERNING JAPANESE &quot;OVERSEAS DEPLOYMENT&quot;, HABIB
RESPONDED THAT THE BASIC JAPANESE POSTURE IS IN DEFENSE OF
THE HOMELAND ISLANDS. SOME YEARS AGO, THERE WAS TALK OF
EXPANDING THEIR CAPABILITY, BUT THIS HAS BEEN DROPPED. FOR
THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE, JAPAN WILL BE DEPLOYED WITHIN THE
CONFIDENTIAL

PAGE 03  NATO 05933  05 OF 06  311928Z

IMMEDIATE AREA, I.E., WITHIN 1,000 MILES OF THE HOMELAND
ISLANDS AND WITH A MAJOR EMPHASIS ON ANTI-SUBMARINE WARFARE.

35. CONCERNING THE QUESTION OF STRATEGY, HABIB REPEATED THAT
GENERALLY SPEAKING, THE UNITED STATES WOULD OPPOSE ANY MOVE
BY THE SOVIETS TO IMPOSE BY FORCE RPT FORCE ITS PRESENCE
IN EAST ASIA. AS TO AMBASSADOR MENZIES' THEORETICAL QUESTION,
HABIB COULD ONLY REPEAT THAT THE MEANS WHICH WOULD BE EMPLOYED
TOWARD THIS END WOULD DEPEND ON THE CIRCUMSTANCES.

36. SVART (DENMARK) WISHED TO CLARIFY THAT THE FAILURE OF
A DANISH FAR EAST EXPERT TO BE IN ATTENDANCE SHOULD NOT BE
TAKEN AS SUGGESTING A LACK OF INTEREST IN THIS CONSULTATION
OR IN THE FAR EAST. HE SAID IT WAS SIMPLY A QUESTION OF THE
THINNESS OF DANISH MFA RESOURCES. AS A MEASURE OF HIS
COUNTRY'S INTEREST, SVART CALLED ATTENTION TO THE VISIT WHICH
FONMIN ANDERSON HAS JUST BEGUN TO SEVERAL COUNTRIES IN THE
FAR EAST. TURNING TO HIS QUESTIONS, SVART ASKED WHETHER
DURING HABIB'S RECENT TRAVELS HE HAD ENCOUNTERED ANY NEW
INDICATIONS OF SOVIET EFFORTS IN EAST ASIA ALONG THE LINES
OF THEIR PROPOSAL FOR AN ASIAN COLLECTIVE SECURITY PACT
OR A WORLD-WIDE CONFERENCE OF COMMUNIST PARTIES. SECONDLY,
SVART ASKED WHAT IS GOING ON IN SAIGON AT THE PRESENT TIME.

37. HABIB OBSERVED THAT AS A GENERAL PROPOSITION, ALL THE
ASIANS HE MET TENDED TO LOOK WITH &quot;CONCERN&quot; ON THE PEOPLE'S
REPUBLIC AND THE HANOI REGIME. IN CONTRAST, THEY WOULD EXPRESS
&quot;FEAR&quot; OF SOVIET POWER AND INTENTIONS. THROUGHOUT THE EAST
ASIAN ARCH, THIS PHENOMENON OF PREJUDICE, WELL-BASED IN
HISTORY OF COURSE, SEEMED TO PREVAIL. CONCERNING SAIGON,
HABIB SAID THE UNITED STATES NEVER DOUBTED THAT HANOI RAN
THE COMMUNIST MOVEMENT IN SOUTH VIETNAM. ON THE BASIS OF
WHAT THE UNITED STATES HAS BEEN ABLE TO PICK UP FROM VARIOUS
SOURCES ABOUT WHAT IS GOING ON IN SAIGON, THIS VIEWPOINT
HAS BEEN CONFIRMED. A RESTRUCTURING OF THE SOCIETY RIGHT
DOWN TO THE VILLAGE LEVEL SEEMS TO BE IN PROGRESS. THERE IS
NO REAL GOVERNMENT IN THE SOUTH INDEPENDENT OF THE HANOI
STRUCTURE. IN FACT, THERE IS VERY LITTLE PRETENSE OF AN
INDEPENDENT GOVERNMENT IN THE SOUTH. THE PRG, WHICH WAS
NEVER ANYTHING MORE THAN A SHADOW GOVERNMENT, DOES NOT EVEN
FUNCTION IN SAIGON, WHICH IS RUN BY A GENERAL. THE NUMBER ONE
CONFIDENTIAL

PAGE 04  NATO 05933  05 OF 06  311928Z

MAN IN THE SOUTH IS MR. PHAM HUNG, A MEMBER OF THE NORTH
VIETNAMESE POLITBURO, AND HE CONTINUES AS NUMBER ONE JUST
AS HE HAS BEEN SINCE THE '60S, WHEN HIS PREDECESSOR WAS KILLED
IN A B-52 RAID. FURTHERMORE, THERE SEEMS TO BE AN INCREASE
OF NORTH VIETNAMESE-TRAINED SOUTHERN CADRE RETURNING TO THE
SOUTH AFTER PERIODS OF TRAINING IN NORTH VIETNAM. HABIB
SAID HIS PERSONAL OPINION IS THAT REUNIFICATION WILL COME
ABOUT SOONER RATHER THAN LATER, EVEN BEFORE THE END OF 1976.

38. HABIB SAID THAT THUS FAR, THE MASSIVE BLOOD BATH WHICH
THE UNITED STATES FEARED HAS NOT TAKEN PLACE. IT SHOULD BE
BORNE IN MIND THE UNITED STATES TOOK OUT 130,000 SOUTH
VIETNAMESE WHO MIGHT BE CONSIDERED AS PRIMARY TARGETS FOR
VIOLENT REPRISALS. OTHERWISE, HE SAID IT SEEMS A MASSIVE
RE-EDUCATION PROCESS IS UNDER WAY, WITH ORGANIZATION OF THE
URBAN POPULATION INTO CELLS AND BLOCK CELLS WITH THE EFFORT
GRADUALLY EXPANDING OUT INTO THE COUNTRYSIDE.

39. CATALANO (ITALY) JOINED IN EXPRESSING APPRECIATION FOR
HABIS'S PRESENCE AND HIS BRIEFING. HE SAID ALREADY THE
MORNING SESSION HAD, IN HIS VIEW, BEEN ONE OF THE BEST
ALLIANCE CONCULTATIONS HE COULD REMEMBER AND THAT MEETINGS
OF THIS SORT OUGHT TO BE AMONG THE BEST TRADITIONS OF NATO.
HE WISHED SIMPLY TO OBSERVE THAT HIS GOVERNMENT'S INFORMATION
CONFIRMED WHAT HABIB HAD SAID ABOUT THE SITUATION IN SAIGON; AND
HE ALSO WISHED TO ADD THAT JUST AS THE USSR MISSES NO CHANCE TO
CALL ATTENTION TO THE CHINESE DANGER, SIMILARLY, CHINA DOES THE
SAME ABOUT THE SOVIET DANGER.

40. DR. LAHN (FRG ASSISTANT STATE SECRETARY) NOTED THAT
FEDERAL CHANCELLOR SCHMIDT WAS ARRIVING IN PEKING ON THAT
VERY DAY. LAHN WISHED TO POINT OUT THAT AMONG PLACES SCHMIDT
WAS SCHEDULED TO VISIT ON HIS ORIGINAL PROGRAM WAS SHANGHAI.
HE SAID AT THE LAST MINUTE, PEKING HAD CANCELLED THE SHANGHAI
VISIT AND PROPOSED THAT SCHMIDT GO TO THE PROVINCE OF SINKIANG
AND ITS CAPITAL URUMCHI, WHICH IS A CENTER FOR CHINESE NUCLEAR
FACILITIES. LAHN SIMPLY WISHED TO POINT OUT THE CHANGE WAS
THE IDEA OF THE HOST AND AND NOT THE GUEST. HE ALSO INDICATED
THAT IF BY ANY WILD CHANCE THE CHINESE SHOULD SHOW SCHMIDT
CONFIDENTIAL

PAGE 02  NATO 05933  06 OF 06  311945Z

SOME NUCLEAR INSTALLATIONS, THE FRG WOULD, OF COURSE, REPORT
TO THE ALLIES.

41. LAHN THEN WISHED TO POSE A QUESTION CONCERNING THE RELATIONSHIP
BETWEEN SOUTH AND NORTH VIETNAM. HE WAS INTERESTED IN HABIB'S
SPECULATIONS THAT &quot;UNIFICATION&quot; MAY BE IMPOSED IN A VERY
SHORT TIME. NOTING THAT LE DUAN HAS RECENTLY BEEN TO
PEKING, MOSCOW AND A NUMBER OF EAST EUROPEAN CAPITALS,
AND NOTING THAT THE SOVIETS SEEM TO BE PREACHING THE THEME
OF UNIFICATION MORE STRONGLY THAN THE CHINESE, LAHN WONDERED
IF REUNIFICATION TOOK PLACE IN THE SHORT RUN, WOULD THIS
CAUSE A SUDDEN IMBALANCE IN THE EQUILIBRIUM OF WHICH HABIB
HAD SPOKEN? HABIB SAID THE US HAS HEARD RECURRING REPORTS
THAT PEKING PREFERS TO KEEP THE TWO VIETNAMS SEPARATE. THIS
SEEMS LIKE A LOGICAL POSITION FOR PEKING TO TAKE, AND IT MAY
BE THIS LOGIC RATHER THAN ANY BAIS IN FACT WHICH IS THE
SOURCE OF THE SERIES OF REPORTS. HABIB SAID THAT IT MAY BE
THAT A REUNIFIED VIETNAM WHICH HAS THE ABILITY TO LOOK
OUTWARD WILL BE A DISTURBING INFLUENCE IN EAST ASIA. HE
BELIEVES THIS PERSONALLY AND HE NOTED THAT VIETNAM'S NEIGHBORS
ALSO BELIEVE THIS. BUT HE CAUTIONED THAT THIS EVENTUALITY
WILL NOT COME ABOUT VERY QUICKLY. FURTHERMORE, PEKING MAY
REALIZE THAT IT CANNOT PREVENT REUNIFICATION EVEN IF IT
WISHED TO AND FOR THAT REASON MAY DECIDE NOT TO MAKE ANY
EFFORT TO PREVENT IT.

42. A/SYG PANSA CONCLUDED THE DISUCSSION, CALLING IT &quot;EXTREMELY
GOOD&quot;, ESPECIALLY IN THAT IT INVOLVED THE ALLIES IN THESE FAR
EAST QUESTIONS WHICH ARE NOT USUALLY WITHIN &quot;OUR SPHERE&quot;,
BUT WHICH ARE MATTERS RELATING TO THE COMMON INTERESTS OF THE ALLIES.
HE SAID THE MORNING CONSULTATION WAS IN HIW VIEW &quot;A GOOD OMEN&quot;
FOR FUTURE REINFORCED NAC CONSULTATIONS ON REGIONAL QUESTIONS.
HE COULD ONLY HOPE THAT SUCH FUTURE CONSULTATIONS WOULD BE AS
PROFITABLE AS THE ONE WHICH TOOK PLACE TODAY, AND WHICH WAS
VIVID EVIDENCE OF THE ALLIES PUTTING INTO PRACTICE THEIR RESOLVE
WITH REGARD TO CONSULTATIONS AS EXPRESSED IN PARA 11 OF THE OTTAWA
DECLARATION. PANSA THANKED ALL THE HIGH-LEVEL OFFICIALS WHO
HAD COME FROM CAPITALS AND ESPECIALLY AMBASSADOR HABIB, &quot;WHO
HAD COME THE LONGEST WAY&quot;.

43. PANSA THEN SAID IN ACCORD WITH COMMON PRACTICE, HE WOULD
CONFIDENTIAL

PAGE 03  NATO 05933  06 OF 06  311945Z

RPOPOSE THE NATO SPOKESMAN, ON AN IF-ASKED BASIS, TO DRAW ON THE
FOLLOWING GUIDANCE: &quot;AT TODAY'S REGULAR WEEKLY MEETING OF THE
NORTH ATLANTIC COUNCIL, ALLIED REPRESENTATIVES DISCUSSED THE
GENERAL SUBJECT OF EAST ASIA. THE PERMANENT REPRESENTATIVES
WERE JOINED BY SENIOR OFFICIALS FROM CAPITALS AS FOLLOWS:

BELGIUM - AMBASSAODR ANDRE WENDELEN
GERMANY - DR. LOTHAR LAHN, ASSISTANT STATE SECRETARY
ITALY - MINISTER MARCELLO SALIMEI
NETHERLANDS - MR. J. ROOKMAKER, DIRECTOR OF EASTERN AFFAIRS DEPARTMEN
T
UNITED KINGDOM - MR. P.J.E. MALE, ASSISTANT UNDER SECRETARY
OF STATE
UNITED STATES - MR. PHILIP C. HABIB, ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF
STATE FOR EAST ASIAN AND PACIFIC AFFAIRS

&quot;THIS EXCHANGE OF VIEWS ON EAST ASIA IS PART OF THE CONTINUOUS
PROCESS OF ALLIED POLITICAL CONSULTATION WHICH HAS ALWAYS
BEEN PART OF NATO ACITVITIES. THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS PROCESS
WAS CONFIRMED IN ARTICLE II OF THE OTTAWA DECLARATION IN
JUNE 1974, AND AFFIRMED ONCE MORE BY THE NATO HEADS OF
GOVERNMENT WHEN THEY MET IN BRUSSELS IN MAY 1975.&quot; THERE
WAS NO OBJECTION.
