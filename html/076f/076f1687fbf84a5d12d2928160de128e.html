		<h3>Tor</h3>
		<p><a href="https://www.torproject.org">Tor</a> is an encrypted anonymising network that makes it harder to intercept internet communications, or see where communications are coming from or going to.</p>
		<p>In order to use the WikiLeaks public submission system as detailed above you can download the Tor Browser Bundle, which is a Firefox-like browser available for Windows, Mac OS X and GNU/Linux and pre-configured to connect using the anonymising system Tor.</p>
		<h4>Tails</h4>
		<p>If you are at high risk and you have the capacity to do so, you can also access the submission system through a secure operating system called <a href="https://tails.boum.org">Tails</a>. Tails is an operating system launched from a USB stick or a DVD that aim to leaves no traces when the computer is shut down after use and automatically routes your internet traffic through Tor. Tails will require you to have either a USB stick or a DVD at least 4GB big and a laptop or desktop computer.</p>

		<h3>Tips</h3>
		<p>Our submission system works hard to preserve your anonymity, but we recommend you also take some of your own precautions. Please review these basic guidelines. </p>
		<div>
			<h4>1. Contact us if you have specific problems</h4>
			<p>If you have a very large submission, or a submission with a complex format, or are a high-risk source, please <a href="#submit_help_contact">contact us</a>. In our experience it is always possible to find a custom solution for even the most seemingly difficult situations.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h4>2. What computer to use</h4>
			<p>If the computer you are uploading from could subsequently be audited in an investigation, consider using a computer that is not easily tied to you. Technical users can also use <a href="https://tails.boum.org">Tails</a> to help ensure you do not leave any records of your submission on the computer.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h4>3. Do not talk about your submission to others</h4>
			<p>If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in source protection – it is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This includes other media organisations.</p>
		</div>

	</div>

		<h3>After</h3>

		<div>
			<h4>1. Do not talk about your submission to others</h4>
			<p>If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in source protection – it is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This includes other media organisations.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h4>2. Act normal</h4>
			<p>If you are a high-risk source, avoid saying anything or doing anything after submitting which might promote suspicion. In particular, you should try to stick to your normal routine and behaviour.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h4>3. Remove traces of your submission</h4>
			<p>If you are a high-risk source and the computer you prepared your submission on, or uploaded it from, could subsequently be audited in an investigation, we recommend that you format and dispose of the computer hard drive and any other storage media you used.</p>
			<p>In particular, hard drives retain data after formatting which may be visible to a digital forensics team and flash media (USB sticks, memory cards and SSD drives) retain data even after a secure erasure. If you used flash media to store sensitive data, it is important to destroy the media.</p>
			<p>If you do this and are a high-risk source you should make sure there are no traces of the clean-up, since such traces themselves may draw suspicion.</p>
			<div>
				<h4>4. If you face legal action</h4>
				<p>If a legal action is brought against you as a result of your submission, there are organisations that may help you. The Courage Foundation is an international organisation dedicated to the protection of journalistic sources. You can find more details at <a href="https://www.couragefound.org">https://www.couragefound.org</a>.</p>

		<p>WikiLeaks publishes documents of political or historical importance that are censored or otherwise suppressed. We specialise in strategic global publishing and large archives.</p>
		<p>The following is the address of our secure site where you can anonymously upload your documents to WikiLeaks editors. You can only access this submissions system through Tor. (See our <a href="#submit_help_tor">Tor tab</a> for more information.) We also advise you to read our <a href="#submit_help_tips">tips for sources</a> before submitting.</p>

			<!--<div>
				Copy this address into your Tor browser. Advanced users, if they wish, can also add a further layer of encryption to their submission using <a href="#submit_wlkey">our public PGP key</a>.
			</div>-->
		</div>

		<p>If you cannot use Tor, or your submission is very large, or you have specific requirements, WikiLeaks provides several alternative methods. <a href="#submit_help_contact">Contact us</a> to discuss how to proceed.</p>

1.  LA TIMES (JOHNSTON), PRETORIA:  &quot;KISSINGER, SMITH TALK
FOR 8 HOURS; RESULT UNCERTAIN&quot; - RHODESIAN PM SMITH MET
FOR NEARLY 8 HOURS SUNDAY WITH KISSINGER, THEN RETURNED
HOME WITHOUT COMMENTING ON ANGLO-AMERICAN PROPOSALS FOR
TRANSFERRING POWER TO HIS COUNTRY'S BLACK MAJORITY.

...U.S. OFFICIALS WERE UNUSUALLY RETICENT SUNDAY NIGHT AND
REFUSED TO PROVIDE DETAILS OF THE TALKS.

ON THE RECORD, KISSINGER WAS CLAIMING NO NEGOTIATING BREAK-
THROUGH--EVEN THOUGH KAUNDA AND NYERERE, IN PUBLIC STATE-
MENTS LAST WEEK, LEFT UNMISTAKABLE IMPRESSION THAT A
NEGOTIATING BREAKTHROUGH ON RHODESIA ISSUE WAS LEAST THAT
WOULD SATISFY THEM.
UNCLASSIFIED

UNCLASSIFIED

PAGE 02        STATE  233038 TOSEC 270408


THE BEST KISSINGER COULD OFFER SUNDAY WAS PROPOSITION,
DUBIOUS EVEN TO WHITE SOUTH AFRICAN LISTENERS, THAT &quot;IF
PROGRESS HAD NOT BEEN MADE, THERE WOULD BE NOTHING TO
REPORT TO THE RHODESIAN CABINET.&quot;

LATESUNDAY NIGHT A SPOKESMAN REPORTED THAT AFTER SMITH'S
DEPARTURE, VORSTER AND KISSINGER SPOKE FOR TWO AND A HALF
HOURS MORE ON OTHER MAIN SUBJECT ON THEIR AGENDA, NAMIBIA
(SOUTH-WEST AFRICA). WITHOUT GIVING ANY DETAILS, SPOKES-
MAN EAGLEBURGER SAID &quot;CONSIDERABLE PROGRESS WAS MADE&quot; ON
THIS ISSUE, WHICH INVOLVES DEVISING A MECHANISM ACCEPTABLE
TO BLACK AFRICANS FOR A TRANSFER OF AUTHORITY FROM SOUTH
AFRICA TO BLACK MAJORITY RULE THERE.

THERE WAS NO INFORMATION THAT WOULD BEAR OUT KISSINGER'S
EARLIER OPTIMISM CONVEYED TO REPORTERS ON THE WAY HERE
FROM ZAMBIA LAST FRIDAY.

... BY THE VERY ACT OF AGREEING TO SEE SMITH AT THIS STAGE
IN THE NEGOTIATIONS, KISSINGER HAS SIGNIFICANTLY RELAXED
THE BARGAINING PRECONDITIONS HE HAD EARLIER IMPOSED.

...BY LATE SATURDAY NIGHT, WHEN DECISION TO SEE SMITH WAS
TAKEN, REPORTERS WERE TOLD KISSINGER WISHED TO ESCAPE CON-
FINES OF THAT FORMULATION AND SEE SMITH ON THE MORE AMBI-
GUOUS GROUND THAT &quot;SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS&quot; IMMINENT.

THIS GAVE RISE TO REPORTS FROM BRITISH SOURCES THAT TWO-
YEAR TIMETABLE HAD BEEN SCRAPPED BY KISSINGER.  RHODESIAN
SOURCES SUNDAY CONFIRMED THAT SMITH WOULD ON NO ACCOUNT
ACCEPT A TWO-YEAR DEADLINE FOR BLACK AMJORITY RULE IN
HIS COUNTRY.... (SEPTEMBER 20)

2.  LA TIMES (JOHNSTON) PRETORIA (SEPTEMBER 18): &quot;KISSINGER
HINTS AT BREAKTHROUGH ON NAMIBIA FUTURE&quot; - KISSINGER
ARRIVED HERE FRIDAY TO BEGIN CRUCIAL STAGE OF HIS AFRICAN
MISSION, EXPRESSING UNUSUAL BUT PRECISELY QUALIFIED CON-
FIDENCE THAT AN IMPORTANT BREAKTHROUGH ON FUTURE OF NAMIBIA
(SOUTH-WEST AFRICA) MAY BE AT HAND.

UNCLASSIFIED

UNCLASSIFIED

PAGE 03        STATE  233038 TOSEC 270408

THROUGH A COMBINATION OF PUBLIC AND SEMIPRIVATE STATEMENTS
TO REPORTERS TRAVELING WITH OFFICIAL PARTY, KISSINGER AND
HIS AIDES CLEARLY INDICATED THEY EXPECT SOUTH AFRICAN
PM VORSTER TO MAKE AN IMPORTANT CONCESSION TO BLACK DEMANDS
ON ISSUE OF NAMIBIA, UN TRUST TERRITORY THAT SOUTH AFRICA
HOLDS UNDER DISPUTED CONTROL.

...IN PAST NEGOTIATIONS KISSINGER, AN ACCOMPLISHED STAGE
MANAGER, HAS ALWAYS SOUGHT TO CULTIVATE A PUBLIC APPEAR-
ANCE OF PROGRESS AND SUCCESS WHEN HE APPROACHES A TURN-
ING POINT IN HIS EFFORT.

ACCORDINGLY, CAREFULLY NURTURED HINTS OF PROBABLE SUCCESS
ON NAMIBIA AND POSSIBLE PROGRESS ON RHODESIA FIT IN WELL
WITH HIS METHODS.
BUT IT IS ALSO TRUE THAT KISSINGER RECEIVED A GENUINE
LIFT THURSDAY FROM ZAMBIAN PRESIDENT KAUNDA, WHOSE EMO-
TIONAL DECLARATION OF HOPE FOR KISSINGER'S MISSION AND OF
CONFIDENCE IN HIS MOTIVES CLEARLY BOOSTED THE MORALE OF
THE AMERICAN PARTY.

...AT KAUNDA'S REQUEST, HE MET FOR FIFTEEN MINUTES FRIDAY
MORNING IN LUSAKA WITH KNOMO, LEADER OF OLDEST, MOST
ESTABLISHED AND LEAST MILITANT OF BLACK RHODESIAN FACTIONS,
WHICH ARE PLANNING AN EXPANDED GUERRILLA CAMPAIGN THIS
FALL IF THE CURRENT DIPLOMATIC EFFORT PRODUCES NO IMMEDIATE
RESULT.

3.  LA TIMES (JOHNSTON), PRETORIA:  &quot;KISSINGER AND SMITH
TO MEET ON RHODESIA - 'SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS' CITED AS
REASON FOR BRINGING PM INTO TALKS&quot; - KISSINGER HAS DECIDED
TO MEET WITH RHODESIAN PM SMITH TO BRING SMITH DIRECTLY
INTO HIS DIPLOMATIC EFFORT TO AVOID RACE WAR IN SOUTHERN
AFRICA, U.S. OFFICIALS ANNOUNCED HERE EARLY TODAY.

...UNTIL RECENTLY, SUCH A MTG BETWEEN KISSINGER AND SMITH
HAD BEEN RULED OUT BECAUSE KISSINGER HAD REQUIRED AT LEAST
SMITH'S TACIT ACCEPTANCE OF BLACK MAJORITY RULE IN HIS
COUNTRY WITHIN TWO YEARS AS A PRECONDITION.  NOW STANDARDS
APPARENTLY HAVE BEEN RELAXED TO POINT THAT KISSINGER
AGREED TO SEE SMITH BECAUSE, IN HIS OWN JUDGMENT, &quot;SIGNI-
UNCLASSIFIED

UNCLASSIFIED

PAGE 04        STATE  233038 TOSEC 270408

FICANT PROGRESS&quot; HAS BEEN MADE TOWARD AN AGREEMENT ON
BLACK MAJORITY RULE.

BY LATE SATURDAY, REPORTERS WERE TOLD, KISSINGER BELIEVED
SOME PROGRESS HAD BEEN MADE ON RHODESIA, BUT THAT LATE
AFTERNOON SESSION BETWEEN VORSTER AND SMITH WOULD BE
NECESSARY BEFORE KISSINGER COULD RISK MEETING SMITH.

...KISSINGER, FRIDAY HINTED THAT SOUTH AFRICAN ACQUIESCENCE
IN BLACK NATIONALIST PARTICIPATION AT AN INTERNATIONAL
CONFERENCE ON FUTURE OF SOUTH-WEST AFRICAN TRUST TERRITORY
MIGHT BE WITHIN SIGHT.

BY SATURDAY, HOWEVER, IT WAS EVIDENT NO SUCH SUCCESS WAS
LIKELY TO EMERGE FROM CURRENT TALKS.

INSTEAD OF PRESSING FOR OUTRIGHT SOUTH AFRICAN ACCEPTANCE
OF SOUTH-WEST AFRICAN PEOPLES' ORGANIZATION AS A NEGOTIA-
TING PARTNER, IT WAS UNDERSTOOD FROM SOURCES CLOSE TO
TALKS THAT KISSINGER WAS TRYING TO DEVELOP ONE OF TORTUOUS
COMPROMISES FOR WHICH HE IS NOTED.  IT WOULD INVOLVE A
MULTI-STAGE CONFERENCE WITH DIFFERING LEVELS OF PARTICIPA-
TION BY VARIOUS NAMIBIAN GROUPS, AT DIFFERING TIMES.

AS IS CUSTOMARY WITH A KISSINGER-RUN NEGOTIATION AT MID-
POINT, PUBLIC KNOWLEDGE OF PROGRESS OF TALKS HAS BEEN
FRAGMENTARY, AMBIGUOUS AND EASILY SUSCEPTIBLE TO MANIPU-
LATION BY PARTICIPANTS.

BUT SEQUENCE OF EVENTS SINCE LAST WEDNESDAY, WHEN KISSINGER
MET WITH PRESIDENT NYERERE, APPEARED BEGINNING TO FALL
INTO A PATTERN -- ONE IN WHICH KISSINGER, THE GO-BETWEEN,
FIRST FOUND HIMSELF PRESSED FOR RESULTS BY NYERERE AND
OTHER BLACK AFRICAN LEADERS MORE HARSHLY THAN EXPECTED,
THEN LATER FOUND VORSTER UNWILLING TO BE AS COOPERATIVE
AS KISSINGERHAD EXPECTED.

RESULT, IT SEEMED SATURDAY, WAS THAT KISSINGER FOUND HIM-
SELF IN DANGER OF FACING A DEADLOCKED NEGOTIATION -- AND
THEREFORE A FAILED NEGOTIATION -- AT A POINT WHERE, ONLY
A WEEK AGO, HE MIGHT HAVE EXPECTED MORE PROGRESS POSSIBLE.

PAGE 05        STATE  233038 TOSEC 270408


AS REPORTERS WERE TOLD SATURDAY, IT IS POSSIBLE TO CLAIM
CONSIDERABLE PROGRESS IN A NEGOTIATION, AND IN FACT TO
HAVE ACHIEVED PROGRESS, AND STILL HAVE IT BEEN DEEMED A
FAILURE.

HENCE, APPARENTLY, RESORT TO MTG WITH SMITH.  WHILE RELAX-
ING HIS STAND THAT IN RETURN FOR MTG SMITH MUST ACCEPT
PUBLICLY PRINCIPLE OF MAJORITY RULE, KISSINGER STILL IN-
SISTED UPON &quot;SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS.&quot;

...UNOFFICIAL REPORTS REACHING HERE SATURDAY FROM DAR ES
SALAAM SUGGESTED, MOROEVER, THAT NEGOTIATING HONEYMOON
BETWEEN KISSINGER AND NYERERE MAY BE OVER.  TANZANIAN
PRESIDENT WAS REPORTED TO BE INCENSED BY NEWS REPORTS
THAT A &quot;SENIOR OFFICIAL&quot; TRAVELING WITH KISSINGER, A UNI-
VERSALLY ACCEPTED DESIGNATION FOR THE SECRETARY HIMSELF,
HAD DISMISSED NYERERE'S PUBLIC PESSIMISM AT A NEWS CON-
FERENCE WEDNESDAY IN FAVOR OF WHAT WERE DESCRIBED TO BE
MORE MODERATE EXPRESSIONS IN PRIVATE CONVERSATION.

AT SAME TIME, CONCLUSION APPEARED UNAVOIDABLE THAT SMITH
HAD PLAYED A VERY ADROIT GAME TO MAKE QUESTION OF WHETHER
HE MET KISSINGER IN PRETORIA THIS WEEKEND SEEM CRUCIAL
ISSUES FACING KISSINGER-VORSTER TALKS.

...DURING MORNING, A GROUP OF RHODESIAN CITIZENS PRESENTED
THEMSELVES AT U.S. EMBASSY CHANCERY HERE, REQUESTING PER-
MISSION TO PRESENT A GIFT, AN OIL PORTRAIT OF KISSINGER
EXECUTED BY A RHODESIAN ARTIST.

FOLLOWING PROTOCOL FOR DEALING WITH NATIONALS OF A COUNTRY
WHICH U.S. DOES NOT RECOGNIZE, SECURITY GUARDS AT EMBASSY
POLITELY TURNED RHODESIANS AWAY WHILE ACCEPTING PORTRAIT.

SOON AFTERWARDS, MEMBERS OF SECRET SERVICE DETAIL GUARDING
KISSINGER WERE SEEN CARRYING PORTRAIT UPSTAIRS IN ELEVATOR
OF HOTEL IN WHICH KISSINGER PARTY IS STAYING.  IT APPEARED
THAT SMITH, HOWEVER VICARIOUSLY, HAD ONCE AGAIN SUCCEEDED
IN GETTING IN BACK WAY.  (SEPTEMBER 19)

HEADING:  &quot;PROGRESS IN PRETORIA&quot;

THE FIRST LEG OF HENRY KISSINGER'S AFRICAN SHUTTLE WAS
BEHIND HIM, AND IT HAD BEEN A ROUGH ONE.  NOW HE WAS FLYING
INTO A STATE BESIEGED.  WHEN KISSINGER ARRIVED IN SOUTH
AFRICA LAST WEEK, NEW BLACK RIOTS WERE ERUPTING IN
URBAN GHETTOS, AND AS HE DROVE INTO PRETORIA, THE
LOCAL NEWSPAPER CARRIED A GIANT PHOTOGRAPH OF HIM ALONG
WITH THE HEADLINE &quot;MAKE OR BREAK&quot;.  KISSINGER QUICKLY
BEGAN A ROUND OF TALKS WITH SOUTH AFRICAN PM JOHN VORSTER.
THEN, ONLY A DAY LATER, CAME THE SURPRISE ANNOUNCEMENT:
SECSTATE WOULD ALSO MEET WITH IAN SMITH, THE PM OF WHITE-
SUPREMACIST RHODESIA.                                  -

KISSINGER'S APPOINTMENT WITH THE STUBBORN LEADER OF
THE BREAKAWAY BRITISH COLONY SET OFF SPECULATION
THAT A BREAKTHROUGH WAS IMMINENT IN THE SEC'S EFFORT TO
HEAD OFF A RACE WAR IN SOUTHERN AFRICA.  HAK, IT SEEMED,
HAD ALREADY PERSUADED VORSTER TO SOFTEN HIS STAND ON
INDEPENDENCE FOR NAMIBIA, THE SOUTH AFRICAN-RULED TRUST
TERRITORY ALSO KNOWN AS SOUTHWEST AFRICA.  NOW, IT
APPEARED TO MANY PEOPLE THAT SMITH WAS RESPONDING TO
PRESSURE FROM KISSINGER -- AND PERHAPS FROM VORSTER, TOO.

WEEKS OF HELL:  SO FAR, NO ONE KNEW WHAT SECRET DIPLOMACY
LAY BEHIND THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE SUMMIT WITH SMITH.
BUT IT WAS WIDELY ASSUMED THAT THE RHODESIAN LEADER WAS
PREPARED TO MAKE AT LEAST PARTIAL CONCESSIONS.  THROUGH-
OUT THE SHUTTLE, THE AMERICANS HAD ACKNOWLEDGED THAT
KISSINGER COULD NOT RISK OFFENDING THE BLACK AFRICAN NATIONS
ON HIS ITINERARY BY MEETING WITH SMITH UNLESS SOMETHING
IMPORTANT WAS TO BE GAINED.  ONE SENIOR OFFICIAL IN THE
AMERICAN PARTY SAID THE SEC WOULD SIT DOWN WITH SMITH
ONLY IF HAK WAS &quot;ABLE TO REPORT TO THE BLACK PRESIDENTS
THAT SOME SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS WAS BEING MADE THAT THEY
WOULD RECOGNIZE AS SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS.&quot;  EVEN SO, THE
OFFICIAL ADDED, HAK &quot;MIGHT HAVE TO TAKE HELL FOR A FEW

WEEKS&quot; IN BLACK AFRICA.  &quot;BUT IF AT THE END OF A FEW
WEEKS OR A MONTH THINGS ARE CONCLUDED, IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN
WORTH IT.&quot;

THE AMERICAN SECSTATE HAD JUST COME FROM TALKS WITH
TWO BLACK AFRICAN LEADERS, PRES JULIUS NYERERE OF TANZ-
ANIA AND PRES KENNETH KAUNDA OF ZAMBIA.  THERE HAK RAN
INTO SOMETHING FOR WHICH ALL HIS YEARS OF MIRACLE-WORKING
HAD NOT PREPARED HIM:  A STYLE OF DIPLOMACY IN WHICH HIS
HOSTS PRIVATELY GAVE HIM CAUTIOUS ENCOURAGEMENT -- AND
THEN PUBLICLY CAST DOUBT ON HIS MISSION.  ALTHOUGH
ANGERED BY THOSE TACTICS, HAK FELT THERE WAS REASON
ENOUGH TO CARRY ONE.

THE FIRST PART OF HAK'S AFRICAN JOURNEY, A TWO-DAY STOP
IN THE TANZANIAN CAPITAL OF DAR ES SALAAM, BEGAN BADLY.
HE WAS VISIBLY TAKEN ABACK WHEN A CROWD OF 200
DEMONSTRATORS MET HIM AT THE AIRPORT CHANTING &quot;GO HOME,
GO HOME&quot; AND WAVING SIGNS DENOUNCING HIM AS, AMONG OTHER
THINGS, THE &quot;TRAVELING CASHIER OF IMPERIALISM.&quot;  WHEN
THE DEMONSTRATORS CLIMBED INTO BUSES TO FOLLOW HIM
INTO TOWN, IT BECAME CLEAR THAT THE NOISY PROTEST
HAD BEEN GOVT SANCTIONED.  AT HIS HOTEL, HAK RESPONDED
WITH A BRUSQUE STATEMENT THAT THE TRIP TO AFRICA WAS
NOT HIS IDEA.  &quot;THIS INITIATIVE STARTED AT THE REQUEST
OF THE AFRICAN LEADERS DURING MY VISIT IN APRIL,&quot; HE
DECLARED.  &quot;EVERY STEP THAT HAS BROUGHT US HERE HAS BEEN
CAREFULLY DISCUSSED WITH LEADERS IN AFRICA AND ESPECIALLY
THE (BLACK)PRESIDENTS.&quot;

UPBEAT:  THE NEXT MORNING, HAK CHIDED PRES NYERERE ABOUT
THE DEMONSTRATIONS, AND THE 54-YEAR-OLD TANZANIAN LEADER
REPLIED THAT HE COULD NOT CONTROL SUCH OUTPOURINGS IN
A DEMOCRACY.  NONETHELESS, SOURCES SAID THE MOOD OF THE
FOUR-HOUR MEETING WAS GENERALLY FRIENDLY AND UPBEAT.
AT A PRESS CONFERENCE LATER, NYERERE PRAISED HAK'S JOURNEY
AS A &quot;SHUTTLE OF CLARITY&quot; AND REJECTED THE IDEA THAT IT
WAS DOOMED TO FAILURE.  BUT THEN NYERERE GAVE HAK THE BACK
OF HIS HAND.  &quot;REALLY, ON THE BASIS OF WHAT I KNOW UP TO
NOW,&quot; HE OBSERVED, &quot;I COULD EVEN SAY I AM LESS HOPEFUL THAN
I WAS.&quot;
UNCLASSIFIED

PAGE 08        STATE  233038 TOSEC 270408


ONE DIPLOMAT IN DAR ES SALAAM INTERPRETED NYERERE'S CURT
STATEMENT AS AN ATTEMPT TO &quot;COVER HIS REAR IN CASE THE
HAK MISSION FAILS AND ALSO APPEASE HARD-LINE ELEMENTS WHO
DISTRUST HAK'S MOTIVES.&quot;  HAK HIMSELF, THOUGH SURPRISED,
BRUSHED ASIDE NYERERE'S REMARKS AS A MATTER OF NEGOTIATING
TACTICS.  HAK'S PUBLIC RECEPTION WAS WARMER IN THE ZAM-
BIAN CAPITAL OF LUSAKA.  FORNMIN SITEKE MWALE GREETED
HIM AT THE AIRPORT WITH AN EMBRACE AND PRES KAUNDA LATER
ASSURED THE AMERICAN THAT HE WAS PRAYING HARD FOR HIS
SUCCESS.  BUT AS THE TWO MEN SAT ACROSS FROM EACH OTHER AT
A CONFERENCE TABLE IN THE RED BRICK STATE HOUSE, KAUNDA
ISSUED A BLUNT WARNING.  &quot;YOU HAVE ONLY A FEW DAYS -- NOT
WEEKS -- TO SUCCEED,&quot; HE SAID.  &quot;IF YOU FAIL, WE SHALL
HAVE REACHED THE POINT OF NO RETURN.&quot;

EMOTION:  THE 52-YEAR-OLD KAUNDA, A MODERATE WHO IS OFTEN
CALLED THE &quot;CONSCIENCE OF AFRICA,&quot; WAS SOON OVERCOME BY
EMOTION, DABBING AT HIS EYES WITH A WHITE HANDKERCHIEF.
VISIBLY TOUCHED, HAK RESPONDED:  &quot;I PRAY FOR ALL OF US --
FOR YOUR PEOPLE AND OUR PEOPLE -- THAT I CAN BRING YOU
ENCOURAGING NEWS.&quot;  AFTER HIS TALKS WITH KAUNDA, HAK
MET BRIEFLY WITH JOSHUA NKOMO, LEADER OF ONE OF THE
BLACK FACTIONS FIGHTING IN RHODESIA.  PERHAPS TO DIVERT
NEWSMEN, KAUNDA HELD AN IMPROMPTU PRESS CONFERENCE, IN
WHICH HIS VIEWS ON THE HAK SHUTTLE WERE LESS FERVID.  HE
CALLED HIS TALKS WITH THE SEC &quot;USEFUL DISCUSSIONS,&quot;
BUT ADDED:  &quot;I DIDN'T EXPECT HIM TO BRING ANYTHING NEW.&quot;

AS HAK LEFT LUSAKA FOR HIS MEETING WITH VORSTER, SOUTH
AFRICA ITSELF WAS IN TURMOIL.  IN CAPE TOWN, POLICE HAD
OPENED FIRE ON COLORED DEMONSTRATORS.  IN JOHANNESBURG,
FIRE BOMBS EXPLODED IN TWO DEPT STORES, AND BLACKS STONED
BUSES CARRYING WHITE COMMUTERS -- THE FIRST OMINOUS
SIGNS OF TERRORISM DELIBERATELY AIMED AT WHITES.  AT
ALMOST THE SAME TIME THAT HAK'S PLANE TOUCHED DOWN AT
WATERKLOOF MILITARY AIRPORT, BLACK STUDENTS IN SOWETO
STAGED A MASS MARCH, CARRYING BANNERS READING &quot;KISSINGER
IS A KILLER&quot; AND SINGING PROTEST SONGS.  WHEN THE
CROWD TRIED TO MARCH ON NEARBY JOHANNESBURG AND IGNORED
A WARNING TO TURN BACK, POLICE SHOT THREE OF THEM DEAD.

THEOLOGY:  EVEN SO, HAK APPEARED OPTIMISTIC FOR PROGRESS
IN HIS TALKS WITH VORSTER ON THE ISSUE OF NAMIBIA.  VORSTER,
HE THOUGHT, MIGHT AGREE TO INDEPENDENCE FOR THE DISPUTED
TERRITORY BY THE END OF NEXT YEAR, A YEAR AHEAD OF THE
CURRENT SCHEDULE.  HAK ALSO WAS PRESSING VORSTER TO
INCLUDE IN FUTURE TALKS ON NAMIBIA THE PRINCIPAL BLACK
GUERRILLA GROUP THERE, THE SWAPO.  BUT THERE WERE STILL
MANY QUESTIONS TO BE RESOLVED THAT COULD BLOCK PROGRESS
TOWARD A SETTLEMENT.  &quot;THE NAMIBIAN THING IS DOWN NOW TO
THEOLOGICAL POINTS THAT MEAN A HELL OF A LOT TO THE
PARTICIPANTS,&quot; SAID A SENIOR OFFICIAL IN KISSINGER'S PARTY.
&quot;AND THAT MAY BLOW IT SKY HIGH.&quot;

AS THE DISCUSSIONS CONTINUED, SMITH FLEW TO SOUTH AFRICA.
AT THE OUTSET OF THE HAK SHUTTLE, PROGRESS ON RHODESIA
WAS THOUGHT TO BE A LOT LESS LIKELY THAN AGREEMENT ON
NAMIBIA.  BUT THEN VORSTER WENT TO WORK ON HIS
GUEST.  THEY MET FIRST AT VORSTER'S HILLTOP RESIDENCE
(SMITH ARRIVED ONLY MINUTES AFTER KISSINGER HAD LEFT
FOR A MEETING WITH SOUTH AFRICAN OPPOSITION LEADERS).
THEN THE TWO MEN ATTENDED A RUGBY FOOTBALL MATCH.  THAT
EVENING, HAK JOINED VORSTER FOR DINNER, AND AFTERWARD
US SPOKESMAN LAWRENCE EAGLEBURGER MADE THE ANNOUNCEMENT:
&quot;THE SECRETARY WILL MEET WITH PRIME MINISTER SMITH AT
9:30 (THE NEXT MORNING) AT THE AMERICAN AMBASSADOR'S
RESIDENCE.&quot;

EAGLEBURGER BRUSHED ASIDE ALL QUESTIONS, AND THERE WAS NO
INDICATION OF WHAT PRICE -- IF ANY -- KISSINGER HAD EX-
TRACTED FROM SMITH IN RETURN FOR THE MEETING.  SO FAR,
THE RHODESIAN LEADER HAD ADAMANTLY REJECTED DEMANDS FOR
BLACK MAJORITY RULE IN HIS COUNTRY.   THERE WAS NO EV-
IDENCE THAT HE WOULD CAVE IN BEFORE KISSINGER.  BUT IT
WAS EQUALLY UNLIKELY THAT HAK WOULD HAVE AGREED TO THE
MEETING WITHOUT SOME REASON TO HOPE FOR AT LEAST PRIVATE
ASSURANCES OF PROGRESS TOWARD A SETTLEMENT.  WHATEVER
TRANSPIRED WITH SMITH, THE FIRST WEEK OF KISSINGER'S
AFRICAN SHUTTLE HAD ALREADY PRODUCED MORE RESULTS THAN
MANY PEOPLE HAD EXPECTED.

PARTY AND PETER YOUNGHUSBAND IN CAPE TOWN

2.  TIME MAGAZINE, SEPTEMBER 27 ISSUE:

&quot;SOUTHERN AFRICA: SHUTTLING BETWEEN BLACK AND WHITE&quot;

&quot;SCORES OF SOLDIERS AND POLICE, AS WELL AS AN ALL-BLACK
HONOR GUARD, WERE ON HAND TO GREET HENRY KISSINGER AS HE A
ARRIVED IN THE SOUTH AFRICAN CAPITAL OF PRETORIA LATE LAST
WEEK ON THE THIRD STOP OF HIS LATEST EFFORT AT SHUTTLE
DIPLOMACY.  ALL WEEK LONG SPORADIC RIOTING HAD CONTINUED
IN THE NONWHITE TOWNSHIPS AROUND JOHANNESBURG AND CAPE
TOWN, AND A DEPARTMENT STORE IN DOWNTOWN JOHANNESBURG
WAS FIRE-BOMBED -- THE FIRST SUCH ACT OF URBAN TERRORISM
IN THE COUNTRY'S HISTORY.  SHORTLY BEFORE KISSINGER'S
BLUE AND WHITE 707 TOUCHED DOWN, POLICE FIRED AT
DEMONSTRATORS IN JOHANNESBURG'S SOWETO TOWNSHIP, KILLING
SIX STUDENTS AND WOUNDING 35.  IN NO TIME, RUMORS WERE
CIRCULTATING IN LONDON, NEW YORK AND ELSEWHERE THAT THE
SECRETARY HAD BEEN ASSASSINATED.  PARAPHRASING MARK
TWAIN, KISSINGER QUICKLY RETORTED THAT THE REPORTS OF HIS
'HAVING BEEN SHOT WERE GROSSLY EXAGGERATED.'

&quot;BRUTAL TALK:  THE SECRETARY DID NOT FIND MANY OPPORTUNITIES
FOR JOCULARITY IN HIS ATTEMPT TO HEAD OFF BY NEGOTIATION
THE RACIAL ARMAGEDDON THAT SEEMS TO BE LOOMING IN SOUTHERN
AFRICA. TANZANIA'S PRESIDENT J. NYERERE HAD ANNOUNCED
THAT HE WAS NOT 'PARTICULARLY ENCOURAGED' BY KISSINGER'S
MISSION. ZAMBIA'S PRESIDENT K. KAUNDA HAD DECLARED THAT
KISSINGER MIGHT HAVE 'ONLY A FEW DAYS, NOT WEEKS' TO
SUCCEED IN AVERTING A BLACK-WHITE WAR.

&quot;WHEN KISSINGER ARRIVED IN PRETORIA, HE HAD NO EXPECTATION
OF BRINGING ABOUT ANY CHANGE IN SOUTH AFRICA'S CHERISHED
SYSTEM OF APARTHEID, OR 'SEPARATE DEVELOPMENT.'    BUT
HE WAS ANXIOUS TO SEE WHETHER A ROUND OF SUSTAINED
NEGOTIATIONS COULD END THE IMPASSE OVER RHODESIA, WHOSE
WHITE MINORITY GOVERNMENT BROKE AWAY FROM BRITISH RULE
ELEVEN YEARS AGO.  AND HE WAS PARTICULARLY HOPEFUL THAT IF
ALL :LSE FAILED, HE COULD ACHIEVE SOME MEASURED PROGRESS
UNCLASSIFIED

ON NAMIBIA,  OR S-W AFRICA, THE ONETIME LEAGUE OF NATIONS
TERRITORY THAT SOUTH AFRICA HAS RULED SINCE 1920.

&quot;SOUTH AFRICAN PRIME MINISTER J. VORSTER MADE IT CLEAR
FROM THE BEGINNING THAT HIS DISCUSSIONS WITH KISSINGER
WOULD NOT DEAL WITH SOUTH AFRICA ITSELF.  IF VORSTER
IS DETERMINED TO MAINTAIN WHITE RULE AT HOME, HE IS ALSO
CONVINCED, HOWEVER, THAT IT CAN NO LONGER BE UPHELD IN
EITHER RHODESIA OR NAMIBIA.  BY AGREEING TO A TRANSITION
TO MAJORITY RULE IN THOSE TERRITORIES, HE BELIEVES SOUTH
AFRICA CAN GAIN ENOUGH TIME FOR ITSELF TO BUILD LASTING
TIES WITH ITS BLACK NEIGHBORS.  AT ZURICH TWO WEEKS AGO,
VORSTER HINTED TO KISSINGER THAT HE WAS PREPARED TO STEP
UP THE PRESSURE ON RHODESIAN PRIME MINISTER IAN SMITH.
ACCORDINGLY, VORSTER LAST WEEK TREATED SMITH TO A DUTCH
UNCLE TALK THAT ONE DIPLOMAT DESCRIBED AS 'TOUGH TO THE
POINT OF BRUTALITY.'  EVIDENTLY, HE WARNED SMITH THAT
PRETORIA'S FUTURE CAPACITY FOR HELPING RHODESIA WILL BE
INCREASINGLY LIMITED.  AS SMITH WELL KNOWS, AN ESTIMATED
$100 MILLION WORTH OF RHODESIAN BULK EXPORTS OF CORN,
MINERALS AND TOBACCO ARE ALREADY HELD UP ON THE RHODESIAN
SIDE OF THE BORDER FOR LACK OF SPACE ON SOUTH AFRICA'S
CROWDED RAIL LINES TO CARRY THEM TO THE SEA.

&quot;BE HONEST:  SMITH LEFT THE MEETING LOOKING PALE AND
ANGRY.  HE TOOK OFF IMMEDIATELY FOR THE RHODESIAN BORDER
TOWN OF UMTALI, WHERE THE ANNUAL CONGRESS OF HIS RHODESIAN
FRONT PARTY WAS UNDER WAY.  THOUGH IT SEEMS HARD TO IMAGINE,
SMITH IS A MODERATE BY RHODESIAN STANDARDS, AND AT UMTALI
HE FACED A RIGHT-WING REVOLT LED BY PARTY CHAIRMAN
DESMOND FROST, WHO WOULD LIKE TO SPLIT RHODESIA INTO
BLACK AND WHITE SECTORS UNDER OVERALL WHITE CONTROL.
AFTER SIX HOURS OF SPEECHMAKING AND DEBATE, SMITH FORCED
THE ISSUE IN A DRAMATIC SCENE,'ARE YOU WITH MR OR ARE YOU
NOT?' HE DEMANDED.  'FOR GOD'S SAKE, BE HONEST'.  HE WON A
FIVE-MINUTE STANDING OVATION, AFTER WHICH THE CONGRESS
VOTED UNANIMOUSLY TO GIVE HIM 'A FREE HAND TO NEGOTIATE
IN FUTURE ON BEHALF OF ALL RHODESIANS.'

&quot;SOON SMITH WAS ON HIS WAY BACK TO SOUTH AFRICA FOR A
SATURDAY NIGHT RUGBY MATCH -- AND, AS IT TURNED OUT,
UNCLASSIFIED

UNCLASSIFIED

PAGE 12        STATE  233038 TOSEC 270408

THE MEETING HE WANTED WITH HENRY KISSINGER.  PREVIOUSLY,
THE SECRETARY HAD SAID HE WOULD TALK TO SMITH ONLY IF
HE WERE ASSURED IN ADVANCE OF 'MAJOR PROGRESS.'  IN THE
END, HE AGREED TO A SUNDAY MORNING MEETING IN ORDER TO
SUSTAIN THE MOMENTUM OF  HIS MISSION.

&quot;ON NAMIBIA, KISSINGER HAD REASON TO HOPE FOR SOME GENUINE
PROGRESS.   SOUTH AFRICA IS ALREADY COMMITTED TO THE PRIN-
CIPLE OF NAMIBIAN INDEPENDENCE, AND LAST MONTH A CON-
STITUTIONAL CONFERENCE IN WINDHOEK, THE NAMIBIAN CAPITAL,
SETTLED ON DECEMBER 31, 1978, AS THE DATE FOR THE TRANSFER
OF POWER.

&quot;THE BIGGEST SNAG IS THAT THE NEGOTIATORS AT WINDHOEK
DID NOT INCLUDE ANY REPRESENTATIVES OF THE SOUTH WEST
PEOPLE'S ORGANIZATION, THE LIBERATION -- AND GUERRILLA --
MOVEMENT THAT IS RECOGNIZED BY THE UNITED NATIONS AND
THE ORGANIZATION OF AFRICAN UNITY AS THE SOLE REPRESENTATIVE
OF THE NAMIBIAN PEOPLE.  KISSINGER'S FIRST CHORE WAS TO TRY
TO GET SOUTH AFRICA AND SWAPO TOGETHER OVER THE SAME

CONFERENCE TABLE, PERHAPS IN GENEVA.

&quot;KISSINGER'S SHUTTLE GOT OFF TO AN INAUSPICIOUS BEGINNING
LAST WEEK WHEN HE LANDED AT DAR ES SALAAM, TANZANIA.
ON ARRIVAL, HE FOUND THE TANZANIAN GOVERNMENT LESS
RECEPTIVE TO HIS MISSION THAN HE HAD HOPED.  STUDENT
DEMONSTRATORS, OBVIOUSLY ACTING WITH GOVERNMENT ACQUIESCENCE
GREETED THE SECRETARY WITH SIGNS BRANDING HIM A 'CYNICAL
MURDERER.'  LATER, AFTER FIVE HOURS OF TALKS, PRESIDENT
NYERERE TOLD NEWSMEN THAT HE FELT 'EVEN LESS HOPEFUL'
ABOUT NAMIBIA THAN HE HAD BEEN BEFORE.  BUT AT THE
VERY LEAST, NYERERE REMARKED, THE MISSION WOULD
CLARIFY US VIEWS ON SOUTHERN AFRICA.  IN THAT SENSE,
HE ADDED, 'A SHUTTLE OF CLARITY IS NOT A SHUTTLE OF
FAILURE.'

&quot;MAJORITY RULE:  KISSINGER'S SECOND HOST, ZAMBIA'S
PRESIDENT KAUNDA, WAS MORE ENTHUSIASTIC.  KAUNDA, AN
EMOTIONAL IDEALIST, WEPT AS HE SPOKE OF THE SEEMINGLY
INEXORABLE SLIDE OF SOUTHERN AFRICA TOWARD BLOODSHED AND
UNCLASSIFIED

UNCLASSIFIED

PAGE 13        STATE  233038 TOSEC 270408

WAR.  'WE DEMAND WHAT IS RIGHT AND FAIR AND JUST TO ALL
MEN,' HE ADDED, PLEDGING HIS COUNTRY TO FIGHT 'TO THE
LAST MAN IF NECESSARY,' FOR MAJORITY RULE IN ZIMBABWE,
THE AFRICAN NAME FOR RHODESIA.  AT THE END OF THEIR
DISCUSSIONS, KAUNDA OBSERVED OF KISSINGER:  'HIS HEART
IS IN THE RIGHT PLACE, AND HE HAS OUR PRAYERS.'  THE
SECRETARY RESPONDED THAT HE WOULD RETURN TO LUSAKA
AFTER HIS VISIT TO PRETORIA 'TO REPORT TO YOU, AND I PRAY
FOR ALL OF US THAT I CAN BRING YOU ENCOURAGING NEWS.'
AT WEEK'S END, AS KISSINGER PROCEEDED WITH HIS TALKS
IN SOUTH AFRICA  AND PREPARED TO REPORT BACK TO KAUNDA,
NYERERE AND OTHER AFRICAN LEADERS ON HIS WAY HOME,
IT WAS UNCERTAIN WHETHER HE WOULD HAVE MUCH ENCOURAGEMENT
TO OFFER.&quot;

3.  NEWSWEEK:

&quot;PLAYING BY THE AFRICAN RULES&quot;

&quot;EVEN FOR A DIPLOMAT AS SKILLED AS HENRY KISSINGER, BLACK
AFRICA WAS FULL OF UNSETTLING SURPRISES.  NONE OF HIS
PREVIOUS SHUTTLES FULLY PREPARED THE SECRETARY OF STATE
FOR THE NEGOTIATING STYLE HE ENCOUNTERED IN TANZANIA
AND ZAMBIA, AND HE SPENT A LARGE AND FRUSTRATING PART OF
HIS WEEK LEARNING THE RULES OF A NEW DIPLOMATIC GAME.

&quot;NEVER BEFORE HAD KISSINGER DEALT WITH SO MANY INTERESTED
PARTIES.  HIS NEGOTIATIONS WITH RUSSIA AND CHINA HAD BEEN
BILATERAL AFFAIRS, AND EVEN IN THE MIDDLE EAST HE HAD
BEEN REQUIRED, FOR THE MOST PART, TO WORK WITH ONLY TWO
NATIONS AT ONE TIME; THE TROUBLESOME PALESTINIANS WERE
EXCLUDED. IN BLACK AFRICA, FIVE 'FRONTLINE' NATIONS,
IN VARYING HUES OF RADICALISM, PLUS FOUR GUERRILLA
MOVEMENTS HAD TO BE CONSIDERED, AND MANY OF THEM WERE AT
ODDS WITH EACH OTHER.  MOST OF THE BLACK STATESMEN WERE IN
FAR WEAKER POSITONS POLITICALLY THAN A MAO TSE-TUNG OR AN
ANWAR SADAT -- AND THUS UNABLE TO DEAL AS FREELY.
AFTER TANZANIAN PRESIDENT J. NYERERE FOLLOWED UP HIS
PRIVATE EXPRESSIONS OF CAUTIOUS OPTIMISM WITH A PUBLIC
EXPRESSION OF DOUBT, US SOURCES SPOKE REPEATEDLY OF
NYERERE'S NEED 'TO SHORE UP HIS REVOLUTIONARY CREDENTIALS.'
UNCLASSIFIED

UNCLASSIFIED

PAGE 14        STATE  233038 TOSEC 270408


&quot;THE POETRY OF REVOLUTION RUNS STRONG IN AFRICA, AND
KISSINGER'S TALKS HAD A HIGH EMOTIONAL CONTENT.  MANY LEAD-
ERS OF BLACK NATIONS BEGAN THEIR STRUGGLE IN THE BUSH
AND LIKE TO SAY THAT THEY WON THEIR INDEPENDENCE THROUGH
REVOLUTIONARY STRUGGLE -- EVEN IF, IN SOME CASES,
THE COLONIAL POWERS MERELY WALKED AWAY AND HANDED THEM
THE KEYS.  EVEN THE MODERATE K. KAUNDA RESORTED TO
RADICAL RHETORIC, WARNING THAT IF THE SHUTTLE FAILED,
'WE WILL FIGHT -- TO THE LAST MAN IF NECESSARY.'

&quot;HONEST BROKER:KISSINGER'S USUAL STYLE IS TO MORE OR
LESS NAIL DOWN A GENERAL AGREEMENT BEFORE HE HIMSELF
APPEARS ON THE SCENE, AND THAT TAKES COOPERATION FROM
HIS OPPOSITE NUMBERS.  BUT THIS TIME, THE BLACK AFRICANS
WERE NOT EVEN COMMITTED TO THE IDEA OF NEGOTIATION.  'I
THINK THIS IS THE BASIC OBSTACLE -- THE RELUCTANCE OF ANY-
BODY TO ADMIT THAT NEGOTIATIONS CAN SUCCEED' KISSINGER SAID
IN DAR ES SALAAM.

&quot;A BIGGER OBSTACLE MAY HAVE BEEN THAT MANY BLACKS STILL

DID NOT COMPLETELY TRUST KISSINGER OR BELIEVE HIS CLAIMS
THAT HE WAS SIMPLY TRYING TO BE AN HONEST BROKER.  IN
TANZANIA, KISSINGER ASSERTED THAT THE US 'WILL DO WHAT
WE ARE ASKED TO DO ... WE WILL TAKE NO INITIATIVES THAT
ARE NOT INVITED, AND WHATEVER PROGRESS WILL OCCUR DEPENDS
OF THE ATTITUDE OF THE PARTIES AND THE GOODWILL OF THE
PARTICIPANTS.'

&quot;SOME FOREIGN DIPLOMATS, HOWEVER, ARGUED THAT KISSINGER
WOULD BE BETTER ADVISED TO ADMIT FRANKLY THAT THE US HAS
LARGE DIPLOMATIC, ECONOMIC AND STRATEGIC STAKES IN SOUTHERN
AFRICA.  AND SOME OF THE BLACK 'PARTIES' THEMSELVES HAD
DOUBTS ABOUT THE DEPTH OF AMERICAN GOODWILL.  IN A FORMAL
STATEMENT, THE TANZANIAN FOREIGN MINISTER ASKED:  'WHY
CANNOT THE AMERICAN GOVERNMENT ALSO SAY THAT IF A PEACEFUL
TRANSFER OR POWER IS IMPOSSIBLE BECAUSE OF THE INTRANS-

IGENCE OF THE RACISTS, THEN IT WILL BE ON THE SIDE OF
THOSE WHO FIGHT FOR FREEDON?'
UNCLASSIFIED

UNCLASSIFIED

PAGE 15        STATE  233038 TOSEC 270408


&quot;'OBSESSION':  SOME BLACKS, SUCH AS NYERERE, ALSO
COMPLAINED THAT THE US APPEARED TO BE SO AFRAID OF
SOVIET AND CUBAN PENETRATION IN SOUTHERN AFRICA THAT IT
CONFUSED BLACK NATIONALISM WITH A MARXIST BID FOR POWER.
'CUBA, CUBA, CUBA' STORMED NYERERE.  'I FIND THIS CUBAN
OBSESSION INCREDIBLE -- AND IT COMES FROM INTELLIGENT
PEOPLE.' 'THE AFRICANS WANT AN AFRICAN SOLUTION, NOT ONE
THAT FALLS INTO LINE WITH THE WESTERN VIEW OF THE WORLD,'

SAID A FOREIGN DIPLOMAT.   AN AFRICAN JOURNALIST ADDED:
'THEY HAVE LEARNED THAT THE WEST AND THE SOVIET
UNION PURSUE THEIR OWN GOALS, AND THEY ARE EQUALLY
CYNICAL ABOUT BOTH.'  WHETHER OR NOT SUCH JUDGMENTS WERE
FAIR, THEY WERE ONES THAT KISSINGER WOULD HAVE TO LIVE
WITH -- OR ADROITLY WORK HIS WAY AROUND.&quot;
(MARK STEVENS WITH JAMES PRINGLE IN LUSAKA AND DAR AND
MILTON R. BENJAMIN WITH KISSINGER'S PARTY).

1.  LA TIMES (JOHNSTON), PRETORIA:  &quot;KISSINGER, SMITH TALK
FOR 8 HOURS; RESULT UNCERTAIN&quot; - RHODESIAN PM SMITH MET
FOR NEARLY 8 HOURS SUNDAY WITH KISSINGER, THEN RETURNED
HOME WITHOUT COMMENTING ON ANGLO-AMERICAN PROPOSALS FOR
TRANSFERRING POWER TO HIS COUNTRY'S BLACK MAJORITY.

...U.S. OFFICIALS WERE UNUSUALLY RETICENT SUNDAY NIGHT AND
REFUSED TO PROVIDE DETAILS OF THE TALKS.

ON THE RECORD, KISSINGER WAS CLAIMING NO NEGOTIATING BREAK-
THROUGH--EVEN THOUGH KAUNDA AND NYERERE, IN PUBLIC STATE-
MENTS LAST WEEK, LEFT UNMISTAKABLE IMPRESSION THAT A
NEGOTIATING BREAKTHROUGH ON RHODESIA ISSUE WAS LEAST THAT
WOULD SATISFY THEM.
UNCLASSIFIED

UNCLASSIFIED

PAGE 02        STATE  233038 TOSEC 270408


THE BEST KISSINGER COULD OFFER SUNDAY WAS PROPOSITION,
DUBIOUS EVEN TO WHITE SOUTH AFRICAN LISTENERS, THAT &quot;IF
PROGRESS HAD NOT BEEN MADE, THERE WOULD BE NOTHING TO
REPORT TO THE RHODESIAN CABINET.&quot;

LATESUNDAY NIGHT A SPOKESMAN REPORTED THAT AFTER SMITH'S
DEPARTURE, VORSTER AND KISSINGER SPOKE FOR TWO AND A HALF
HOURS MORE ON OTHER MAIN SUBJECT ON THEIR AGENDA, NAMIBIA
(SOUTH-WEST AFRICA). WITHOUT GIVING ANY DETAILS, SPOKES-
MAN EAGLEBURGER SAID &quot;CONSIDERABLE PROGRESS WAS MADE&quot; ON
THIS ISSUE, WHICH INVOLVES DEVISING A MECHANISM ACCEPTABLE
TO BLACK AFRICANS FOR A TRANSFER OF AUTHORITY FROM SOUTH
AFRICA TO BLACK MAJORITY RULE THERE.

THERE WAS NO INFORMATION THAT WOULD BEAR OUT KISSINGER'S
EARLIER OPTIMISM CONVEYED TO REPORTERS ON THE WAY HERE
FROM ZAMBIA LAST FRIDAY.

... BY THE VERY ACT OF AGREEING TO SEE SMITH AT THIS STAGE
IN THE NEGOTIATIONS, KISSINGER HAS SIGNIFICANTLY RELAXED
THE BARGAINING PRECONDITIONS HE HAD EARLIER IMPOSED.

...BY LATE SATURDAY NIGHT, WHEN DECISION TO SEE SMITH WAS
TAKEN, REPORTERS WERE TOLD KISSINGER WISHED TO ESCAPE CON-
FINES OF THAT FORMULATION AND SEE SMITH ON THE MORE AMBI-
GUOUS GROUND THAT &quot;SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS&quot; IMMINENT.

THIS GAVE RISE TO REPORTS FROM BRITISH SOURCES THAT TWO-
YEAR TIMETABLE HAD BEEN SCRAPPED BY KISSINGER.  RHODESIAN
SOURCES SUNDAY CONFIRMED THAT SMITH WOULD ON NO ACCOUNT
ACCEPT A TWO-YEAR DEADLINE FOR BLACK AMJORITY RULE IN
HIS COUNTRY.... (SEPTEMBER 20)

2.  LA TIMES (JOHNSTON) PRETORIA (SEPTEMBER 18): &quot;KISSINGER
HINTS AT BREAKTHROUGH ON NAMIBIA FUTURE&quot; - KISSINGER
ARRIVED HERE FRIDAY TO BEGIN CRUCIAL STAGE OF HIS AFRICAN
MISSION, EXPRESSING UNUSUAL BUT PRECISELY QUALIFIED CON-
FIDENCE THAT AN IMPORTANT BREAKTHROUGH ON FUTURE OF NAMIBIA
(SOUTH-WEST AFRICA) MAY BE AT HAND.

UNCLASSIFIED

UNCLASSIFIED

PAGE 03        STATE  233038 TOSEC 270408

THROUGH A COMBINATION OF PUBLIC AND SEMIPRIVATE STATEMENTS
TO REPORTERS TRAVELING WITH OFFICIAL PARTY, KISSINGER AND
HIS AIDES CLEARLY INDICATED THEY EXPECT SOUTH AFRICAN
PM VORSTER TO MAKE AN IMPORTANT CONCESSION TO BLACK DEMANDS
ON ISSUE OF NAMIBIA, UN TRUST TERRITORY THAT SOUTH AFRICA
HOLDS UNDER DISPUTED CONTROL.

...IN PAST NEGOTIATIONS KISSINGER, AN ACCOMPLISHED STAGE
MANAGER, HAS ALWAYS SOUGHT TO CULTIVATE A PUBLIC APPEAR-
ANCE OF PROGRESS AND SUCCESS WHEN HE APPROACHES A TURN-
ING POINT IN HIS EFFORT.

ACCORDINGLY, CAREFULLY NURTURED HINTS OF PROBABLE SUCCESS
ON NAMIBIA AND POSSIBLE PROGRESS ON RHODESIA FIT IN WELL
WITH HIS METHODS.
BUT IT IS ALSO TRUE THAT KISSINGER RECEIVED A GENUINE
LIFT THURSDAY FROM ZAMBIAN PRESIDENT KAUNDA, WHOSE EMO-
TIONAL DECLARATION OF HOPE FOR KISSINGER'S MISSION AND OF
CONFIDENCE IN HIS MOTIVES CLEARLY BOOSTED THE MORALE OF
THE AMERICAN PARTY.

...AT KAUNDA'S REQUEST, HE MET FOR FIFTEEN MINUTES FRIDAY
MORNING IN LUSAKA WITH KNOMO, LEADER OF OLDEST, MOST
ESTABLISHED AND LEAST MILITANT OF BLACK RHODESIAN FACTIONS,
WHICH ARE PLANNING AN EXPANDED GUERRILLA CAMPAIGN THIS
FALL IF THE CURRENT DIPLOMATIC EFFORT PRODUCES NO IMMEDIATE
RESULT.

3.  LA TIMES (JOHNSTON), PRETORIA:  &quot;KISSINGER AND SMITH
TO MEET ON RHODESIA - 'SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS' CITED AS
REASON FOR BRINGING PM INTO TALKS&quot; - KISSINGER HAS DECIDED
TO MEET WITH RHODESIAN PM SMITH TO BRING SMITH DIRECTLY
INTO HIS DIPLOMATIC EFFORT TO AVOID RACE WAR IN SOUTHERN
AFRICA, U.S. OFFICIALS ANNOUNCED HERE EARLY TODAY.

...UNTIL RECENTLY, SUCH A MTG BETWEEN KISSINGER AND SMITH
HAD BEEN RULED OUT BECAUSE KISSINGER HAD REQUIRED AT LEAST
SMITH'S TACIT ACCEPTANCE OF BLACK MAJORITY RULE IN HIS
COUNTRY WITHIN TWO YEARS AS A PRECONDITION.  NOW STANDARDS
APPARENTLY HAVE BEEN RELAXED TO POINT THAT KISSINGER
AGREED TO SEE SMITH BECAUSE, IN HIS OWN JUDGMENT, &quot;SIGNI-
UNCLASSIFIED

UNCLASSIFIED

PAGE 04        STATE  233038 TOSEC 270408

FICANT PROGRESS&quot; HAS BEEN MADE TOWARD AN AGREEMENT ON
BLACK MAJORITY RULE.

BY LATE SATURDAY, REPORTERS WERE TOLD, KISSINGER BELIEVED
SOME PROGRESS HAD BEEN MADE ON RHODESIA, BUT THAT LATE
AFTERNOON SESSION BETWEEN VORSTER AND SMITH WOULD BE
NECESSARY BEFORE KISSINGER COULD RISK MEETING SMITH.

...KISSINGER, FRIDAY HINTED THAT SOUTH AFRICAN ACQUIESCENCE
IN BLACK NATIONALIST PARTICIPATION AT AN INTERNATIONAL
CONFERENCE ON FUTURE OF SOUTH-WEST AFRICAN TRUST TERRITORY
MIGHT BE WITHIN SIGHT.

BY SATURDAY, HOWEVER, IT WAS EVIDENT NO SUCH SUCCESS WAS
LIKELY TO EMERGE FROM CURRENT TALKS.

INSTEAD OF PRESSING FOR OUTRIGHT SOUTH AFRICAN ACCEPTANCE
OF SOUTH-WEST AFRICAN PEOPLES' ORGANIZATION AS A NEGOTIA-
TING PARTNER, IT WAS UNDERSTOOD FROM SOURCES CLOSE TO
TALKS THAT KISSINGER WAS TRYING TO DEVELOP ONE OF TORTUOUS
COMPROMISES FOR WHICH HE IS NOTED.  IT WOULD INVOLVE A
MULTI-STAGE CONFERENCE WITH DIFFERING LEVELS OF PARTICIPA-
TION BY VARIOUS NAMIBIAN GROUPS, AT DIFFERING TIMES.

AS IS CUSTOMARY WITH A KISSINGER-RUN NEGOTIATION AT MID-
POINT, PUBLIC KNOWLEDGE OF PROGRESS OF TALKS HAS BEEN
FRAGMENTARY, AMBIGUOUS AND EASILY SUSCEPTIBLE TO MANIPU-
LATION BY PARTICIPANTS.

BUT SEQUENCE OF EVENTS SINCE LAST WEDNESDAY, WHEN KISSINGER
MET WITH PRESIDENT NYERERE, APPEARED BEGINNING TO FALL
INTO A PATTERN -- ONE IN WHICH KISSINGER, THE GO-BETWEEN,
FIRST FOUND HIMSELF PRESSED FOR RESULTS BY NYERERE AND
OTHER BLACK AFRICAN LEADERS MORE HARSHLY THAN EXPECTED,
THEN LATER FOUND VORSTER UNWILLING TO BE AS COOPERATIVE
AS KISSINGERHAD EXPECTED.

RESULT, IT SEEMED SATURDAY, WAS THAT KISSINGER FOUND HIM-
SELF IN DANGER OF FACING A DEADLOCKED NEGOTIATION -- AND
THEREFORE A FAILED NEGOTIATION -- AT A POINT WHERE, ONLY
A WEEK AGO, HE MIGHT HAVE EXPECTED MORE PROGRESS POSSIBLE.

AS REPORTERS WERE TOLD SATURDAY, IT IS POSSIBLE TO CLAIM
CONSIDERABLE PROGRESS IN A NEGOTIATION, AND IN FACT TO
HAVE ACHIEVED PROGRESS, AND STILL HAVE IT BEEN DEEMED A
FAILURE.

HENCE, APPARENTLY, RESORT TO MTG WITH SMITH.  WHILE RELAX-
ING HIS STAND THAT IN RETURN FOR MTG SMITH MUST ACCEPT
PUBLICLY PRINCIPLE OF MAJORITY RULE, KISSINGER STILL IN-
SISTED UPON &quot;SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS.&quot;

...UNOFFICIAL REPORTS REACHING HERE SATURDAY FROM DAR ES
SALAAM SUGGESTED, MOROEVER, THAT NEGOTIATING HONEYMOON
BETWEEN KISSINGER AND NYERERE MAY BE OVER.  TANZANIAN
PRESIDENT WAS REPORTED TO BE INCENSED BY NEWS REPORTS
THAT A &quot;SENIOR OFFICIAL&quot; TRAVELING WITH KISSINGER, A UNI-
VERSALLY ACCEPTED DESIGNATION FOR THE SECRETARY HIMSELF,
HAD DISMISSED NYERERE'S PUBLIC PESSIMISM AT A NEWS CON-
FERENCE WEDNESDAY IN FAVOR OF WHAT WERE DESCRIBED TO BE
MORE MODERATE EXPRESSIONS IN PRIVATE CONVERSATION.

AT SAME TIME, CONCLUSION APPEARED UNAVOIDABLE THAT SMITH
HAD PLAYED A VERY ADROIT GAME TO MAKE QUESTION OF WHETHER
HE MET KISSINGER IN PRETORIA THIS WEEKEND SEEM CRUCIAL
ISSUES FACING KISSINGER-VORSTER TALKS.

...DURING MORNING, A GROUP OF RHODESIAN CITIZENS PRESENTED
THEMSELVES AT U.S. EMBASSY CHANCERY HERE, REQUESTING PER-
MISSION TO PRESENT A GIFT, AN OIL PORTRAIT OF KISSINGER
EXECUTED BY A RHODESIAN ARTIST.

FOLLOWING PROTOCOL FOR DEALING WITH NATIONALS OF A COUNTRY
WHICH U.S. DOES NOT RECOGNIZE, SECURITY GUARDS AT EMBASSY
POLITELY TURNED RHODESIANS AWAY WHILE ACCEPTING PORTRAIT.

SOON AFTERWARDS, MEMBERS OF SECRET SERVICE DETAIL GUARDING
KISSINGER WERE SEEN CARRYING PORTRAIT UPSTAIRS IN ELEVATOR
OF HOTEL IN WHICH KISSINGER PARTY IS STAYING.  IT APPEARED
THAT SMITH, HOWEVER VICARIOUSLY, HAD ONCE AGAIN SUCCEEDED
IN GETTING IN BACK WAY.  (SEPTEMBER 19)

HEADING:  &quot;PROGRESS IN PRETORIA&quot;

THE FIRST LEG OF HENRY KISSINGER'S AFRICAN SHUTTLE WAS
BEHIND HIM, AND IT HAD BEEN A ROUGH ONE.  NOW HE WAS FLYING
INTO A STATE BESIEGED.  WHEN KISSINGER ARRIVED IN SOUTH
AFRICA LAST WEEK, NEW BLACK RIOTS WERE ERUPTING IN
URBAN GHETTOS, AND AS HE DROVE INTO PRETORIA, THE
LOCAL NEWSPAPER CARRIED A GIANT PHOTOGRAPH OF HIM ALONG
WITH THE HEADLINE &quot;MAKE OR BREAK&quot;.  KISSINGER QUICKLY
BEGAN A ROUND OF TALKS WITH SOUTH AFRICAN PM JOHN VORSTER.
THEN, ONLY A DAY LATER, CAME THE SURPRISE ANNOUNCEMENT:
SECSTATE WOULD ALSO MEET WITH IAN SMITH, THE PM OF WHITE-
SUPREMACIST RHODESIA.                                  -

KISSINGER'S APPOINTMENT WITH THE STUBBORN LEADER OF
THE BREAKAWAY BRITISH COLONY SET OFF SPECULATION
THAT A BREAKTHROUGH WAS IMMINENT IN THE SEC'S EFFORT TO
HEAD OFF A RACE WAR IN SOUTHERN AFRICA.  HAK, IT SEEMED,
HAD ALREADY PERSUADED VORSTER TO SOFTEN HIS STAND ON
INDEPENDENCE FOR NAMIBIA, THE SOUTH AFRICAN-RULED TRUST
TERRITORY ALSO KNOWN AS SOUTHWEST AFRICA.  NOW, IT
APPEARED TO MANY PEOPLE THAT SMITH WAS RESPONDING TO
PRESSURE FROM KISSINGER -- AND PERHAPS FROM VORSTER, TOO.

WEEKS OF HELL:  SO FAR, NO ONE KNEW WHAT SECRET DIPLOMACY
LAY BEHIND THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE SUMMIT WITH SMITH.
BUT IT WAS WIDELY ASSUMED THAT THE RHODESIAN LEADER WAS
PREPARED TO MAKE AT LEAST PARTIAL CONCESSIONS.  THROUGH-
OUT THE SHUTTLE, THE AMERICANS HAD ACKNOWLEDGED THAT
KISSINGER COULD NOT RISK OFFENDING THE BLACK AFRICAN NATIONS
ON HIS ITINERARY BY MEETING WITH SMITH UNLESS SOMETHING
IMPORTANT WAS TO BE GAINED.  ONE SENIOR OFFICIAL IN THE
AMERICAN PARTY SAID THE SEC WOULD SIT DOWN WITH SMITH
ONLY IF HAK WAS &quot;ABLE TO REPORT TO THE BLACK PRESIDENTS
THAT SOME SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS WAS BEING MADE THAT THEY
WOULD RECOGNIZE AS SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS.&quot;  EVEN SO, THE
OFFICIAL ADDED, HAK &quot;MIGHT HAVE TO TAKE HELL FOR A FEW
UNCLASSIFIED

WEEKS&quot; IN BLACK AFRICA.  &quot;BUT IF AT THE END OF A FEW
WEEKS OR A MONTH THINGS ARE CONCLUDED, IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN
WORTH IT.&quot;

THE AMERICAN SECSTATE HAD JUST COME FROM TALKS WITH
TWO BLACK AFRICAN LEADERS, PRES JULIUS NYERERE OF TANZ-
ANIA AND PRES KENNETH KAUNDA OF ZAMBIA.  THERE HAK RAN
INTO SOMETHING FOR WHICH ALL HIS YEARS OF MIRACLE-WORKING
HAD NOT PREPARED HIM:  A STYLE OF DIPLOMACY IN WHICH HIS
HOSTS PRIVATELY GAVE HIM CAUTIOUS ENCOURAGEMENT -- AND
THEN PUBLICLY CAST DOUBT ON HIS MISSION.  ALTHOUGH
ANGERED BY THOSE TACTICS, HAK FELT THERE WAS REASON
ENOUGH TO CARRY ONE.

THE FIRST PART OF HAK'S AFRICAN JOURNEY, A TWO-DAY STOP
IN THE TANZANIAN CAPITAL OF DAR ES SALAAM, BEGAN BADLY.
HE WAS VISIBLY TAKEN ABACK WHEN A CROWD OF 200
DEMONSTRATORS MET HIM AT THE AIRPORT CHANTING &quot;GO HOME,
GO HOME&quot; AND WAVING SIGNS DENOUNCING HIM AS, AMONG OTHER
THINGS, THE &quot;TRAVELING CASHIER OF IMPERIALISM.&quot;  WHEN
THE DEMONSTRATORS CLIMBED INTO BUSES TO FOLLOW HIM
INTO TOWN, IT BECAME CLEAR THAT THE NOISY PROTEST
HAD BEEN GOVT SANCTIONED.  AT HIS HOTEL, HAK RESPONDED
WITH A BRUSQUE STATEMENT THAT THE TRIP TO AFRICA WAS
NOT HIS IDEA.  &quot;THIS INITIATIVE STARTED AT THE REQUEST
OF THE AFRICAN LEADERS DURING MY VISIT IN APRIL,&quot; HE
DECLARED.  &quot;EVERY STEP THAT HAS BROUGHT US HERE HAS BEEN
CAREFULLY DISCUSSED WITH LEADERS IN AFRICA AND ESPECIALLY
THE (BLACK)PRESIDENTS.&quot;

UPBEAT:  THE NEXT MORNING, HAK CHIDED PRES NYERERE ABOUT
THE DEMONSTRATIONS, AND THE 54-YEAR-OLD TANZANIAN LEADER
REPLIED THAT HE COULD NOT CONTROL SUCH OUTPOURINGS IN
A DEMOCRACY.  NONETHELESS, SOURCES SAID THE MOOD OF THE
FOUR-HOUR MEETING WAS GENERALLY FRIENDLY AND UPBEAT.
AT A PRESS CONFERENCE LATER, NYERERE PRAISED HAK'S JOURNEY
AS A &quot;SHUTTLE OF CLARITY&quot; AND REJECTED THE IDEA THAT IT
WAS DOOMED TO FAILURE.  BUT THEN NYERERE GAVE HAK THE BACK
OF HIS HAND.  &quot;REALLY, ON THE BASIS OF WHAT I KNOW UP TO
NOW,&quot; HE OBSERVED, &quot;I COULD EVEN SAY I AM LESS HOPEFUL THAN
I WAS.&quot;
UNCLASSIFIED

PAGE 08        STATE  233038 TOSEC 270408


ONE DIPLOMAT IN DAR ES SALAAM INTERPRETED NYERERE'S CURT
STATEMENT AS AN ATTEMPT TO &quot;COVER HIS REAR IN CASE THE
HAK MISSION FAILS AND ALSO APPEASE HARD-LINE ELEMENTS WHO
DISTRUST HAK'S MOTIVES.&quot;  HAK HIMSELF, THOUGH SURPRISED,
BRUSHED ASIDE NYERERE'S REMARKS AS A MATTER OF NEGOTIATING
TACTICS.  HAK'S PUBLIC RECEPTION WAS WARMER IN THE ZAM-
BIAN CAPITAL OF LUSAKA.  FORNMIN SITEKE MWALE GREETED
HIM AT THE AIRPORT WITH AN EMBRACE AND PRES KAUNDA LATER
ASSURED THE AMERICAN THAT HE WAS PRAYING HARD FOR HIS
SUCCESS.  BUT AS THE TWO MEN SAT ACROSS FROM EACH OTHER AT
A CONFERENCE TABLE IN THE RED BRICK STATE HOUSE, KAUNDA
ISSUED A BLUNT WARNING.  &quot;YOU HAVE ONLY A FEW DAYS -- NOT
WEEKS -- TO SUCCEED,&quot; HE SAID.  &quot;IF YOU FAIL, WE SHALL
HAVE REACHED THE POINT OF NO RETURN.&quot;

EMOTION:  THE 52-YEAR-OLD KAUNDA, A MODERATE WHO IS OFTEN
CALLED THE &quot;CONSCIENCE OF AFRICA,&quot; WAS SOON OVERCOME BY
EMOTION, DABBING AT HIS EYES WITH A WHITE HANDKERCHIEF.
VISIBLY TOUCHED, HAK RESPONDED:  &quot;I PRAY FOR ALL OF US --
FOR YOUR PEOPLE AND OUR PEOPLE -- THAT I CAN BRING YOU
ENCOURAGING NEWS.&quot;  AFTER HIS TALKS WITH KAUNDA, HAK
MET BRIEFLY WITH JOSHUA NKOMO, LEADER OF ONE OF THE
BLACK FACTIONS FIGHTING IN RHODESIA.  PERHAPS TO DIVERT
NEWSMEN, KAUNDA HELD AN IMPROMPTU PRESS CONFERENCE, IN
WHICH HIS VIEWS ON THE HAK SHUTTLE WERE LESS FERVID.  HE
CALLED HIS TALKS WITH THE SEC &quot;USEFUL DISCUSSIONS,&quot;
BUT ADDED:  &quot;I DIDN'T EXPECT HIM TO BRING ANYTHING NEW.&quot;

AS HAK LEFT LUSAKA FOR HIS MEETING WITH VORSTER, SOUTH
AFRICA ITSELF WAS IN TURMOIL.  IN CAPE TOWN, POLICE HAD
OPENED FIRE ON COLORED DEMONSTRATORS.  IN JOHANNESBURG,
FIRE BOMBS EXPLODED IN TWO DEPT STORES, AND BLACKS STONED
BUSES CARRYING WHITE COMMUTERS -- THE FIRST OMINOUS
SIGNS OF TERRORISM DELIBERATELY AIMED AT WHITES.  AT
ALMOST THE SAME TIME THAT HAK'S PLANE TOUCHED DOWN AT
WATERKLOOF MILITARY AIRPORT, BLACK STUDENTS IN SOWETO
STAGED A MASS MARCH, CARRYING BANNERS READING &quot;KISSINGER
IS A KILLER&quot; AND SINGING PROTEST SONGS.  WHEN THE
CROWD TRIED TO MARCH ON NEARBY JOHANNESBURG AND IGNORED
A WARNING TO TURN BACK, POLICE SHOT THREE OF THEM DEAD.

THEOLOGY:  EVEN SO, HAK APPEARED OPTIMISTIC FOR PROGRESS
IN HIS TALKS WITH VORSTER ON THE ISSUE OF NAMIBIA.  VORSTER,
HE THOUGHT, MIGHT AGREE TO INDEPENDENCE FOR THE DISPUTED
TERRITORY BY THE END OF NEXT YEAR, A YEAR AHEAD OF THE
CURRENT SCHEDULE.  HAK ALSO WAS PRESSING VORSTER TO
INCLUDE IN FUTURE TALKS ON NAMIBIA THE PRINCIPAL BLACK
GUERRILLA GROUP THERE, THE SWAPO.  BUT THERE WERE STILL
MANY QUESTIONS TO BE RESOLVED THAT COULD BLOCK PROGRESS
TOWARD A SETTLEMENT.  &quot;THE NAMIBIAN THING IS DOWN NOW TO
THEOLOGICAL POINTS THAT MEAN A HELL OF A LOT TO THE
PARTICIPANTS,&quot; SAID A SENIOR OFFICIAL IN KISSINGER'S PARTY.
&quot;AND THAT MAY BLOW IT SKY HIGH.&quot;

AS THE DISCUSSIONS CONTINUED, SMITH FLEW TO SOUTH AFRICA.
AT THE OUTSET OF THE HAK SHUTTLE, PROGRESS ON RHODESIA
WAS THOUGHT TO BE A LOT LESS LIKELY THAN AGREEMENT ON
NAMIBIA.  BUT THEN VORSTER WENT TO WORK ON HIS
GUEST.  THEY MET FIRST AT VORSTER'S HILLTOP RESIDENCE
(SMITH ARRIVED ONLY MINUTES AFTER KISSINGER HAD LEFT
FOR A MEETING WITH SOUTH AFRICAN OPPOSITION LEADERS).
THEN THE TWO MEN ATTENDED A RUGBY FOOTBALL MATCH.  THAT
EVENING, HAK JOINED VORSTER FOR DINNER, AND AFTERWARD
US SPOKESMAN LAWRENCE EAGLEBURGER MADE THE ANNOUNCEMENT:
&quot;THE SECRETARY WILL MEET WITH PRIME MINISTER SMITH AT
9:30 (THE NEXT MORNING) AT THE AMERICAN AMBASSADOR'S
RESIDENCE.&quot;

EAGLEBURGER BRUSHED ASIDE ALL QUESTIONS, AND THERE WAS NO
INDICATION OF WHAT PRICE -- IF ANY -- KISSINGER HAD EX-
TRACTED FROM SMITH IN RETURN FOR THE MEETING.  SO FAR,
THE RHODESIAN LEADER HAD ADAMANTLY REJECTED DEMANDS FOR
BLACK MAJORITY RULE IN HIS COUNTRY.   THERE WAS NO EV-
IDENCE THAT HE WOULD CAVE IN BEFORE KISSINGER.  BUT IT
WAS EQUALLY UNLIKELY THAT HAK WOULD HAVE AGREED TO THE
MEETING WITHOUT SOME REASON TO HOPE FOR AT LEAST PRIVATE
ASSURANCES OF PROGRESS TOWARD A SETTLEMENT.  WHATEVER
TRANSPIRED WITH SMITH, THE FIRST WEEK OF KISSINGER'S
AFRICAN SHUTTLE HAD ALREADY PRODUCED MORE RESULTS THAN
MANY PEOPLE HAD EXPECTED.

PARTY AND PETER YOUNGHUSBAND IN CAPE TOWN

2.  TIME MAGAZINE, SEPTEMBER 27 ISSUE:

&quot;SOUTHERN AFRICA: SHUTTLING BETWEEN BLACK AND WHITE&quot;

&quot;SCORES OF SOLDIERS AND POLICE, AS WELL AS AN ALL-BLACK
HONOR GUARD, WERE ON HAND TO GREET HENRY KISSINGER AS HE A
ARRIVED IN THE SOUTH AFRICAN CAPITAL OF PRETORIA LATE LAST
WEEK ON THE THIRD STOP OF HIS LATEST EFFORT AT SHUTTLE
DIPLOMACY.  ALL WEEK LONG SPORADIC RIOTING HAD CONTINUED
IN THE NONWHITE TOWNSHIPS AROUND JOHANNESBURG AND CAPE
TOWN, AND A DEPARTMENT STORE IN DOWNTOWN JOHANNESBURG
WAS FIRE-BOMBED -- THE FIRST SUCH ACT OF URBAN TERRORISM
IN THE COUNTRY'S HISTORY.  SHORTLY BEFORE KISSINGER'S
BLUE AND WHITE 707 TOUCHED DOWN, POLICE FIRED AT
DEMONSTRATORS IN JOHANNESBURG'S SOWETO TOWNSHIP, KILLING
SIX STUDENTS AND WOUNDING 35.  IN NO TIME, RUMORS WERE
CIRCULTATING IN LONDON, NEW YORK AND ELSEWHERE THAT THE
SECRETARY HAD BEEN ASSASSINATED.  PARAPHRASING MARK
TWAIN, KISSINGER QUICKLY RETORTED THAT THE REPORTS OF HIS
'HAVING BEEN SHOT WERE GROSSLY EXAGGERATED.'

&quot;BRUTAL TALK:  THE SECRETARY DID NOT FIND MANY OPPORTUNITIES
FOR JOCULARITY IN HIS ATTEMPT TO HEAD OFF BY NEGOTIATION
THE RACIAL ARMAGEDDON THAT SEEMS TO BE LOOMING IN SOUTHERN
AFRICA. TANZANIA'S PRESIDENT J. NYERERE HAD ANNOUNCED
THAT HE WAS NOT 'PARTICULARLY ENCOURAGED' BY KISSINGER'S
MISSION. ZAMBIA'S PRESIDENT K. KAUNDA HAD DECLARED THAT
KISSINGER MIGHT HAVE 'ONLY A FEW DAYS, NOT WEEKS' TO
SUCCEED IN AVERTING A BLACK-WHITE WAR.

&quot;WHEN KISSINGER ARRIVED IN PRETORIA, HE HAD NO EXPECTATION
OF BRINGING ABOUT ANY CHANGE IN SOUTH AFRICA'S CHERISHED
SYSTEM OF APARTHEID, OR 'SEPARATE DEVELOPMENT.'    BUT
HE WAS ANXIOUS TO SEE WHETHER A ROUND OF SUSTAINED
NEGOTIATIONS COULD END THE IMPASSE OVER RHODESIA, WHOSE
WHITE MINORITY GOVERNMENT BROKE AWAY FROM BRITISH RULE
ELEVEN YEARS AGO.  AND HE WAS PARTICULARLY HOPEFUL THAT IF
ALL :LSE FAILED, HE COULD ACHIEVE SOME MEASURED PROGRESS
UNCLASSIFIED

ON NAMIBIA,  OR S-W AFRICA, THE ONETIME LEAGUE OF NATIONS
TERRITORY THAT SOUTH AFRICA HAS RULED SINCE 1920.

&quot;SOUTH AFRICAN PRIME MINISTER J. VORSTER MADE IT CLEAR
FROM THE BEGINNING THAT HIS DISCUSSIONS WITH KISSINGER
WOULD NOT DEAL WITH SOUTH AFRICA ITSELF.  IF VORSTER
IS DETERMINED TO MAINTAIN WHITE RULE AT HOME, HE IS ALSO
CONVINCED, HOWEVER, THAT IT CAN NO LONGER BE UPHELD IN
EITHER RHODESIA OR NAMIBIA.  BY AGREEING TO A TRANSITION
TO MAJORITY RULE IN THOSE TERRITORIES, HE BELIEVES SOUTH
AFRICA CAN GAIN ENOUGH TIME FOR ITSELF TO BUILD LASTING
TIES WITH ITS BLACK NEIGHBORS.  AT ZURICH TWO WEEKS AGO,
VORSTER HINTED TO KISSINGER THAT HE WAS PREPARED TO STEP
UP THE PRESSURE ON RHODESIAN PRIME MINISTER IAN SMITH.
ACCORDINGLY, VORSTER LAST WEEK TREATED SMITH TO A DUTCH
UNCLE TALK THAT ONE DIPLOMAT DESCRIBED AS 'TOUGH TO THE
POINT OF BRUTALITY.'  EVIDENTLY, HE WARNED SMITH THAT
PRETORIA'S FUTURE CAPACITY FOR HELPING RHODESIA WILL BE
INCREASINGLY LIMITED.  AS SMITH WELL KNOWS, AN ESTIMATED
$100 MILLION WORTH OF RHODESIAN BULK EXPORTS OF CORN,
MINERALS AND TOBACCO ARE ALREADY HELD UP ON THE RHODESIAN
SIDE OF THE BORDER FOR LACK OF SPACE ON SOUTH AFRICA'S
CROWDED RAIL LINES TO CARRY THEM TO THE SEA.

&quot;BE HONEST:  SMITH LEFT THE MEETING LOOKING PALE AND
ANGRY.  HE TOOK OFF IMMEDIATELY FOR THE RHODESIAN BORDER
TOWN OF UMTALI, WHERE THE ANNUAL CONGRESS OF HIS RHODESIAN
FRONT PARTY WAS UNDER WAY.  THOUGH IT SEEMS HARD TO IMAGINE,
SMITH IS A MODERATE BY RHODESIAN STANDARDS, AND AT UMTALI
HE FACED A RIGHT-WING REVOLT LED BY PARTY CHAIRMAN
DESMOND FROST, WHO WOULD LIKE TO SPLIT RHODESIA INTO
BLACK AND WHITE SECTORS UNDER OVERALL WHITE CONTROL.
AFTER SIX HOURS OF SPEECHMAKING AND DEBATE, SMITH FORCED
THE ISSUE IN A DRAMATIC SCENE,'ARE YOU WITH MR OR ARE YOU
NOT?' HE DEMANDED.  'FOR GOD'S SAKE, BE HONEST'.  HE WON A
FIVE-MINUTE STANDING OVATION, AFTER WHICH THE CONGRESS
VOTED UNANIMOUSLY TO GIVE HIM 'A FREE HAND TO NEGOTIATE
IN FUTURE ON BEHALF OF ALL RHODESIANS.'

&quot;SOON SMITH WAS ON HIS WAY BACK TO SOUTH AFRICA FOR A
SATURDAY NIGHT RUGBY MATCH -- AND, AS IT TURNED OUT,
UNCLASSIFIED

UNCLASSIFIED

PAGE 12        STATE  233038 TOSEC 270408

THE MEETING HE WANTED WITH HENRY KISSINGER.  PREVIOUSLY,
THE SECRETARY HAD SAID HE WOULD TALK TO SMITH ONLY IF
HE WERE ASSURED IN ADVANCE OF 'MAJOR PROGRESS.'  IN THE
END, HE AGREED TO A SUNDAY MORNING MEETING IN ORDER TO
SUSTAIN THE MOMENTUM OF  HIS MISSION.

&quot;ON NAMIBIA, KISSINGER HAD REASON TO HOPE FOR SOME GENUINE
PROGRESS.   SOUTH AFRICA IS ALREADY COMMITTED TO THE PRIN-
CIPLE OF NAMIBIAN INDEPENDENCE, AND LAST MONTH A CON-
STITUTIONAL CONFERENCE IN WINDHOEK, THE NAMIBIAN CAPITAL,
SETTLED ON DECEMBER 31, 1978, AS THE DATE FOR THE TRANSFER
OF POWER.

&quot;THE BIGGEST SNAG IS THAT THE NEGOTIATORS AT WINDHOEK
DID NOT INCLUDE ANY REPRESENTATIVES OF THE SOUTH WEST
PEOPLE'S ORGANIZATION, THE LIBERATION -- AND GUERRILLA --
MOVEMENT THAT IS RECOGNIZED BY THE UNITED NATIONS AND
THE ORGANIZATION OF AFRICAN UNITY AS THE SOLE REPRESENTATIVE
OF THE NAMIBIAN PEOPLE.  KISSINGER'S FIRST CHORE WAS TO TRY
TO GET SOUTH AFRICA AND SWAPO TOGETHER OVER THE SAME

CONFERENCE TABLE, PERHAPS IN GENEVA.

&quot;KISSINGER'S SHUTTLE GOT OFF TO AN INAUSPICIOUS BEGINNING
LAST WEEK WHEN HE LANDED AT DAR ES SALAAM, TANZANIA.
ON ARRIVAL, HE FOUND THE TANZANIAN GOVERNMENT LESS
RECEPTIVE TO HIS MISSION THAN HE HAD HOPED.  STUDENT
DEMONSTRATORS, OBVIOUSLY ACTING WITH GOVERNMENT ACQUIESCENCE
GREETED THE SECRETARY WITH SIGNS BRANDING HIM A 'CYNICAL
MURDERER.'  LATER, AFTER FIVE HOURS OF TALKS, PRESIDENT
NYERERE TOLD NEWSMEN THAT HE FELT 'EVEN LESS HOPEFUL'
ABOUT NAMIBIA THAN HE HAD BEEN BEFORE.  BUT AT THE
VERY LEAST, NYERERE REMARKED, THE MISSION WOULD
CLARIFY US VIEWS ON SOUTHERN AFRICA.  IN THAT SENSE,
HE ADDED, 'A SHUTTLE OF CLARITY IS NOT A SHUTTLE OF
FAILURE.'

&quot;MAJORITY RULE:  KISSINGER'S SECOND HOST, ZAMBIA'S
PRESIDENT KAUNDA, WAS MORE ENTHUSIASTIC.  KAUNDA, AN
EMOTIONAL IDEALIST, WEPT AS HE SPOKE OF THE SEEMINGLY
INEXORABLE SLIDE OF SOUTHERN AFRICA TOWARD BLOODSHED AND
UNCLASSIFIED

UNCLASSIFIED

PAGE 13        STATE  233038 TOSEC 270408

WAR.  'WE DEMAND WHAT IS RIGHT AND FAIR AND JUST TO ALL
MEN,' HE ADDED, PLEDGING HIS COUNTRY TO FIGHT 'TO THE
LAST MAN IF NECESSARY,' FOR MAJORITY RULE IN ZIMBABWE,
THE AFRICAN NAME FOR RHODESIA.  AT THE END OF THEIR
DISCUSSIONS, KAUNDA OBSERVED OF KISSINGER:  'HIS HEART
IS IN THE RIGHT PLACE, AND HE HAS OUR PRAYERS.'  THE
SECRETARY RESPONDED THAT HE WOULD RETURN TO LUSAKA
AFTER HIS VISIT TO PRETORIA 'TO REPORT TO YOU, AND I PRAY
FOR ALL OF US THAT I CAN BRING YOU ENCOURAGING NEWS.'
AT WEEK'S END, AS KISSINGER PROCEEDED WITH HIS TALKS
IN SOUTH AFRICA  AND PREPARED TO REPORT BACK TO KAUNDA,
NYERERE AND OTHER AFRICAN LEADERS ON HIS WAY HOME,
IT WAS UNCERTAIN WHETHER HE WOULD HAVE MUCH ENCOURAGEMENT
TO OFFER.&quot;

3.  NEWSWEEK:

&quot;PLAYING BY THE AFRICAN RULES&quot;

&quot;EVEN FOR A DIPLOMAT AS SKILLED AS HENRY KISSINGER, BLACK
AFRICA WAS FULL OF UNSETTLING SURPRISES.  NONE OF HIS
PREVIOUS SHUTTLES FULLY PREPARED THE SECRETARY OF STATE
FOR THE NEGOTIATING STYLE HE ENCOUNTERED IN TANZANIA
AND ZAMBIA, AND HE SPENT A LARGE AND FRUSTRATING PART OF
HIS WEEK LEARNING THE RULES OF A NEW DIPLOMATIC GAME.

&quot;NEVER BEFORE HAD KISSINGER DEALT WITH SO MANY INTERESTED
PARTIES.  HIS NEGOTIATIONS WITH RUSSIA AND CHINA HAD BEEN
BILATERAL AFFAIRS, AND EVEN IN THE MIDDLE EAST HE HAD
BEEN REQUIRED, FOR THE MOST PART, TO WORK WITH ONLY TWO
NATIONS AT ONE TIME; THE TROUBLESOME PALESTINIANS WERE
EXCLUDED. IN BLACK AFRICA, FIVE 'FRONTLINE' NATIONS,
IN VARYING HUES OF RADICALISM, PLUS FOUR GUERRILLA
MOVEMENTS HAD TO BE CONSIDERED, AND MANY OF THEM WERE AT
ODDS WITH EACH OTHER.  MOST OF THE BLACK STATESMEN WERE IN
FAR WEAKER POSITONS POLITICALLY THAN A MAO TSE-TUNG OR AN
ANWAR SADAT -- AND THUS UNABLE TO DEAL AS FREELY.
AFTER TANZANIAN PRESIDENT J. NYERERE FOLLOWED UP HIS
PRIVATE EXPRESSIONS OF CAUTIOUS OPTIMISM WITH A PUBLIC
EXPRESSION OF DOUBT, US SOURCES SPOKE REPEATEDLY OF
NYERERE'S NEED 'TO SHORE UP HIS REVOLUTIONARY CREDENTIALS.'
UNCLASSIFIED

UNCLASSIFIED

PAGE 14        STATE  233038 TOSEC 270408


&quot;THE POETRY OF REVOLUTION RUNS STRONG IN AFRICA, AND
KISSINGER'S TALKS HAD A HIGH EMOTIONAL CONTENT.  MANY LEAD-
ERS OF BLACK NATIONS BEGAN THEIR STRUGGLE IN THE BUSH
AND LIKE TO SAY THAT THEY WON THEIR INDEPENDENCE THROUGH
REVOLUTIONARY STRUGGLE -- EVEN IF, IN SOME CASES,
THE COLONIAL POWERS MERELY WALKED AWAY AND HANDED THEM
THE KEYS.  EVEN THE MODERATE K. KAUNDA RESORTED TO
RADICAL RHETORIC, WARNING THAT IF THE SHUTTLE FAILED,
'WE WILL FIGHT -- TO THE LAST MAN IF NECESSARY.'

&quot;HONEST BROKER:KISSINGER'S USUAL STYLE IS TO MORE OR
LESS NAIL DOWN A GENERAL AGREEMENT BEFORE HE HIMSELF
APPEARS ON THE SCENE, AND THAT TAKES COOPERATION FROM
HIS OPPOSITE NUMBERS.  BUT THIS TIME, THE BLACK AFRICANS
WERE NOT EVEN COMMITTED TO THE IDEA OF NEGOTIATION.  'I
THINK THIS IS THE BASIC OBSTACLE -- THE RELUCTANCE OF ANY-
BODY TO ADMIT THAT NEGOTIATIONS CAN SUCCEED' KISSINGER SAID
IN DAR ES SALAAM.

&quot;A BIGGER OBSTACLE MAY HAVE BEEN THAT MANY BLACKS STILL

DID NOT COMPLETELY TRUST KISSINGER OR BELIEVE HIS CLAIMS
THAT HE WAS SIMPLY TRYING TO BE AN HONEST BROKER.  IN
TANZANIA, KISSINGER ASSERTED THAT THE US 'WILL DO WHAT
WE ARE ASKED TO DO ... WE WILL TAKE NO INITIATIVES THAT
ARE NOT INVITED, AND WHATEVER PROGRESS WILL OCCUR DEPENDS
OF THE ATTITUDE OF THE PARTIES AND THE GOODWILL OF THE
PARTICIPANTS.'

&quot;SOME FOREIGN DIPLOMATS, HOWEVER, ARGUED THAT KISSINGER
WOULD BE BETTER ADVISED TO ADMIT FRANKLY THAT THE US HAS
LARGE DIPLOMATIC, ECONOMIC AND STRATEGIC STAKES IN SOUTHERN
AFRICA.  AND SOME OF THE BLACK 'PARTIES' THEMSELVES HAD
DOUBTS ABOUT THE DEPTH OF AMERICAN GOODWILL.  IN A FORMAL
STATEMENT, THE TANZANIAN FOREIGN MINISTER ASKED:  'WHY
CANNOT THE AMERICAN GOVERNMENT ALSO SAY THAT IF A PEACEFUL
TRANSFER OR POWER IS IMPOSSIBLE BECAUSE OF THE INTRANS-

IGENCE OF THE RACISTS, THEN IT WILL BE ON THE SIDE OF
THOSE WHO FIGHT FOR FREEDON?'
UNCLASSIFIED

UNCLASSIFIED

PAGE 15        STATE  233038 TOSEC 270408


&quot;'OBSESSION':  SOME BLACKS, SUCH AS NYERERE, ALSO
COMPLAINED THAT THE US APPEARED TO BE SO AFRAID OF
SOVIET AND CUBAN PENETRATION IN SOUTHERN AFRICA THAT IT
CONFUSED BLACK NATIONALISM WITH A MARXIST BID FOR POWER.
'CUBA, CUBA, CUBA' STORMED NYERERE.  'I FIND THIS CUBAN
OBSESSION INCREDIBLE -- AND IT COMES FROM INTELLIGENT
PEOPLE.' 'THE AFRICANS WANT AN AFRICAN SOLUTION, NOT ONE
THAT FALLS INTO LINE WITH THE WESTERN VIEW OF THE WORLD,'

SAID A FOREIGN DIPLOMAT.   AN AFRICAN JOURNALIST ADDED:
'THEY HAVE LEARNED THAT THE WEST AND THE SOVIET
UNION PURSUE THEIR OWN GOALS, AND THEY ARE EQUALLY
CYNICAL ABOUT BOTH.'  WHETHER OR NOT SUCH JUDGMENTS WERE
FAIR, THEY WERE ONES THAT KISSINGER WOULD HAVE TO LIVE
WITH -- OR ADROITLY WORK HIS WAY AROUND.&quot;
