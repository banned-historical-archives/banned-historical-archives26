		<h3>Tor</h3>
		<p><a href="https://www.torproject.org">Tor</a> is an encrypted anonymising network that makes it harder to intercept internet communications, or see where communications are coming from or going to.</p>
		<p>In order to use the WikiLeaks public submission system as detailed above you can download the Tor Browser Bundle, which is a Firefox-like browser available for Windows, Mac OS X and GNU/Linux and pre-configured to connect using the anonymising system Tor.</p>
		<h4>Tails</h4>
		<p>If you are at high risk and you have the capacity to do so, you can also access the submission system through a secure operating system called <a href="https://tails.boum.org">Tails</a>. Tails is an operating system launched from a USB stick or a DVD that aim to leaves no traces when the computer is shut down after use and automatically routes your internet traffic through Tor. Tails will require you to have either a USB stick or a DVD at least 4GB big and a laptop or desktop computer.</p>

		<h3>Tips</h3>
		<p>Our submission system works hard to preserve your anonymity, but we recommend you also take some of your own precautions. Please review these basic guidelines. </p>
		<div>
			<h4>1. Contact us if you have specific problems</h4>
			<p>If you have a very large submission, or a submission with a complex format, or are a high-risk source, please <a href="#submit_help_contact">contact us</a>. In our experience it is always possible to find a custom solution for even the most seemingly difficult situations.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h4>2. What computer to use</h4>
			<p>If the computer you are uploading from could subsequently be audited in an investigation, consider using a computer that is not easily tied to you. Technical users can also use <a href="https://tails.boum.org">Tails</a> to help ensure you do not leave any records of your submission on the computer.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h4>3. Do not talk about your submission to others</h4>
			<p>If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in source protection – it is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This includes other media organisations.</p>
		</div>

	</div>

		<h3>After</h3>

		<div>
			<h4>1. Do not talk about your submission to others</h4>
			<p>If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in source protection – it is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This includes other media organisations.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h4>2. Act normal</h4>
			<p>If you are a high-risk source, avoid saying anything or doing anything after submitting which might promote suspicion. In particular, you should try to stick to your normal routine and behaviour.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h4>3. Remove traces of your submission</h4>
			<p>If you are a high-risk source and the computer you prepared your submission on, or uploaded it from, could subsequently be audited in an investigation, we recommend that you format and dispose of the computer hard drive and any other storage media you used.</p>
			<p>In particular, hard drives retain data after formatting which may be visible to a digital forensics team and flash media (USB sticks, memory cards and SSD drives) retain data even after a secure erasure. If you used flash media to store sensitive data, it is important to destroy the media.</p>
			<p>If you do this and are a high-risk source you should make sure there are no traces of the clean-up, since such traces themselves may draw suspicion.</p>
			<div>
				<h4>4. If you face legal action</h4>
				<p>If a legal action is brought against you as a result of your submission, there are organisations that may help you. The Courage Foundation is an international organisation dedicated to the protection of journalistic sources. You can find more details at <a href="https://www.couragefound.org">https://www.couragefound.org</a>.</p>

		<p>WikiLeaks publishes documents of political or historical importance that are censored or otherwise suppressed. We specialise in strategic global publishing and large archives.</p>
		<p>The following is the address of our secure site where you can anonymously upload your documents to WikiLeaks editors. You can only access this submissions system through Tor. (See our <a href="#submit_help_tor">Tor tab</a> for more information.) We also advise you to read our <a href="#submit_help_tips">tips for sources</a> before submitting.</p>

			<!--<div>
				Copy this address into your Tor browser. Advanced users, if they wish, can also add a further layer of encryption to their submission using <a href="#submit_wlkey">our public PGP key</a>.
			</div>-->
		</div>

		<p>If you cannot use Tor, or your submission is very large, or you have specific requirements, WikiLeaks provides several alternative methods. <a href="#submit_help_contact">Contact us</a> to discuss how to proceed.</p>

1. (C) SUMMARY: PREMIER HUA'S 28 OCTOBER-3 NOVEMBER VISIT
TO GREAT BRITAIN WAS &quot;AN UNQUALIFIED SUCCESS&quot; AS MEASURED
AGAINST THE MODEST STANDARDS SET, AND THE CHINESE WENT
AWAY HAPPY. THAT SAID, THERE WAS A DETECTABLE FEELING
THAT BOTH SIDES WERE GOING THROUGH THE MOTIONS. HIGH LEVEL
EXCHANGES OF VIEWS TOOK PLACE ON TWO FRONTS: WORLD
ISSUES, WHERE HUA DID MOST OF THE TALKING AND SAID LITTLE
NEW; AND BILATERAL ISSUES, WHERE THE INITIATIVE CAME MOSTLY
FROM THE BRITISH SIDE ON HONG KONG'S REFUGEE PROBLEMS AND

TRADE. THE TWO SIDES SIGNED A CULTURAL AGREEMENT AND AN
AIR SERVICES AGREEMENT THAT WILL ALLOW DIRECT FLIGHTS FROM
HONG KONG TO CHINESE CITIES. AS ANTICIPATED, HUA INDULGED
IN MORE OVERT PUBLIC SOVIET-BASHING HERE THAN ON OTHER
STOPS. THATCHER SMILED BUT DID NOT JOIN IN. THE PREMIER
MADE A GOOD IMPRESSION ON HIS HOSTS, COMING ACROSS AS
SMOOTHER AND MORE CONFIDENT THAN THREE YEARS AGO, BUT WAS

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
VISIBLY TIRED FOR MUCH OF HIS VISIT. END SUMMARY.
- THE GENERAL IMPACT OF THE VISIT
2. (C) READING THE EXCELLENT REPORTS FROM PARIS AND BONN
ABOUT PREMIER HUA'S VISITS TO FRANCE AND GERMANY, WE
HAVE THE CLEAR IMPRESSION THAT THE BRITISH STOP BY COMPARISON SHOWED A LESSENED INVESTMENT OF MENTAL ENERGY, A
RELAXATION OF TENSION AND, IN FACT, A NOTICEABLE SENSE OF
BEING ON AUTOMATIC PILOT. THE EXPECTATIONS HERE WERE
LOWER. ELEMENTS OF STRESS IN FRANCE AND GERMANY WERE
MISSING OR LESS IMPORTANT: APPREHENSION OVER SOVIET
REACTION, HOPES OF SIGNING BIG COMMERCIAL AGREEMENTS,
DOMESTIC POLITICAL MANEUVERING TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE
VISIT. NOT THAT THE BRITISH PROTOCOLAIRE RECEPTION
SUFFERED IN ANY WAY. THATCHER MET HIM AT THE AIRPORT.
THE QUEEN GAVE HIM LUNCH AT BUCKINGHAM PALACE AND CONDUCTED
A PERSONAL TOUR OF THE HOUSE. AS A CHINESE DIPLOMAT
POINTED OUT TO US GLEEFULLY, IT WAS MORE THAN BREZHNEV GOT.
BUT WHEN IT CAME TO DISCUSSIONS, THE EFFORT SLACKENED.
THATCHER, UP TO HER EARS IN THE RHODESIA CONFERENCE AND
DISTRACTED BY A FULL PARLIAMENTARY AND INTERNATIONAL SCHEDULE (SHE NIPPED OVER TO GERMANY FOR A DAY TRIP IN THE
MIDDLE OF HUA'S VISIT), SPENT ONLY SLIGHTLY MORE THAN TWO
HOURS IN TALKS WITH HUA COMPARED WITH SCHMIDT'S TEN.
MOREOVER, THE BRITISH HAD HEARD MUCH OF WHAT HUA HAD TO
SAY BOTH ON PREVIOUS OCCASIONS AND THROUGH REPORTS FROM
CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL
PAGE 03

LONDON 22352 01 OF 04 120825Z

PARIS AND BONN. FINALLY, HUA WAS TIRED AND ON HIS THIRD
TIME AROUND. AS A CONSEQUENCE, DISCUSSIONS ON INTERNATIONAL ISSUES SKIPPED CURSORILY OVER THE MANDATORY WORLDSTRATEGIC SURVEY TO CONCENTRATE ON SOUTHEAST ASIA, AN AREA
STILL OF DIRECT INTEREST TO BRITAIN. THATCHER'S STRONGEST
EFFORT WITH HUA WAS ON CONTROLLING THE CHINESE POPULATION
INJCR INTO HONG KONG. THE REST OF THE VISIT AND THE
MAJORITY OF HUA'S TIME WAS LEFT IN THE HANDS OF THE TRADE
PROMOTION EXPERTS AND OLD CORPORATE FRIENDS OF CHINA LIKE
ROLLS ROYCE.
- THE TALKS
3. (C) A FOREIGN OFFICE PARTICIPANT HAS GIVEN US A POINTBY-POINT READOUT OF THE HIGH LEVEL SESSIONS. THATCHER AND
HUA HAD TWO MEETINGS. THE FIRST ONE MONDAY, OCTOBER 29TH,
LASTED JUST SHORT OF TWO HOURS AND CONSISTED OF AN
INTERNATIONAL TOUR D'HORIZON. ANOTHER SESSION ON FRIDAY,
NOVEMBER 1ST, WAS DEVOTED TO BILATERAL QUESTIONS.
FOREIGN SECRETARY CARRINGTON MET BRIEFLY WITH FOREIGN
MINISTER HUANG HUA ON NOVEMBER 2.

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
4. (C) SINCE THE BRITISH, LIKE US, HAD HAD A FULL READOUT
FROM THE GERMANS ON HUA'S INTERNATIONAL PITCH, THATCHER
LED OFF BY SAYING THAT ON QUESTIONS OF EUROPEAN COMMUNITY
AND NATO, BRITAIN'S VIEWS COULD BE TAKEN AS SUBSTANTIALLY
IDENTICAL WITH THOSE OF FRANCE AND GERMANY. SHE THEREFORE
SUGGESTED THAT THEY GET RIGHT DOWN TO A DISCUSSION OF THE
EAST-WEST BALANCE AND SOVIET INTENTIONS, PARTICULARLY
WITH THE PROBLEMS OF INDOCHINA IN MIND. AT THIS POINT,
HUA TOOK OVER AND HELD FORTH THROUGH THE REMAINDER OF THE
SESSION. HE DESCRIBED SOVIET MOVES IN IRAN, AFGHANISTAN,
THE YEMENS, PAKISTAN AND ETHIOPIA ALONG LINES OUR FOREIGN
OFFICE CONTACT FOUND TOTALLY PREDICTABLE, COVERING THE

GROUND AS IN BONN 19728 BUT MUCH MORE SKETCHILY. AT ONE
POINT, THATCHER TRIED UNSUCCESSFULLY TO INTERRUPT TO HURRY
HIM ALONG. HUA POLITELY BUT FIRMLY CARRIED ON.
- SOUTHEAST ASIA
5. (C) IN HIS DISCUSSION OF VIETNAM/CAMBODIA PROBLEMS
HUA EXPANDED, STARTING OFF FROM A DIFFERENT ANGLE TO HIS
BONN TALKS. IN 1975, ACCORDING TO THE CHINESE PREMIER,
VIETNAM HAD HAD A CHOICE BETWEEN PEACEFUL RECONSTRUCTION
WITH HELP FROM CHINA ON THE ONE HAND AND A POLICY OF

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
EXPANSIONISM ON THE OTHER. IN OPTING FOR THE LATTER THE
VIETNAMESE HAD DELIVERED THEMSELVES INTO THE HANDS OF
THE SOVIET UNION. THE CHINESE &quot;COUNTERATTACK&quot; OF LAST
AUTUMN WAS MORE THAN A LOCAL QUARREL. IT WAS A DECISION
BY CHINA THAT WORLD PEACE AND STABILITY REQUIRED THAT
VIETNAM'S EXPANSIONIST AMBITIONS BE DEFLATED. CHINA HAD
CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL
PAGE 02

LONDON 22352 02 OF 04 120708Z

WEIGHED THE RISKS OF SOVIET REACTION BEFORE THE &quot;COUNTERATTACK&quot; BUT HAD DISCOUNTED THEM. VIETNAM HAD BEEN TAUGHT
A LESSON AND HUA THOUGHT THAT THAT WOULD BE A FACTOR IN
STAYING ITS HAND NEXT TIME AROUND. VIETNAM ALSO HAD
SERIOUS PROBLEMS WITH ITS ECONOMY AND THAT WAS ANOTHER
INHIBITING FACTOR.
6. (C) ON CAMBODIA HUA SAID THAT THE VIETNAMESE INVASION
HAD CONVERTED THE CAMBODIAN CIVIL WAR INTO A NATIONAL WAR.
THE POPULAR RESISTANCE TO VIETNAMESE AGGRESSION WOULD NOT
DIE OUT. HUA INSISTED ON A FULL VIETNAMESE WITHDRAWAL.
HE MENTIONED SIHANOUK AND HIS RECENT OFFER OF A MEDIATING
ROLE, BUT DID NOT GIVE THE IMPRESSION THAT HE TOOK IT OR
HIM PARTICULARLY SERIOUSLY.
7. (LOU) AN ADDITIONAL POINT ON SOUTHEAST ASIA ATTRACTED
SOME PUBLIC ATTENTION DURING THE VISIT. HUANG HUA STOOD
IN FOR THE PREMIER AT HIS SCHEDULED PRESS CONFERENCE AND
HAD THE FOLLOWING TO SAY ON AREA SECURITY: &quot;IF THE
VIETNAMESE CARRY OUT ACTS OF AGGRESSION AGAINST THAILAND
OR MALAYSIA WE SHALL STAND FIRMLY ON THE SIDE OF THE
VICTIM.&quot;
- THE EAST-WEST BALANCE AND THE SOVIET THREAT
8. (C) THE PRIVATE SESSION WITH THATCHER, DEVOTED AS IT
LARGELY WAS TO THE SOVIET CHALLENGE, NEVERTHELESS CONCLUDED WITH A SLIGHTLY UPBEAT WORD FROM HUA. HE TOLD THE
PRIME MINISTER THAT IT WAS RIGHT TO TAKE THE SOVIETS
SERIOUSLY BUT WRONG TO OVERESTIMATE THEIR STRENGTH, AS
RECENT EVENTS HAD RENDERED THE SOVIET UNION RELATIVELY
ISOLATED. HUA REFERRED SPECIFICALLY TO CHINA'S NORMALIZATION WITH JAPAN AND THE UNITED STATES. HE REMINDED HIS
CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL
PAGE 03

LONDON 22352 02 OF 04 120708Z

LISTENERS THAT OVERT SOVIET AGGRESSION WOULD NOW LEAD TO
WAR ON TWO FRONTS, NOT JUST ONE. BUT HE DID NOT SAY HE
THOUGHT IT BOUND TO HAPPEN.

9. (C) IN PUBLIC, HUA WAS TOUGHER OR, AS ONE LABOUR
COMMENTATOR PUT IT, NOT INSCRUTABLE ENOUGH. SPEAKING AT
A GUILDHALL BANQUET ON NOVEMBER 1, HE WARNED THE WEST
AGAINST REPEATING THE MISTAKES OF APPEASEMENT WHICH
&quot;EVENTUALLY PLUNGED THE WORLD INTO A HOLOCAUST&quot; DURING
THE SECOND WORLD WAR. HE PRAISED THATCHER: &quot;WE NOTE

WERE NO UNTOWARD INCIDENTS. THE BRITISH GOT ACROSS THE
MESSAGES THAT THEY WANTED TO. CONTACT WAS ESTABLISHED

MUCH OF WHAT HE SAW--ESPECIALLY THE NEW BRITISH HIGHSPEED TRAIN--SEEMS TO HAVE MADE A GOOD IMPRESSION. SOME
COMMENTATORS HAVE EXPRESSED DISAPPOINTMENT IN THAT NO
SPLASHY TRADE DEALS WERE CONCLUDED NOR ANY STRIKING NEW
MOVES ON THE INTERNATIONAL CHESSBOARD MADE. IN FACT,
THE VISIT CAUSED LITTLE REVERBERATION IN THE PRESS OR

ACHIEVED, QUICKLY TURNED ITS ATTENTION TO OTHER THINGS.

THE CHINESE &quot;COUNTERATTACK&quot;, WE DETECT SOME BETWEEN-THELINES EVIDENCE OF A NEW ATTITUDE TOWARD CHINA'S WORLD ROLE.
WHEN HUA SPOKE OF DEFLATING VIETNAMESE AMBITIONS, HE SPOKE
NOT MERELY AS THE CHINESE LEADER BUT AS SOMEONE WHO HAS
A STAKE IN THE WORLD ORDER AND PROPER INTERNATIONAL
BEHAVIOR. THE SAME ATTITUDE COMES THROUGH IN HUANG HUA'S
REMARKS ABOUT DEFENDING THAILAND AND MALAYSIA. FOR NOW,
CHINA'S &quot;BEAT&quot; SEEMS TO INCLUDE MOST OF SOUTHEAST ASIA.
- THE OPENING OF AIR SERVICES BETWEEN HONG KONG AND
CITIES IN CHINA IS A PRACTICAL STEP OF CONSIDERABLE
IMPORTANCE IN THE INTERPENETRATION OF CHINA AND SOUTHEAST
ASIA. IT COULD LEAD RAPIDLY TO SUBSTANTIAL INCREASES
IN TRAVEL, ESPECIALLY BY ETHNIC CHINESE. BREWSTER

IN MORE OVERT PUBLIC SOVIET-BASHING HERE THAN ON OTHER

MADE A GOOD IMPRESSION ON HIS HOSTS, COMING ACROSS AS
SMOOTHER AND MORE CONFIDENT THAN THREE YEARS AGO, BUT WAS

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
VISIBLY TIRED FOR MUCH OF HIS VISIT. END SUMMARY.
- THE GENERAL IMPACT OF THE VISIT
2. (C) READING THE EXCELLENT REPORTS FROM PARIS AND BONN
ABOUT PREMIER HUA'S VISITS TO FRANCE AND GERMANY, WE
HAVE THE CLEAR IMPRESSION THAT THE BRITISH STOP BY COMPARISON SHOWED A LESSENED INVESTMENT OF MENTAL ENERGY, A
RELAXATION OF TENSION AND, IN FACT, A NOTICEABLE SENSE OF
BEING ON AUTOMATIC PILOT. THE EXPECTATIONS HERE WERE
LOWER. ELEMENTS OF STRESS IN FRANCE AND GERMANY WERE
MISSING OR LESS IMPORTANT: APPREHENSION OVER SOVIET
REACTION, HOPES OF SIGNING BIG COMMERCIAL AGREEMENTS,
DOMESTIC POLITICAL MANEUVERING TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE
VISIT. NOT THAT THE BRITISH PROTOCOLAIRE RECEPTION
SUFFERED IN ANY WAY. THATCHER MET HIM AT THE AIRPORT.
THE QUEEN GAVE HIM LUNCH AT BUCKINGHAM PALACE AND CONDUCTED
A PERSONAL TOUR OF THE HOUSE. AS A CHINESE DIPLOMAT
POINTED OUT TO US GLEEFULLY, IT WAS MORE THAN BREZHNEV GOT.
BUT WHEN IT CAME TO DISCUSSIONS, THE EFFORT SLACKENED.
THATCHER, UP TO HER EARS IN THE RHODESIA CONFERENCE AND
DISTRACTED BY A FULL PARLIAMENTARY AND INTERNATIONAL SCHEDULE (SHE NIPPED OVER TO GERMANY FOR A DAY TRIP IN THE
MIDDLE OF HUA'S VISIT), SPENT ONLY SLIGHTLY MORE THAN TWO
HOURS IN TALKS WITH HUA COMPARED WITH SCHMIDT'S TEN.
MOREOVER, THE BRITISH HAD HEARD MUCH OF WHAT HUA HAD TO
SAY BOTH ON PREVIOUS OCCASIONS AND THROUGH REPORTS FROM
CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL
PAGE 03

LONDON 22352 01 OF 04 120825Z

PARIS AND BONN. FINALLY, HUA WAS TIRED AND ON HIS THIRD
TIME AROUND. AS A CONSEQUENCE, DISCUSSIONS ON INTERNATIONAL ISSUES SKIPPED CURSORILY OVER THE MANDATORY WORLDSTRATEGIC SURVEY TO CONCENTRATE ON SOUTHEAST ASIA, AN AREA
STILL OF DIRECT INTEREST TO BRITAIN. THATCHER'S STRONGEST
EFFORT WITH HUA WAS ON CONTROLLING THE CHINESE POPULATION
INJCR INTO HONG KONG. THE REST OF THE VISIT AND THE
MAJORITY OF HUA'S TIME WAS LEFT IN THE HANDS OF THE TRADE
PROMOTION EXPERTS AND OLD CORPORATE FRIENDS OF CHINA LIKE
ROLLS ROYCE.

3. (C) A FOREIGN OFFICE PARTICIPANT HAS GIVEN US A POINTBY-POINT READOUT OF THE HIGH LEVEL SESSIONS. THATCHER AND
HUA HAD TWO MEETINGS. THE FIRST ONE MONDAY, OCTOBER 29TH,
LASTED JUST SHORT OF TWO HOURS AND CONSISTED OF AN
INTERNATIONAL TOUR D'HORIZON. ANOTHER SESSION ON FRIDAY,
NOVEMBER 1ST, WAS DEVOTED TO BILATERAL QUESTIONS.
FOREIGN SECRETARY CARRINGTON MET BRIEFLY WITH FOREIGN
MINISTER HUANG HUA ON NOVEMBER 2.

FROM THE GERMANS ON HUA'S INTERNATIONAL PITCH, THATCHER
LED OFF BY SAYING THAT ON QUESTIONS OF EUROPEAN COMMUNITY
AND NATO, BRITAIN'S VIEWS COULD BE TAKEN AS SUBSTANTIALLY
IDENTICAL WITH THOSE OF FRANCE AND GERMANY. SHE THEREFORE
SUGGESTED THAT THEY GET RIGHT DOWN TO A DISCUSSION OF THE
EAST-WEST BALANCE AND SOVIET INTENTIONS, PARTICULARLY
WITH THE PROBLEMS OF INDOCHINA IN MIND. AT THIS POINT,
HUA TOOK OVER AND HELD FORTH THROUGH THE REMAINDER OF THE
SESSION. HE DESCRIBED SOVIET MOVES IN IRAN, AFGHANISTAN,

5. (C) IN HIS DISCUSSION OF VIETNAM/CAMBODIA PROBLEMS
HUA EXPANDED, STARTING OFF FROM A DIFFERENT ANGLE TO HIS
BONN TALKS. IN 1975, ACCORDING TO THE CHINESE PREMIER,
VIETNAM HAD HAD A CHOICE BETWEEN PEACEFUL RECONSTRUCTION
WITH HELP FROM CHINA ON THE ONE HAND AND A POLICY OF

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
EXPANSIONISM ON THE OTHER. IN OPTING FOR THE LATTER THE
VIETNAMESE HAD DELIVERED THEMSELVES INTO THE HANDS OF
THE SOVIET UNION. THE CHINESE &quot;COUNTERATTACK&quot; OF LAST
AUTUMN WAS MORE THAN A LOCAL QUARREL. IT WAS A DECISION
BY CHINA THAT WORLD PEACE AND STABILITY REQUIRED THAT
VIETNAM'S EXPANSIONIST AMBITIONS BE DEFLATED. CHINA HAD
CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL
PAGE 02

LONDON 22352 02 OF 04 120708Z

WEIGHED THE RISKS OF SOVIET REACTION BEFORE THE &quot;COUNTERATTACK&quot; BUT HAD DISCOUNTED THEM. VIETNAM HAD BEEN TAUGHT
A LESSON AND HUA THOUGHT THAT THAT WOULD BE A FACTOR IN
STAYING ITS HAND NEXT TIME AROUND. VIETNAM ALSO HAD
SERIOUS PROBLEMS WITH ITS ECONOMY AND THAT WAS ANOTHER
INHIBITING FACTOR.
6. (C) ON CAMBODIA HUA SAID THAT THE VIETNAMESE INVASION
HAD CONVERTED THE CAMBODIAN CIVIL WAR INTO A NATIONAL WAR.
THE POPULAR RESISTANCE TO VIETNAMESE AGGRESSION WOULD NOT
DIE OUT. HUA INSISTED ON A FULL VIETNAMESE WITHDRAWAL.
HE MENTIONED SIHANOUK AND HIS RECENT OFFER OF A MEDIATING
ROLE, BUT DID NOT GIVE THE IMPRESSION THAT HE TOOK IT OR
HIM PARTICULARLY SERIOUSLY.
7. (LOU) AN ADDITIONAL POINT ON SOUTHEAST ASIA ATTRACTED
SOME PUBLIC ATTENTION DURING THE VISIT. HUANG HUA STOOD
IN FOR THE PREMIER AT HIS SCHEDULED PRESS CONFERENCE AND
HAD THE FOLLOWING TO SAY ON AREA SECURITY: &quot;IF THE
VIETNAMESE CARRY OUT ACTS OF AGGRESSION AGAINST THAILAND
OR MALAYSIA WE SHALL STAND FIRMLY ON THE SIDE OF THE
VICTIM.&quot;
- THE EAST-WEST BALANCE AND THE SOVIET THREAT
8. (C) THE PRIVATE SESSION WITH THATCHER, DEVOTED AS IT
LARGELY WAS TO THE SOVIET CHALLENGE, NEVERTHELESS CONCLUDED WITH A SLIGHTLY UPBEAT WORD FROM HUA. HE TOLD THE
PRIME MINISTER THAT IT WAS RIGHT TO TAKE THE SOVIETS
SERIOUSLY BUT WRONG TO OVERESTIMATE THEIR STRENGTH, AS
RECENT EVENTS HAD RENDERED THE SOVIET UNION RELATIVELY
ISOLATED. HUA REFERRED SPECIFICALLY TO CHINA'S NORMALIZATION WITH JAPAN AND THE UNITED STATES. HE REMINDED HIS
CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL
PAGE 03

LONDON 22352 02 OF 04 120708Z

LISTENERS THAT OVERT SOVIET AGGRESSION WOULD NOW LEAD TO
WAR ON TWO FRONTS, NOT JUST ONE. BUT HE DID NOT SAY HE
THOUGHT IT BOUND TO HAPPEN.

9. (C) IN PUBLIC, HUA WAS TOUGHER OR, AS ONE LABOUR
COMMENTATOR PUT IT, NOT INSCRUTABLE ENOUGH. SPEAKING AT
A GUILDHALL BANQUET ON NOVEMBER 1, HE WARNED THE WEST
AGAINST REPEATING THE MISTAKES OF APPEASEMENT WHICH
&quot;EVENTUALLY PLUNGED THE WORLD INTO A HOLOCAUST&quot; DURING
THE SECOND WORLD WAR. HE PRAISED THATCHER: &quot;WE NOTE
THAT MANY FARSIGHTED BRITONS HAVE TAKEN A REALISTIC VIEW.
THEY HAVE IDENTIFIED THE MAIN SOURCE OF INTERNATIONAL
TENSION, AND THEY FAVOR EFFECTIVE MEASURES TO PRESERVE
PEACE AND SECURITY. WE THINK HIGHLY OF YOUR COUNTRY'S

AND WITH ONLY OCCASIONAL REFERENCE TO HIS SUBORDINATES.
HE SEEMED FULLY CONSCIOUS OF HIS ROLE AND STATURE AS
LEADER OF THE LARGEST NATION. HE MENTIONED DENG XIAOPING
SEVERAL TIMES IN PUBLIC AND PRIVATE IN AN UNSTRAINED WAY.
ON NO OCCASION DID HE APPEAR RO BE CAUGHT OFF BALANCE
OR UNABLE TO HANDLE HIMSELF. IT SHOULD BE NOTED, HOWEVER,
THAT HIS ONE SCHEDULED PRESS CONFERENCE DID NOT TAKE PLACE.
ON INDUSTRIAL VISITS HUA APPEARED WELL BRIEFED AND USED
A WIDE ENGINEERING VOCABULARY CORRECTLY AND EASILY.
HIS STYLE IN PUBLIC IS RELAXED, BUT RESTRAINED. THERE WAS
NO BACK-SLAPPING A LA DENG XIAOPING.
16. (C) HUA'S CONTACTS WITH THATCHER WERE AMICABLE AND
BUSINESSLIKE. WE GATHER NO GREAT SURGE OF SYMPATHY TOOK
PLACE. IN FACT, AT THE CHINESE RETURN BANQUET, HUA PAID
MORE ATTENTION TO OLD FRIEND TED HEATH THAN TO THE PRIME

MINISTER AND PEOPLE NOTICED IT. HUA SEEMS TO ENJOY
SUMMITRY. HIS CONVERSATION IS PEPPERED WITH &quot;AS I SAID
TO CHANCELLOR SCHMIDT&quot; AND &quot;PRESIDENT GISCARD AGREED WITH
ME THAT...&quot;. THAT HUA DOES NOT LACK SELF-CONFIDENCE IS
CLEAR FROM THE WAY HE DOMINATED THE PRIVATE DISCUSSIONS.
17. (C) A FOREIGN OFFICE FRIEND OFFERED HIS IMPRESSIONS
OF HUA TODAY COMPARED WITH MAY 1976 WHEN THEN FOREIGN
SECRETARY CROSLAND MET HIM IN PEKING. HUA'S APPEARANCE
IN THE INTERIM HAS IMPROVED MARKEDLY. HE HAS LOST WEIGHT
AND GOT A BETTER TAILOR. HIS HAIR, ONCE A GREYING STUBBLE,
IS NOW LONGER AND COMBED BACK IN A MAO-LIKE CUT. IT IS
ALSO DARKER THAN IT USED TO BE.
18. (LOU) WE HAVE MENTIONED ABOVE THAT HUA SHOWED EVIDENCE
OF FATIGUE. IN FACT, HE WAS NORMALLY DONE IN BY THE END
OF THE DAY. MEMBERS OF HIS PARTY COMPLAINED THAT THE

NORMAL AFTER LUNCH &quot;CATNAP&quot; WAS TOO OFTEN MISSED. A
CHINESE DIPLOMAT TOLD US THE PARTY THOUGHT TOO MANY
INTERESTS HAD COMPETED SUCCESSFULLY FOR A SHARE OF THE
PREMIER'S TIME. THEY THOUGHT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER
IF HUA HAD SEEN ONE OR TWO THINGS IN DEPTH RATHER THAN

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
MANY THINGS SUPERFICIALLY.
19. (LOU) JOURNALISTS WITH THE HUA PARTY HAVE SAID THE
FOOD WAS ROUTINELY APPALLING. HUA DID HIS BEST DESPITE
THE ADDED DISCOMFORT OF UNFAMILIARITY WITH KNIFE AND FORK.
THE CHINESE EMBASSY COOK TOOK BREAKFAST TO HIM IN
CLARIDGE'S HOTEL EACH MORNING, SO HE HAD AT LEAST ONE
EDIBLE MEAL PER DAY.
- COMMENT:
20. (C) THE HUA VISIT CAN BE COUNTED A SUCCESS. THERE
WERE NO UNTOWARD INCIDENTS. THE BRITISH GOT ACROSS THE
MESSAGES THAT THEY WANTED TO. CONTACT WAS ESTABLISHED
AND GREAT BRITAIN IS NOW ON THE CHAIRMAN'S PERSONAL MAP.
MUCH OF WHAT HE SAW--ESPECIALLY THE NEW BRITISH HIGHSPEED TRAIN--SEEMS TO HAVE MADE A GOOD IMPRESSION. SOME
COMMENTATORS HAVE EXPRESSED DISAPPOINTMENT IN THAT NO
SPLASHY TRADE DEALS WERE CONCLUDED NOR ANY STRIKING NEW
MOVES ON THE INTERNATIONAL CHESSBOARD MADE. IN FACT,
THE VISIT CAUSED LITTLE REVERBERATION IN THE PRESS OR
PUBLIC. THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT, CONTENT WITH WHAT IT
ACHIEVED, QUICKLY TURNED ITS ATTENTION TO OTHER THINGS.
21. (C) FROM THE ABOVE WE WOULD SIGNAL TWO THINGS AS
WORTHY OF SPECIAL ATTENTION.

PAGE 03

LONDON 22352 04 OF 04 120712Z

THE CHINESE &quot;COUNTERATTACK&quot;, WE DETECT SOME BETWEEN-THELINES EVIDENCE OF A NEW ATTITUDE TOWARD CHINA'S WORLD ROLE.
WHEN HUA SPOKE OF DEFLATING VIETNAMESE AMBITIONS, HE SPOKE
NOT MERELY AS THE CHINESE LEADER BUT AS SOMEONE WHO HAS
A STAKE IN THE WORLD ORDER AND PROPER INTERNATIONAL
BEHAVIOR. THE SAME ATTITUDE COMES THROUGH IN HUANG HUA'S
REMARKS ABOUT DEFENDING THAILAND AND MALAYSIA. FOR NOW,
CHINA'S &quot;BEAT&quot; SEEMS TO INCLUDE MOST OF SOUTHEAST ASIA.
- THE OPENING OF AIR SERVICES BETWEEN HONG KONG AND
CITIES IN CHINA IS A PRACTICAL STEP OF CONSIDERABLE
IMPORTANCE IN THE INTERPENETRATION OF CHINA AND SOUTHEAST
ASIA. IT COULD LEAD RAPIDLY TO SUBSTANTIAL INCREASES
IN TRAVEL, ESPECIALLY BY ETHNIC CHINESE. BREWSTER
