		<h3>Tor</h3>
		<p><a href="https://www.torproject.org">Tor</a> is an encrypted anonymising network that makes it harder to intercept internet communications, or see where communications are coming from or going to.</p>
		<p>In order to use the WikiLeaks public submission system as detailed above you can download the Tor Browser Bundle, which is a Firefox-like browser available for Windows, Mac OS X and GNU/Linux and pre-configured to connect using the anonymising system Tor.</p>
		<h4>Tails</h4>
		<p>If you are at high risk and you have the capacity to do so, you can also access the submission system through a secure operating system called <a href="https://tails.boum.org">Tails</a>. Tails is an operating system launched from a USB stick or a DVD that aim to leaves no traces when the computer is shut down after use and automatically routes your internet traffic through Tor. Tails will require you to have either a USB stick or a DVD at least 4GB big and a laptop or desktop computer.</p>

		<h3>Tips</h3>
		<p>Our submission system works hard to preserve your anonymity, but we recommend you also take some of your own precautions. Please review these basic guidelines. </p>
		<div>
			<h4>1. Contact us if you have specific problems</h4>
			<p>If you have a very large submission, or a submission with a complex format, or are a high-risk source, please <a href="#submit_help_contact">contact us</a>. In our experience it is always possible to find a custom solution for even the most seemingly difficult situations.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h4>2. What computer to use</h4>
			<p>If the computer you are uploading from could subsequently be audited in an investigation, consider using a computer that is not easily tied to you. Technical users can also use <a href="https://tails.boum.org">Tails</a> to help ensure you do not leave any records of your submission on the computer.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h4>3. Do not talk about your submission to others</h4>
			<p>If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in source protection – it is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This includes other media organisations.</p>
		</div>

	</div>
</div>

<div id="submit_help_after" class="submit_elem">

			</div>
		</div>

		<h3>After</h3>

		<div>
			<h4>1. Do not talk about your submission to others</h4>
			<p>If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in source protection – it is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This includes other media organisations.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h4>2. Act normal</h4>
			<p>If you are a high-risk source, avoid saying anything or doing anything after submitting which might promote suspicion. In particular, you should try to stick to your normal routine and behaviour.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h4>3. Remove traces of your submission</h4>
			<p>If you are a high-risk source and the computer you prepared your submission on, or uploaded it from, could subsequently be audited in an investigation, we recommend that you format and dispose of the computer hard drive and any other storage media you used.</p>
			<p>In particular, hard drives retain data after formatting which may be visible to a digital forensics team and flash media (USB sticks, memory cards and SSD drives) retain data even after a secure erasure. If you used flash media to store sensitive data, it is important to destroy the media.</p>
			<p>If you do this and are a high-risk source you should make sure there are no traces of the clean-up, since such traces themselves may draw suspicion.</p>
			<div>
				<h4>4. If you face legal action</h4>
				<p>If a legal action is brought against you as a result of your submission, there are organisations that may help you. The Courage Foundation is an international organisation dedicated to the protection of journalistic sources. You can find more details at <a href="https://www.couragefound.org">https://www.couragefound.org</a>.</p>

		<p>WikiLeaks publishes documents of political or historical importance that are censored or otherwise suppressed. We specialise in strategic global publishing and large archives.</p>
		<p>The following is the address of our secure site where you can anonymously upload your documents to WikiLeaks editors. You can only access this submissions system through Tor. (See our <a href="#submit_help_tor">Tor tab</a> for more information.) We also advise you to read our <a href="#submit_help_tips">tips for sources</a> before submitting.</p>

<br />
&gt; *Exploring the Naxalite Threat in India*<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; The Indian government issued a warning to railroad operators and users<br />
&gt; July 6 after a militant group declared a two day &quot;bandh&quot; (commonly<br />
&gt; translated to &quot;strike&quot;) in eastern India. Unlike strikes elsewhere in<br />
&gt; the world, where workers protest low wages or poor working conditions<br />
&gt; by refusing to work, &quot;bandhs&quot; in eastern India tend to involve much<br />
&gt; more violent tactics. Strikes declared by the militant arm of the<br />
&gt; Communist Party of India - Maoists,* *known collectively as<br />
&gt; =E2=80=9CNaxalites=E2=80=9D have in the past targeted freight trains and =<br />
trains<br />
&gt; carrying police forces through sabotage, many of which have killed<br />
&gt; dozens of people. Civilians are typically not targeted (militants tend<br />
&gt; to focus on police forces and commercial development instead) but<br />
&gt; plenty of civilians are still affected by the violence.<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; Because of the general perception that the naxalites always follow<br />
&gt; through on their threats, strike warnings are generally enough to<br />
&gt; dissuage people from using public transportation. Passengers don=E2=80=99=<br />
t see<br />
&gt; it as worth the risk, so they plan around the strike dates, and<br />
&gt; operators are the same. It=E2=80=99s a tactic that, symbolically, shows j=<br />
ust<br />
&gt; how powerful Naxalites have become in eastern India, and demonstrates<br />
&gt; their real ability to affect commercial activity in the region.<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; The July 6 strike comes as a retaliation for a Central Reserve Police<br />
&gt; Force (CRPF =E2=80=93 India=E2=80=99s federal police force) operation tha=<br />
t killed a<br />
&gt; senior leader, politbuereau member and spokesman of the Naxalites,<br />
&gt; *&lt;Cherukuri Rajkumar<br />
&gt; http://www.stratfor.com/analysis/20100702_brief_senior_naxalite_leader_ki=<br />
lled&gt;*<br />
&gt; (alias Azad) in Andhra Pradesh state July 2. The news was unexpected,<br />
&gt; as India has had little luck capturing or killing key Naxal leaders in<br />
&gt; the past. Azad=E2=80=99s absence is not expected to seriously hamper the<br />
&gt; Naxalites capability (they are a very large, well organized force that<br />
&gt; will be able to replace him) but it was bound to agitate a response<br />
&gt; from the Naxalites like the strike declared July 6.<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; It=E2=80=99s unclear exactly what precipitated the CRPF operation that ki=<br />
lled<br />
&gt; Azad, however it came after a busy spring in Naxalite territory. On<br />
&gt; April 6, Naxalites mounted a textbook armed ambush that *&lt;killed 76<br />
&gt; CRPF members conducting a patrol in Chhattisgarh state<br />
&gt; http://www.stratfor.com/analysis/20100406_india_naxalite_tactics_and_dead=<br />
ly_ambush&gt;*,<br />
&gt; the deadliest attack the Naxalites had carried out in their 43 year<br />
&gt; history. Then, on *&lt;May 17, militants detonated an explosive device<br />
&gt; along the road that targeted a bus<br />
&gt; http://www.stratfor.com/analysis/20100517_brief_death_toll_rises_indian_b=<br />
us_bombing&gt;*<br />
&gt; (again in Chhattisgarh state) that killed nearly 50 civilians and<br />
&gt; police. The spokesman for the group at the time, Azad, issued several<br />
&gt; statements to the press indicating that the group regretted the death<br />
&gt; of so many civilians, but blamed them for riding on the bus with<br />
&gt; police officers, something they had been warned against multiple<br />
&gt; times. Indeed, police in this region are typically not allowed to ride<br />
&gt; on public transportation due to the threat of Naxalite attacks and the<br />
&gt; possibility of collateral damage. Shortly thereafter, on May 28, *&lt;an<br />
&gt; act of sabotage against a railway line in West Bengal<br />
&gt; http://www.stratfor.com/analysis/20100528_brief_indian_train_derailment_d=<br />
eath_toll_hits_71&gt;<br />
&gt; *state caused a train carrying only civilians to derail. It was<br />
&gt; subsequently hit by a freight train, resulting in the death of nearly<br />
&gt; 150 people. While Naxalites initially denied that they were involved,<br />
&gt; they later admitted that a rogue gang trained by them had carried out<br />
&gt; the sabotage without permission from Naxalite central command.<br />
&gt; However, there is also the possibility that the Naxals were attempting<br />
&gt; to derail the freight train (a much more common target) but mistakenly<br />
&gt; targeted the wrong track.**<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; Finally, in the wake of these very deadly (if not all intentional)<br />
&gt; attacks, the Naxalites reiterated on June 24 their intention to drive<br />
&gt; out Multi National Corporations from India and that they would use<br />
&gt; violence to do so. This most recent rhetorical threat drives at the<br />
&gt; heart of the Naxals=E2=80=99 primary interest and, backed up with *&lt;a pro=<br />

&gt; tactical ability to strike economic targets<br />
&gt; http://www.stratfor.com/threat_against_multinationals_indias_high_tech_ce=<br />
nter<br />
&gt; &gt;*, *&lt;embodies the worst nightmare of the Indian government<br />
&gt; http://www.stratfor.com/india_escalating_naxalite_threat*&gt;. It is this<br />
&gt; current situation in India that causes us at STRATFOR to take a look<br />
&gt; at one of the worlds=E2=80=99 longest running insurgencies to see what ma=<br />
kes<br />
&gt; it tick.<br />
&gt;<br />
*BACKGROUND<br />
<br />
*<br />
<br />
The Naxalites get their name from their starting point =E2=80=93 the villag=<br />
e of<br />
Naxalbari in West Bengal state where, in May 1967, a local communist<br />
party leader promised to redistribute land to the peasants who worked,<br />
but did not own any of, the land. This was not the first time such a<br />
proclamation by a communist party member had been made before in eastern<br />
India =E2=80=93 many other attempts at fomenting a working class rebellion =<br />
had<br />
been started but faltered. This one, however, triggered a wave of<br />
violence in which workers killed and intimidated land owners, in many<br />
cases running them off their land and reclaiming it as their own. The<br />
actions were justified by a sentiment held amongst the working class<br />
(which was largely made up of tribal members) that they were merely<br />
taking back what they  had been forced to give up to wealthier<br />
businessmen from the west who had gained the land from the locals<br />
through debt schemes in which the newcomers took over possession of the<br />
tribals' land as collateral for outstanding debts the tribals owed them.<br />
Certainly neither side was innocent in all this, and animosity ran deep<br />
through both communities.<br />
<br />
However, on a grander, geopolitical level, the Naxalite issue can be<br />
looked at through the prism of the *&lt;Chinese-Indian rivalry<br />
http://www.stratfor.com/geopolitical_diary/20090309_geopolitical_diary_geop=<br />
olitics_tibet&gt;*<br />
. The Naxalites adopted the ideology of Mao Zedong, the Chinese<br />
revolutionary  and leader who converted China to communism and who had<br />
just begun the cultural revolution there in 1966. During the beginning<br />
of the Naxalite movement, there was much rhetorical support between the<br />
Maoist regime in China and the Naxalites in India. There is little<br />
evidence of material support then (and there is no indication of support<br />
today) but the advent and growth of the Naxalite movement certainly did<br />
serve China=E2=80=99s goals of weakening its largest neighbor to the south.<br />
<br />
Although India was able to slow down ** the Naxalite movement<br />
significantly in 1971 and reinstate the status quo ante, but the belief<br />
that the federal government in New Delhi had robbed tribal groups of<br />
their land in eastern India persisted. The Naxalite movement continued<br />
in a somewhat dormant phase, through the 1970s, 80s and early 1990s<br />
before violence resumed again in the late 1990s and has been escalating<br />
over the past ten yeas.<br />
<br />
The rise in violence corresponds with India=E2=80=99s economic growth. This=<br />
 is<br />
not coincidental. India has experienced a boom in economic growth over<br />
the past twenty years that saw its per capita income rise approximately<br />
100%. For comparison, it took India 40 years to complete its last<br />
doubling of per capita income. This growth has been sustained by foreign<br />
investors who have invested billions into India=E2=80=99s economy. However,<br />
economic growth in India has not trickled down, a political liability<br />
that the Naxalites have used as a key lever they have used to both<br />
revive their movements and challenge the more mainstream political<br />
parties in India.<br />
<br />
<br />
*GEOGRAPHY and DEVELOPMENT<br />
**&lt;&lt;INSERT MAP: Red Corridor&gt;&gt;<br />
<br />
*The state of India as a whole has a very dissperate geography that<br />
contains 1.1 billion inhabitants. The federal government in New Delhi<br />
faces a huge challenge in exerting its policies across such a large and,<br />
in many areas, difficult to reach, state. Because of this, the Naxalites<br />
are not the only militant movement in India, groups in northwest and<br />
northeast India also take advantage of the terrain they inhabit and<br />
their distance from New Delhi to challenge the government for control<br />
over the territory they inhabit. The Naxalites specifically inhabit an<br />
area known as the &quot;Red Corridor&quot; that stretches from Bihar state in<br />
India's northeast down to Karnatka state in the south. The states that<br />
currently and historically have seen the most violence are Chhattisgarh,<br />
West  Bengal and Orissa states. This region of India is rough terrain,<br />
defined by rolling hills covered in dense jungle that makes central<br />
control over the region extremely difficult to accomplish. Improved<br />
roads are few and far between, meaning that Naxalites can more easily<br />
control outside access. This geographic isolation has created a tribal<br />
mentalitiy within the area. So while the government lumps the militant<br />
movement in the area under the umbrella of &quot;Naxalism&quot;, the militant<br />
movement is actually quite diffuse, with small units acting with varying<br />
levels of autonomy throughout the region. There is little indication<br />
that, for example, a unit from Chattisgarh would also be able to conduct<br />
operations in West Bengal. Transportation is expensive and dangerous, so<br />
people tend to stay close to home and defend it fiercely. This makes it<br />
difficult for outsiders to gain influence in the area, as well.<br />
<br />
It also means that the area is extremely poor. And although the region<br />
holds vast raw materials within its hills and forrests, the state of<br />
India has been hard pressed to exploit those economic resources because<br />
they have been unable to effectively control them. While Naxals call for<br />
the improvement of the lives of the people they claim to represent, they<br />
certainly have shown no tolerance for letting the government attempt to<br />
increase economic development in the area. This is partly due to the<br />
fact that there is a very low level of trust between the Naxals and New<br />
Delhi. It raises the conundrum of how the government can possibly<br />
provide security without devleopment, and how development can possibly<br />
take place without security. An example of this can be seen in the<br />
Naxalites' constant sabotage of roads in the area by planting IEDs under<br />
the surface or simply digging it up, making them unusable. Roads are<br />
necessary for development, but, in the more immediate term, Naxals view<br />
roads as a means for the government to send its forces into their teritory.<br />
<br />
Eager to stimulate growth, the government promised foreign investors<br />
land  without communicating, much less negotiating compensation, with<br />
locals inhabiting that land.  This has led to disputes between the<br />
locals, the foreign companies and the government.  A famous example of<br />
an ongoing dispute is the *&lt;South Korean steel conglomerate, POSCO<br />
http://www.stratfor.com/analysis/india_poscos_steel_investment_challenge&gt;*,<br />
which is in the process of acquiring some 4,000 acres in Orissa state<br />
upon which it can build a $12 billion steel mill. The project has been<br />
delayed by protests and acts of violence by locals opposed to the<br />
project and police have been unable to secure the area to permit<br />
building. Compensation to locals for the land is only just now (some<br />
five years after the land was promised to POSCO) being negotiated.<br />
<br />
India=E2=80=99s economic success has meant that foreign investors (like POS=<br />
CO)<br />
are increasing their presence in India, which means that locals like the<br />
Naxalites are faced with both a threat and an opportunity. Outside<br />
business interests (whether they be wealthy farmers from central India<br />
or South Korea) in partnership with the government pose the greatest<br />
threat to the Naxalite movement. On the other hand, there is<br />
opportunity. Outside investment could potentially bring jobs and<br />
development to an area that is desperately poor. There are two ways for<br />
the Naxalites to capitalize on this opportunity. The first is to benefit<br />
from the jobs that will be brought in by working at these manufacturing<br />
sites. However, due to the long history of distrust between locals and<br />
outsiders, Naxalites are skeptical of letting the government control<br />
anything in their region. Successful economic development that brings<br />
steady employment would have a calming affect on the radicalized<br />
militants that the Naxals need to exert their influence. Movements like<br />
the Naxals have an array of motivations for why they do what they do,<br />
but self-preservation is always a very high priority.<br />
<br />
The other opportunity is to force the government or the foreign investor<br />
to pay the group direct compensation for their land. Naxalites can<br />
increase the amount that they can demand for the land by organizing a<br />
militant force that can allow or deny access to certain areas, sabotage<br />
commercial activity and mobilize locals to make up its cadres. This is<br />
essentially a protection racket practiced. This model has been<br />
implemented and followed successfully by other militant groups, most<br />
notably the *&lt;Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta<br />
http://www.stratfor.com/analysis/20090316_nigerias_mend_different_militant_=<br />
movement&gt;*<br />
(MEND), which manages to extract concessions from energy giants<br />
operation in  the oil rich, but dismally poor Niger delta in Nigera.<br />
 While maoist leaders in eastern India do make statements on how<br />
commercial projects in the area need to provide locals with jobs, it is<br />
clear that Naxalites are also strengthening their capability to pursue<br />
the second option, as well.<br />
<br />
*<br />
The Threat<br />
*<br />
Naxalites maintain the capability to construct and deploy improvised<br />
explosive devices (IED), conduct armed raids and maintain an extensive,<br />
agile and responsive intelligence network. As seen in the examples<br />
highlighted above, Naxal fighters have the ability to be opportunistic<br />
in their attacks. The April 6 raid on the soldiers in Dantewada and the<br />
May 17 bus attack were both actions that took advantage of opportunities<br />
to target and kill police forces. The April 6 raid was the culmination<br />
of  2-3 days of stalking the CRPF unit in the forrest and waiting for an<br />
opportune moment to strike. The May 17 bus attack was organized in a<br />
matter of hours, with spotters noticing the police on the bus and<br />
alerting other cadres who planted the device further down the road. This<br />
flexibility and autonomy amongst groups makes them a dangerous force to<br />
a slower moving, more deliberate (and predictable) central police force.<br />
<br />
New Delhi insists that, according to the constitution, the Naxalite<br />
issue is one of law and order and, thus, a responsibility for the states<br />
to address. New Delhi had deployed the CRPF, but has not gone so far to<br />
deploy the military, something that many Indian politicians have called<br />
for as the only solution to addressing the Naxalites. While military<br />
advisors have been sent in to train local and federal police forces,<br />
they have not engaged in any known anti-Naxalite operations.<br />
<br />
India has a bad memory of deploying their military to address domestic<br />
threats in the past, such as the Sikh threat posed in the 1980s in which<br />
the military response was criticized as being too heavy handed. The<br />
military action at the Golden Temple in Amritsar, which was codenamed<br />
Operation Blue Star,  also fanned the flames of Sikh militancy and<br />
sparked a series of serious Sikh reprisal attacks, that included the<br />
Assassination of Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi- who had ordered<br />
the operation.<br />
<br />
Also, the military insists that it is currently focused on fighting<br />
*&lt;Islamist and separatist forces in Jammu &amp; Kashmir<br />
http://www.stratfor.com/analysis/20100630_brief_indian_administered_kashmir=<br />
_violence_blamed_pakistani_militant_group&gt;*<br />
in northwest India along the disputed border with Pakistan and are<br />
dealing with multiple *&lt;ethno-speratist movements<br />
http://www.stratfor.com/analysis/20081030_india_explosions_assam&gt;* in<br />
the northeast region of India surrounded by China and Bangladesh While<br />
Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has labeled the Naxalite issue the<br />
biggest threat to the country=E2=80=99s internal security, incidents like t=<br />
he<br />
*&lt;2008 Mumbai attacks<br />
http://www.stratfor.com/analysis/20081127_india_update_mumbai &gt;* provide<br />
evidence to most Indians that Pakistan and the militants who hide there<br />
pose a greater, external threat.<br />
<br />
In the end, Naxalism is fairly contained. Despite threats and<br />
indications from *&lt;Naxals to conduct attacks against urban targets<br />
http://www.stratfor.com/sitrep/20100222_brief_naxalite_arrested_plans_attac=<br />
k_delhi<br />
&gt;, *the group has not yet demonstrated a capability to pose a serious<br />
militant threat outside of its jungle hideouts in the urban centers of<br />
eastern India. Though it is not beyond the realm of possibility for the<br />
group=E2=80=99s leaders and bomb makers to develop such a capability. It wi=<br />
ll be<br />
important to watch for indications that they are attempting to train<br />
their cadre in the skills required for urban terrorism (what we refer to<br />
as<br />
&lt;http://www.stratfor.com/weekly/20100526_failed_bombings_armed_jihadist_ass=<br />
aults&gt;*&lt;terrorist<br />
tradecraft<br />
http://www.stratfor.com/weekly/20100526_failed_bombings_armed_jihadist_assa=<br />
ults**&gt;*.).<br />
<br />
However, even if we do not see them expanding their target set and<br />
employing more terrorist type attacks, that does not mean that the<br />
ability for Naxalites to challenge the state will not materialize in<br />
other forms. The Naxalites have a very sophisticated organization that<br />
relies not only upon militant tactics, but also social unrest and<br />
political tactics to increase its power vis-=C3=A0-vis the central<br />
government. Naxalites have formed student groups in universities that<br />
are sympathetic to their cause, they have human rights groups and<br />
interest groups advocating in New Delhi and other regional capitals for<br />
local tribal inhabitants in rural eastern India. These groups do not<br />
necessarily use violence, but do stage protests and incidents of &quot;acting<br />
out&quot; to express their grievances against the state. This ability to<br />
pressure the central and local governments with hard, militant threats,<br />
while maintaining a subtle, steady pressure from social groups means<br />
that even if the government did decide to deploy the military to combat<br />
the Naxalites, it would face a well organized force that by  no means<br />
would be easy for the Indian military to defeat usuing conventional warfare.<br />

&gt;&gt; This was a doozy. Will have a graphic tomorrow laying out the=20=20<br />

&gt;&gt;<br />
&gt;&gt;<br />
&gt;&gt; Exploring the Naxalite Threat in India<br />
&gt;&gt;<br />
&gt;&gt; The Indian government issued a warning to railroad operators and?=20=20<br />
&gt;&gt; users July 6 after a militant group declared a two day strike in=20=20<br />
&gt;&gt; eastern India. Unlike strikes elsewhere in the country, where=20=20<br />
&gt;&gt; workers protest low wages or poor working conditions by refusing to=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt;&gt; work, strikes in eastern India carry much heavier consequences.=20=20<br />
&gt;&gt; Strikes declared by the maoist militant group(s?) known=20=20<br />
&gt;&gt; (collectively?) as =E2=80=9CNaxalites=E2=80=9D have in the past led to t=<br />
rain=20=20<br />
&gt;&gt; wrecks caused by sabotage, many of which have killed dozens of peopl=20<br />
&gt;&gt; e. Civilians are typically left out of it, militants tend to focus o=20<br />
&gt;&gt; n police forces instead, but plenty of civilians are still affected=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt;&gt; by the violence.<br />
&gt;&gt;<br />
&gt;&gt; Due to their historical follow through on the threats, the Naxalites=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt;&gt; are typically successful at virtually halting public transportation=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt;&gt; during these strikes. Passengers don=E2=80=99t see it as worth the risk,=<br />
 so=20=20<br />
&gt;&gt; they plan around the strike dates, and operators are the same. It=E2=80=<br />

&gt;&gt; become in eastern India, and demonstrates their real ability to affe=20<br />
&gt;&gt; ct commercial activity in the region.<br />
&gt;&gt;<br />
&gt;&gt; The strike comes as a retaliation for a Central Reserve Police Force=20=<br />

&gt;&gt;&gt;=20=20=20=20=20=20=20<br />

&gt;&gt; e along the road that targeted a bus http://www.stratfor.com/analysis/20=<br />
100517_brief_death_toll_rises_indian_bus_bombing=20<br />
&gt;&gt;=20=20=20=20=20<br />
&gt;&gt;&gt; (again in Chhattisgarh state) that killed nearly 50 civilians and=20=20<br />
&gt;&gt;&gt;=20=20=20=20=20=20=20<br />
&gt;&gt; police. The spokesman for the group at the time, Azad, issued severa=20<br />
&gt;&gt; l statements to the press indicating that the group regretted the de=20<br />
&gt;&gt; ath of so many civilians, but blamed them for riding on the bus with=20<br />
&gt;&gt;  police officers, something they had been warned against multiple ti=20<br />
&gt;&gt; mes. Indeed, police are typically not allowed to ride on public tran=20<br />
&gt;&gt; sportation due to the threat of Naxalite attacks and the possibility=20<br />
&gt;&gt;  of collateral damage. Shortly thereafter, on May 28, &lt;an act of sab=20<br />

&gt;&gt;&gt;=20=20=20=20=20=20=20<br />
&gt;&gt; sequently hit by a freight train, resulting in the death of nearly 1=20<br />
&gt;&gt; 50 people. While Naxalites initially denied that they were involved,=20<br />
&gt;&gt;  they later admitted that a rogue gang trained by them had carried o=20<br />
&gt;&gt; ut the sabotage without permission from Naxalite central command. (t=20<br />
&gt;&gt; hough this is likely merely an attempt to save face and it is believ=20<br />
&gt;&gt; ed that the Naxals were attempting to hit the freight train but deto=20<br />
&gt;&gt; nated their IED too early and hit the passenger train by accident).<br />
&gt;&gt;<br />
&gt;&gt; Finally, in the wake of these very effective (if not all=20=20<br />
&gt;&gt; intentional) attacks, the Naxalites reiterated on June 24 their=20=20<br />
&gt;&gt; intention to drive out Multi National Corporations from India and=20=20<br />

=20<br />
&gt;&gt;&gt;=20=20=20=20=20=20=20<br />
&gt;&gt; to take a look at one of the worlds=E2=80=99 longest running insurgencie=<br />

&gt;&gt;  see what makes it tick.<br />
&gt;&gt;<br />
&gt;&gt;<br />
&gt;&gt;<br />
&gt;&gt; BACKGROUND<br />
&gt;&gt;<br />
&gt;&gt; The Naxalites get their name from their starting point =E2=80=93 the vil=<br />
lage=20<br />
&gt;&gt;  of Naxalbari in West Bengal where, in May 1967, a local communist p=20<br />
&gt;&gt; arty leader promised to redistribute land to the peasants who worked=20<br />
&gt;&gt; , but did not own any of, the land. This was not the first time such=20<br />
&gt;&gt;  a proclamation by a communist party member had been made before in=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt;&gt; eastern India =E2=80=93 many other attempts at fomenting a working class=<br />
 reb=20<br />
&gt;&gt; ellion had been started but faltered. This one, however, triggered a=20<br />
&gt;&gt;  wave of violence in which workers killed and intimidated land owner=20<br />
&gt;&gt; s, in many cases running them off their land and reclaiming it as th=20<br />
&gt;&gt; eir own. The actions were justified by a sentiment held amongst the=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt;&gt; working class (which was largely made up of tribal members) that the=20<br />
&gt;&gt; y were merely taking back what they  had been forced to give up to w=20<br />
&gt;&gt; ealthier businessmen from the west who had gained the land from the=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt;&gt; locals through debt schemes. Certainly neither side was innocent in=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt;&gt; all this, and animosity ran deep through both communities.<br />
&gt;&gt;<br />
&gt;&gt; However, on a grander, geopolitical level, it is significant that=20=20<br />
&gt;&gt; this successful movement that began in Naxalbari. The Naxalites=20=20<br />
&gt;&gt; adopted the ideology of Mao Zedong, the Chinese ruler that had=20=20<br />
&gt;&gt; converted China to communism and who had just begun the cultural=20=20<br />
&gt;&gt; revolution there in 1966. During the beginning of the Naxalite=20=20<br />
&gt;&gt; movement, there was much rhetorical support between the Maoist=20=20<br />
&gt;&gt; regime in China and the Naxalites in India. India is China=E2=80=99s his=<br />
tori=20<br />
&gt;&gt; cal geopolitical rival, so fomenting unrest within the border of its=20<br />
&gt;&gt;  enemy would certainly be in China=E2=80=99s interest. There is little e=<br />
vide=20<br />
&gt;&gt; nce of material support then (and both sides deny connections now) b=20<br />
&gt;&gt; ut the advent and growth of the Naxalite movement certainly did serv=20<br />
&gt;&gt; e China=E2=80=99s goals of weakening its largest neighbor to the south.<br />
&gt;&gt;<br />
&gt;&gt; Although India was able to finally put down (they didn=E2=80=99t finally=<br />

&gt;&gt; the Naxalite movement in 1971 and reinstate the status quo ante, the=20<br />
&gt;&gt;  mentality (mentality or belief?) that the federal government in New=20<br />

&gt;&gt; hrough the 1970s, 80s and early 1990s before violence resumed again=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt;&gt; in the late 1990s and has been escalating over the past ten yeas.<br />
&gt;&gt;<br />
&gt;&gt; The rise in violence matches (has corresponded with has happened in=20=<br />

&gt;&gt; tandem with?) with India=E2=80=99s economic growth. This is not coincide=<br />

&gt;&gt; . As India has experienced a boom in economic growth over the past t=20<br />
&gt;&gt; wenty years that saw its per capita income rise approximately 100%.=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt;&gt; For comparison, it took India 40 years to complete its last doubling=20<br />
&gt;&gt;  of per capita income. This growth has been sustained by foreign inv=20<br />
&gt;&gt; estors who have invested billions into India=E2=80=99s economy. However,=<br />
 Ind=20<br />
&gt;&gt; ia has not managed to shepherd this economic growth without social c=20<br />
&gt;&gt; ost. Eastern India, where the Naxalites call home, has been targeted=20<br />
&gt;&gt;  by foreign investment for its large supply of natural resources, na=20<br />
&gt;&gt; mely iron ore and coal =E2=80=93 however the area is rich in many other =<br />

&gt;&gt; rals. Eager to stimulate growth, the government promised foreign inv=20<br />
&gt;&gt; estors land where they could set up operations without effectively n=20<br />
&gt;&gt; egotiating these concessions with locals. This has led to disputes b=20<br />
&gt;&gt; etween the locals, the foreign companies and the government.  A famo=20<br />
&gt;&gt; us example of an ongoing dispute is the &lt;South Korean steel conglome=20<br />
&gt;&gt; rate, POSCO http://www.stratfor.com/analysis/india_poscos_steel_investme=<br />

&gt;&gt; as been marred by protests and acts of violence by locals opposed to=20<br />
&gt;&gt;  the project and police have been unable to secure the area to permi=20<br />
&gt;&gt; t building. Compensation to locals for the land is only just now (so=20<br />
&gt;&gt; me five years after the land was promised to POSCO) being negotiated.<br />
&gt;&gt;<br />
&gt;&gt; Exploitation<br />
&gt;&gt;<br />
&gt;&gt; India=E2=80=99s economic success has meant that foreign investors (like =<br />
POSC=20<br />
&gt;&gt; O) are increasing their presence in India, which means that locals l=20<br />
&gt;&gt; ike the Naxalites are faced with both a threat and a possibility. Th=20<br />
&gt;&gt; e threat is that they could lose their land =E2=80=93 this time, not for=<br />
 agr=20<br />
&gt;&gt; icultural purposes, but for manufacturing purposes. Instead of wealt=20<br />
&gt;&gt; hy Indians from the center of the country, this time the outsiders a=20<br />
&gt;&gt; re foreign businessmen. If they don=E2=80=99t fight for their land, they=<br />
 may=20<br />
&gt;&gt;  well lose it to these outsiders. On the other hand, there is opport=20<br />
&gt;&gt; unity. Outside investment could potentially bring jobs and developme=20<br />
&gt;&gt; nt to an area that is desperately poor. There are two ways for the N=20<br />
&gt;&gt; axalites to capitalize on this opportunity. The first is to benefit=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt;&gt; from the jobs that will be brought in by working at these manufactur=20<br />
&gt;&gt; ing sites. However, due to the long history of distrust between loca=20<br />
&gt;&gt; ls and outsiders, Naxalites are skeptical of gaining worthwhile empl=20<br />
&gt;&gt; oyment at these sites =E2=80=93 they don=E2=80=99t want to become essent=<br />
ially=20=20<br />
&gt;&gt; indentured servants just because the local steel mill is the only op=20<br />
&gt;&gt; tion they have.<br />
&gt;&gt;<br />
&gt;&gt; The other opportunity is to force the government or the foreign=20=20<br />
&gt;&gt; investor to pay the group direct compensation for their land.=20=20<br />
&gt;&gt; Naxalites can increase the value of the land by organizing a=20=20<br />
&gt;&gt; militant force that can allow or deny access to certain areas,=20=20<br />
&gt;&gt; sabotage commercial activity and mobilize locals to make up its=20=20<br />
&gt;&gt; cadres. This model has been implemented and followed successfully by=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt;&gt; other militant groups, most notably the &lt;Movement for the=20=20<br />
&gt;&gt; Emancipation of the Niger Delta http://www.stratfor.com/analysis/2009031=<br />
6_nigerias_mend_different_militant_movement=20<br />

&gt;&gt;&gt; (MEND), which manages to extract concessions from energy giants=20=20<br />
&gt;&gt;&gt;=20=20=20=20=20=20=20<br />
&gt;&gt; operation in  the oil rich, but dismally poor Niger delta in=20=20<br />
&gt;&gt; Nigera.  While communist party leaders in eastern India do make=20=20<br />
&gt;&gt; statements on how commercial projects in the area need to provide=20=20<br />
&gt;&gt; locals with jobs, it is clear that Naxalites are also strengthening=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt;&gt; their capability to pursue the second option, as well.<br />
&gt;&gt;<br />
&gt;&gt; The Threat<br />
&gt;&gt;<br />
&gt;&gt; Naxalites maintain the capability to construct and deploy improvised=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt;&gt; explosive devices (IED), conduct armed raids and maintain an=20=20<br />
&gt;&gt; extensive and rapid reaction intelligence network. An example of the=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt;&gt; speed of their intelligence capabilities and its interconnectedness=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt;&gt; with militant units can be seen in the May 17 bus bombing in=20=20<br />
&gt;&gt; Chhatisgarh. Naxalites confirmed that police had boarded the bus,=20=20<br />
&gt;&gt; passed the information along and approximately 30 minutes later, a=20=20<br />
&gt;&gt; unit was able to deploy an IED along the road that the bus was known=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt;&gt; to travel. This kind of cooperation amongst the Naxalites is=20=20<br />
&gt;&gt; indicative of a very broad indigenous support network. These=20=20<br />
&gt;&gt; networks operate along spectrums of violence, from those who fully=20=20<br />
&gt;&gt; condone, promote violence and have tactical training (these are the=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt;&gt; hardcore militant fighters who build the bombs, deploy them and are=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt;&gt; skilled at small unit armed assaults) to those who are sympathetic,=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt;&gt; yet may not necessarily approve of violence, to those who are=20=20<br />
&gt;&gt; opposed, but are too afraid of the repercussions to attempt to=20=20<br />
&gt;&gt; oppose the Naxalites. This spectrum of support is indicative of an=20=20<br />
&gt;&gt; insurgency, however New Delhi does not see it that way.<br />
&gt;&gt;<br />
&gt;&gt; New Delhi insists that, according to the constitution, the Naxalite=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt;&gt; issue is one of law and order and, thus, a responsibility for the=20=20<br />
&gt;&gt; states to address. New Delhi had deployed the CRPF, but has not gone=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt;&gt; so far to deploy the military, something that many Indian=20=20<br />
&gt;&gt; politicians have called for as the only solution to addressing the=20=20<br />
&gt;&gt; Naxalites. While military advisors have been sent in to train local=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt;&gt; and federal police forces, they have not engaged in any known anti-=20<br />
&gt;&gt; Naxalite operations. Not even the air force has been granted the=20=20<br />
&gt;&gt; permission to support police forces with helicopters for deploying=20=20<br />
&gt;&gt; and extracting forces from the dense, hard to reach jungle areas=20=20<br />
&gt;&gt; where the only roads into and out of are heavily mined and monitored=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt;&gt; by Naxalites.<br />
&gt;&gt;<br />
&gt;&gt; The decision not to deploy the military is a complicated one, as=20=20<br />
&gt;&gt; India has a bad memory of deploying their military to address=20=20<br />
&gt;&gt; domestic threats in the past, such as the Sikh threat posed in the=20=20<br />
&gt;&gt; 1980s in which the military response was criticized as being too=20=20<br />
&gt;&gt; heavy handed. The military action at the Golden Temple in Amritsar,=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt;&gt; which was codenamed Operation Blue Star,  also fanned the flames of=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt;&gt; Sikh militancy and sparked a series of serious Sikh reprisal=20=20<br />
&gt;&gt; attacks, that included the Assassination of Indian Prime Minister=20=20<br />
&gt;&gt; Indira Gandhi- who had ordered the attack. Also, the military is=20=20<br />
&gt;&gt; currently focused on fighting Islamist and separatist forces in=20=20<br />
&gt;&gt; Jammu &amp; Kashmir in northwest India along the disputed border with=20=20<br />
&gt;&gt; Pakistan. While Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has labeled the=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt;&gt; Naxalite issue the biggest threat to the country=E2=80=99s internal secu=<br />
rity=20<br />

&gt;&gt;  &gt; provide evidence to most Indians that Pakistan and the militants=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt;&gt; who hide there pose a greater, external threat.<br />
&gt;&gt;<br />
&gt;&gt; In the end, Naxalism is fairly contained. Despite threats and=20=20<br />

i=20<br />
&gt;&gt;  &gt;, the group has not yet demonstrated a capability to pose a=20=20<br />
&gt;&gt; serious militant threat outside of its jungle hideouts in eastern=20=20<br />
&gt;&gt; India. Though it is not beyond the realm of possibility for the grou=20<br />
&gt;&gt; p=E2=80=99s leaders and bomb makers to develop such a capability. It wil=<br />
