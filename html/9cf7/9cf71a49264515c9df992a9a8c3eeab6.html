		<h3>Tor</h3>
		<p><a href="https://www.torproject.org">Tor</a> is an encrypted anonymising network that makes it harder to intercept internet communications, or see where communications are coming from or going to.</p>
		<p>In order to use the WikiLeaks public submission system as detailed above you can download the Tor Browser Bundle, which is a Firefox-like browser available for Windows, Mac OS X and GNU/Linux and pre-configured to connect using the anonymising system Tor.</p>
		<h4>Tails</h4>
		<p>If you are at high risk and you have the capacity to do so, you can also access the submission system through a secure operating system called <a href="https://tails.boum.org">Tails</a>. Tails is an operating system launched from a USB stick or a DVD that aim to leaves no traces when the computer is shut down after use and automatically routes your internet traffic through Tor. Tails will require you to have either a USB stick or a DVD at least 4GB big and a laptop or desktop computer.</p>

		<h3>Tips</h3>
		<p>Our submission system works hard to preserve your anonymity, but we recommend you also take some of your own precautions. Please review these basic guidelines. </p>
		<div>
			<h4>1. Contact us if you have specific problems</h4>
			<p>If you have a very large submission, or a submission with a complex format, or are a high-risk source, please <a href="#submit_help_contact">contact us</a>. In our experience it is always possible to find a custom solution for even the most seemingly difficult situations.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h4>2. What computer to use</h4>
			<p>If the computer you are uploading from could subsequently be audited in an investigation, consider using a computer that is not easily tied to you. Technical users can also use <a href="https://tails.boum.org">Tails</a> to help ensure you do not leave any records of your submission on the computer.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h4>3. Do not talk about your submission to others</h4>
			<p>If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in source protection – it is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This includes other media organisations.</p>
		</div>

	</div>

		<h3>After</h3>

		<div>
			<h4>1. Do not talk about your submission to others</h4>
			<p>If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in source protection – it is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This includes other media organisations.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h4>2. Act normal</h4>
			<p>If you are a high-risk source, avoid saying anything or doing anything after submitting which might promote suspicion. In particular, you should try to stick to your normal routine and behaviour.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h4>3. Remove traces of your submission</h4>
			<p>If you are a high-risk source and the computer you prepared your submission on, or uploaded it from, could subsequently be audited in an investigation, we recommend that you format and dispose of the computer hard drive and any other storage media you used.</p>
			<p>In particular, hard drives retain data after formatting which may be visible to a digital forensics team and flash media (USB sticks, memory cards and SSD drives) retain data even after a secure erasure. If you used flash media to store sensitive data, it is important to destroy the media.</p>
			<p>If you do this and are a high-risk source you should make sure there are no traces of the clean-up, since such traces themselves may draw suspicion.</p>
			<div>
				<h4>4. If you face legal action</h4>
				<p>If a legal action is brought against you as a result of your submission, there are organisations that may help you. The Courage Foundation is an international organisation dedicated to the protection of journalistic sources. You can find more details at <a href="https://www.couragefound.org">https://www.couragefound.org</a>.</p>

		<p>WikiLeaks publishes documents of political or historical importance that are censored or otherwise suppressed. We specialise in strategic global publishing and large archives.</p>
		<p>The following is the address of our secure site where you can anonymously upload your documents to WikiLeaks editors. You can only access this submissions system through Tor. (See our <a href="#submit_help_tor">Tor tab</a> for more information.) We also advise you to read our <a href="#submit_help_tips">tips for sources</a> before submitting.</p>

			<!--<div>
				Copy this address into your Tor browser. Advanced users, if they wish, can also add a further layer of encryption to their submission using <a href="#submit_wlkey">our public PGP key</a>.
			</div>-->
		</div>

		<p>If you cannot use Tor, or your submission is very large, or you have specific requirements, WikiLeaks provides several alternative methods. <a href="#submit_help_contact">Contact us</a> to discuss how to proceed.</p>

MOST PAPERS FRONT-PAGE CAMBODIAN SEIZURE OF US MERCHANT
SHIP EN ROUTE HK-THAILAND.  SEA-LAND SHIP &quot;MAYAGUEZ&quot;
FIRED UPON, TAKEN TO KOMPONG SOM.  WH REACTED SWIFTLY,
UNCLASSIFIED

PAGE 02  STATE  111694

ANGRILY TO SEIZURE (JOC).  PRES MET WITH NSC, CALLED
SEIZURE &quot;ACT OF PIRACY,&quot; WARNED OF SERIOUS CONSEQUENCES
(PHINQ).  WH SOURCES SAID DECISION MADE USE WHATEVER FORCE
NECESSARY TO GAIN RELEASE OF VESSEL.  NESSEN SAID DOS
INSTRUCTED DEMAND IMMEDIATE RELEASE OF SHIP.  WH SOURCES
SAID CAMBODIANS LAST WEEK CAPTURED PANAMANIAN VESSEL, AND
SHIP BELIEVED STILL IN KOMPONG SOM.  SEVERAL CONGRESSMAN
URGE IMMEDIATE ACTION TO OBTAIN RELEASE OF &quot;MAYAGUEZ&quot;
(BECKMAN, CHITRIB).

CUTTING LOOSE FROM CAMBODIA PROVING UNEXPECTEDLY DIFFICULT
FOR ADMIN.  US REPORTEDLY SENDING WARSHIPS TOWARD AREA
IN CASE EVENTUALLY NEEDED.  NEW CAMBODIAN REGIME HASN'T
EXPLAINED WHY GUNBOAT HALTED &quot;MAYAGUEZ.&quot;  WHAT CAN BE
DONE TO GET SHIP, CREW RELEASED REMAINS UNCLEAR, SINCE
MIL ACTION COULD PLACE 40-MAN CREW IN JEOPARDY.  WH SAYS

SHIP 60 MILES OFF COAST WHEN INCIDENT OCCURRED, BUT WAS
ONLY 8 MILES FROM SMALL ISLAND CLAIMED BY BOTH CAMBODIA,
VN (KEATLEY, WSJ).

SEA-LAND SPOKESMAN SAYS SHIP CARRIES COMBINATION OF MIL,
COMMERCIAL CARGO AND WAS ON REGULAR RUN.  DOS SAYS TAKING
IMMEDIATE STEPS OBTAIN RELEASE, BUT WOULD NOT BE &quot;HELPFUL&quot;
TO DISCUSS WHAT DOING.  CONGRESSMEN REACTED WITH SHOCK,
SOME BELLIGERANCE, THOUGH SOME ADVISE MODERATION.  INCIDENT
REMINISCENT OF &quot;PUEBLO&quot; AFFAIR.  US CONSIDERS TERRITORIAL
LIMIT 3 MILES, BUT CAMBODIA ONE OF ABOUT 40 NATIONS CLAIMING
12-MILE LIMIT (WIEGHART/CARTER, NYDN).  SUN CARRIES AP
LIST OF 39 CREWMEN; NYDN IDENTIFIES SHIP'S OFFICERS, DOES
BACKGROUNDER ON SEA-LAND.  NYDN'S GREENE OPINES SHIP
SEIZURE &quot;MAKES WAVES&quot; IN PRES' PLANS AT TIME WHEN TRYING
BEST PUT INDOCHINA WARS BEHIND HIM AND TURN FACE TO
EUROPE.  CSM'S SCHMIDT/SPERLING SEE US PLUNGED INTO MAJOR
CONFRONTATION.  BELIEVE INCIDENT SHOWS CAMBODIAN COMMUNISTS
THREATEN US FREEDOM OF SEAS IN AREAS; PRES DETERMINED MEET
FORCE WITH NO-NONSENSE ATTITUDE; AND CAMBODIANS POSSES
ENOUGH SEA POWER TO CAPTURE US SHIP.

USS &quot;CORAL SEA&quot; AND DESTROYERS DISPATCHED TO BACK
DIPLOMATIC EFFORTS RECOVER &quot;MAYAGUEZ.&quot;  THOUGH UNCONFIRMED,
UNCLASSIFIED

PAGE 03  STATE  111694

BELIEVED PRC ACTING AS DIPLOMATIC INTERMEDIARY.  ONE
PLAUSIBLE THEORY IS THAT CAMBODIA TRYING ENFORCE CLAIM
TO SMALL ISLAND NEAR LOCATION OF SEIZURE.  PANAMANIAN,
FIL MERCHANT SHIPS HAVE BEEN TEMPORARILY GRABBED BUT
LATER RELEASED IN PAST FEW DAYS IN SAME AREA (KUMPA, SUN).
DESPITE THREATENING LANGUAGE, US RELIES ON DIPLOMACY,
NOT MIL FORCE.  APPROACHES MADE TO CHINA TO USE INFLUENCE.
WIDESPREAD CONSENSUS IN DOS THAT IF MIL FORCE ATTEMPTED,
PRES WOULD HAVE TO GO TO CONGRESS FIRST TO GET PERMISSION
(MCCARTNEY, PHINQ).

APPEARS US MAKING DIPLOMATIC EFFORTS FREE SHIP, NOT
CONTEMPLATING IMMEDIATE MIL MEASURES.  SINCE CAMBODIA
CLAIMS 12-MILE TERRITORIAL WATERS, COULD RAISE QUESTION
OF WHETHER PRESENCE OF SHIP 8-MILES FROM TINY, DISPUTED
ISLAND WILL BE USED AS RATIONALE BY COMMUNIST GOVT; BUT
INTL LAW RECOGNIZES &quot;RIGHT OF INNOCENT PASSAGE&quot; UNDER
WHICH SHIP CAN PASS THROUGH TERRITORIAL WATERS.  SEA-LAND
OFFICIAL SAYS SHIP CARRIES MIL CARGO DESCRIBED AS PX
GOODS, COMMISSARY SUPPLIES, AND SPARE PARTS, BUT NO GUNS,
AMMO (GETLER/KILPATRICK, WP).  DOS QUICKLY ASKED PEKING,
THROUGH PRCLO IN WASHINGTON, TO HELP OBTAIN SHIP'S RELEASE.
FOLLOW-UP MESSAGES WILL BE SENT TO PEKING.  SOME SUPPORT
VOICED ON HILL FOR &quot;POLICE ACTION&quot; BY PRES (SHABECOFF,
NYT).  NATL MARITIME UNION APPEALED TO INTL SEAMEN'S

FEDERATION TO WORK FOR SHIP'S RELEASE (NYT).  SECSTATE
SAYS CAMBODIA'S FAILURE RELEASE US SHIP COULD HAVE SERIOUS
CONSEQUENCES (REUTER, ST LOUIS).  SINGAPORE'S LEE KWAN
YEW APPEARS CAUTION US AGAINST PRECIPITATE ACTION TO
RECOVER SHIP (REUTER, NY).  CAMBODIAN INCIDENT STALLS
NYSE RALLY (HILLERY, WSJ).

THREE OR 4 FRENCH NATIONALS REMAINED IN CAMBODIA. CAMBODIAN
COMMUNISTS THREATEN INCURSION UNLESS THAIS PULL BACK BORDER
LINE              ABOUT HALF-MILE, GIVE RTG WEEK TO ACT
(AFP, NYT).  SIHANOUK IN PEKING URGES ASIAN NATIONS
ABANDON &quot;PRO-IMPERIALIST&quot; STAND, JOIN THIRD WORLD,
ACCORDING JAPANESE LEGISLATOR (UPI, NYT).  CAMBODIA'S
NEW RULERS ADMIT GREAT DIFFICULTY, SAY PREPARED ACCEPT
FOREIGN AID, BUT WITHOUT STRINGS.  ABOUT-FACE SUGGESTS

EXTENT OF PROBLEMS CAREATED BY WAR AND CHAOS FOLLOWING
EVACUATION OF BIG TOWNS (REUTER, NYT).

PL ASSERTS CONTROL OF NON-COMMUNIST MIL FORCES IN LAOS,
RIGHT-WING COMMANDERS FALL INTO LINE.  PL ACCUSES
THAILAND OF SUPPORTING COUP TO OVERTHROW LEFTISTS, BUT
RTG DENIES ALLEGATION.  DOS SAYS NO PLANS EVACUATE 1000
AMCITS IN LAOS.  VIENTIANE AIRPORT AUTHORITIES HALT GROUPS
OF VIETS, CHINESE SEEKING TO LEAVE ALTHOUGH HAVE VALID
EXIT VISAS (CHITRIB).  ARMED FORCES SHIFT MEANSPL FACE
VIRTUALLY NO RESISTANCE AS MOVE TOWARD ESTABLISHING
FULL CONTROL IN LAOS (PHINQ).  SOUVANNA MAKES RADIO
APPEAL FOR CALM TO LAOTIANS AND FOREIGNERS WORRIED
BY POLITICAL DETERIORATION (UPI, NYDN).  RULING GENERALS
REPORTED FLEEING AS PL ORDERS PLANES GROUNDED.
AUSSIE EMBASSY BEGINS SENDING DEPENDENTS OUT (ANDELMAN,
NYT).  BOTH DOS AND WH OFFICIALS REACT CALMLY TO APPARENT
PL TAKEOVER, SAY HAVE NO PLANS EVACUATE AMERICANS.
ANALYSTS EXPECT LAOS FOLLOW PATH OF CAMBODIA, SVN,
BUT SOME SURPRISE AT SPEED OF PL MOVE TO PUSH RIGHTISTS
OUT OF COALITION.  SOUVANNA APPEARS ARRANGING SMOOTH
TRANSITION (SUN).  RECENT EVENTS DISCOURAGE PARENTS OF
CHARLES DEAN, BEING HELD BY PL SINCE DEC 14; FATHER
WILL CONFER AGAIN FRIDAY WITH AMB WHITEHOUSE (NYT).

IN REPEATED BROADCASTS SAIGON RADIO SAYS SOME STILL
RESIST REGIME, BUT NO DIRECT ACCOUNTS (NYT).  SERIES
OF PRG ANNOUNCEMENTS, INCLUDING CALL FOR 3-DAY HOLIDAY
THIS WK TO CELEBRATE COMMUNIST VICTORY, INDICATE
ORGANIZATION EXERTING MORE POLITICAL CONTROL IN SAIGON
(WP).  PRG, NOT MIL OR NVN, APPEARS IN CHARGE OF NEW
SAIGON GOVT.  DEVELOPMENT TEMPORARILY ENDED SPECULATION
NEW REGIME RUN BY VC MIL LEADERS OR NVN CIVILIANS

(PHINQ; UPI, NYDN).  &quot;PLAYBOY&quot; AND VC FLAGS SELLING WELL

SEEK URGENT CLARIFICATION OF NEW CAMBODIAN REGIME'S
SEIZURE OF UNARMED AMERICAN MERCHANT VESSEL, AND IT IS
IN THEIR OWN INTEREST TO DO SO (IN USIA WIRELESS FILE).

PEOPLE RATHER THAN STRATEGY, POLICY OR OFFICIAL LINE.
WP (MAY 11) FEELS HAD US NOT BROKEN OLD PATTERNS OF
CAMBODIAN SOCIETY BY INVADING COUNTRY IN 1970, LIKELY
THAT WAR WOULD NOT HAVE SPREAD TO CAMBODIA, AND LAND

WORKED FOR US AND COULD HAVE BEEN RESCUED, WERE LEFT

VIETS LEFT BEHIND BY US EVACUATION EFFORT, BUT SO WERE
SOME AMERICANS, &quot;OF WHOM NO ONE OFFICIALLY SPEAKS RIGHT
NOW.&quot;  SAYS AMB MARTIN IGNORED OR AVOIDED ORDERS HE
FOUND IMPOSSIBLE, AND ADM WHITMIRE BYPASSED WH AND DOD
ORDERS ON MORE THAN ONE OCCASION.  MARTIN BOTH PRAISED
AND DAMNED FOR PERMITTING SUCH LOOSE INTERPRETATION OF
MIL AND DOS REGULATIONS/DIRECTIVES THAT VIRTUALLY ANY
VIET COULD QUALIFY FOR REFUGEE STATUS.  AMID SO MUCH
CONFUSION, CHANCES OF DEEP CONGRESSIONAL PROBE DIMINISHED.

SEIZURE &quot;ACT OF PIRACY,&quot; WARNED OF SERIOUS CONSEQUENCES
(PHINQ).  WH SOURCES SAID DECISION MADE USE WHATEVER FORCE
NECESSARY TO GAIN RELEASE OF VESSEL.  NESSEN SAID DOS
INSTRUCTED DEMAND IMMEDIATE RELEASE OF SHIP.  WH SOURCES
SAID CAMBODIANS LAST WEEK CAPTURED PANAMANIAN VESSEL, AND
SHIP BELIEVED STILL IN KOMPONG SOM.  SEVERAL CONGRESSMAN
URGE IMMEDIATE ACTION TO OBTAIN RELEASE OF &quot;MAYAGUEZ&quot;
(BECKMAN, CHITRIB).

CUTTING LOOSE FROM CAMBODIA PROVING UNEXPECTEDLY DIFFICULT
FOR ADMIN.  US REPORTEDLY SENDING WARSHIPS TOWARD AREA
IN CASE EVENTUALLY NEEDED.  NEW CAMBODIAN REGIME HASN'T
EXPLAINED WHY GUNBOAT HALTED &quot;MAYAGUEZ.&quot;  WHAT CAN BE
DONE TO GET SHIP, CREW RELEASED REMAINS UNCLEAR, SINCE
MIL ACTION COULD PLACE 40-MAN CREW IN JEOPARDY.  WH SAYS

SHIP 60 MILES OFF COAST WHEN INCIDENT OCCURRED, BUT WAS
ONLY 8 MILES FROM SMALL ISLAND CLAIMED BY BOTH CAMBODIA,
VN (KEATLEY, WSJ).

SEA-LAND SPOKESMAN SAYS SHIP CARRIES COMBINATION OF MIL,
COMMERCIAL CARGO AND WAS ON REGULAR RUN.  DOS SAYS TAKING
IMMEDIATE STEPS OBTAIN RELEASE, BUT WOULD NOT BE &quot;HELPFUL&quot;
TO DISCUSS WHAT DOING.  CONGRESSMEN REACTED WITH SHOCK,
SOME BELLIGERANCE, THOUGH SOME ADVISE MODERATION.  INCIDENT
REMINISCENT OF &quot;PUEBLO&quot; AFFAIR.  US CONSIDERS TERRITORIAL
LIMIT 3 MILES, BUT CAMBODIA ONE OF ABOUT 40 NATIONS CLAIMING
12-MILE LIMIT (WIEGHART/CARTER, NYDN).  SUN CARRIES AP
LIST OF 39 CREWMEN; NYDN IDENTIFIES SHIP'S OFFICERS, DOES
BACKGROUNDER ON SEA-LAND.  NYDN'S GREENE OPINES SHIP
SEIZURE &quot;MAKES WAVES&quot; IN PRES' PLANS AT TIME WHEN TRYING
BEST PUT INDOCHINA WARS BEHIND HIM AND TURN FACE TO
EUROPE.  CSM'S SCHMIDT/SPERLING SEE US PLUNGED INTO MAJOR
CONFRONTATION.  BELIEVE INCIDENT SHOWS CAMBODIAN COMMUNISTS
THREATEN US FREEDOM OF SEAS IN AREAS; PRES DETERMINED MEET
FORCE WITH NO-NONSENSE ATTITUDE; AND CAMBODIANS POSSES
ENOUGH SEA POWER TO CAPTURE US SHIP.

BELIEVED PRC ACTING AS DIPLOMATIC INTERMEDIARY.  ONE
PLAUSIBLE THEORY IS THAT CAMBODIA TRYING ENFORCE CLAIM
TO SMALL ISLAND NEAR LOCATION OF SEIZURE.  PANAMANIAN,
FIL MERCHANT SHIPS HAVE BEEN TEMPORARILY GRABBED BUT
LATER RELEASED IN PAST FEW DAYS IN SAME AREA (KUMPA, SUN).
DESPITE THREATENING LANGUAGE, US RELIES ON DIPLOMACY,
NOT MIL FORCE.  APPROACHES MADE TO CHINA TO USE INFLUENCE.
WIDESPREAD CONSENSUS IN DOS THAT IF MIL FORCE ATTEMPTED,
PRES WOULD HAVE TO GO TO CONGRESS FIRST TO GET PERMISSION
(MCCARTNEY, PHINQ).

APPEARS US MAKING DIPLOMATIC EFFORTS FREE SHIP, NOT
CONTEMPLATING IMMEDIATE MIL MEASURES.  SINCE CAMBODIA
CLAIMS 12-MILE TERRITORIAL WATERS, COULD RAISE QUESTION
OF WHETHER PRESENCE OF SHIP 8-MILES FROM TINY, DISPUTED
ISLAND WILL BE USED AS RATIONALE BY COMMUNIST GOVT; BUT
INTL LAW RECOGNIZES &quot;RIGHT OF INNOCENT PASSAGE&quot; UNDER
WHICH SHIP CAN PASS THROUGH TERRITORIAL WATERS.  SEA-LAND
OFFICIAL SAYS SHIP CARRIES MIL CARGO DESCRIBED AS PX
GOODS, COMMISSARY SUPPLIES, AND SPARE PARTS, BUT NO GUNS,
AMMO (GETLER/KILPATRICK, WP).  DOS QUICKLY ASKED PEKING,
THROUGH PRCLO IN WASHINGTON, TO HELP OBTAIN SHIP'S RELEASE.
FOLLOW-UP MESSAGES WILL BE SENT TO PEKING.  SOME SUPPORT
VOICED ON HILL FOR &quot;POLICE ACTION&quot; BY PRES (SHABECOFF,
NYT).  NATL MARITIME UNION APPEALED TO INTL SEAMEN'S

FEDERATION TO WORK FOR SHIP'S RELEASE (NYT).  SECSTATE

CONSEQUENCES (REUTER, ST LOUIS).  SINGAPORE'S LEE KWAN

COMMENT AND ANALYSIS

7.  INDOCHINA

NYT SAYS PRC AND NVN ARE BEST-PLACED OUTSIDE POWERS TO
SEEK URGENT CLARIFICATION OF NEW CAMBODIAN REGIME'S
SEIZURE OF UNARMED AMERICAN MERCHANT VESSEL, AND IT IS
IN THEIR OWN INTEREST TO DO SO (IN USIA WIRELESS FILE).

NYT'S WICKER (MAY 11) SAYS SWEEPING DISPLACEMENT OF PEOPLE
IN CAMBODIA, WHILE NO BLOODBATH SEEMS AS BAD.

WSTAR (MAY 11) SAYS, ASSUMING GENOCIDE CAN BE INFLICTED
ON ONE'S OWN PEOPLE, THIS IS RIGHT WORD FOR FORCED EXODUS
OF CAMBODIANS FROM CITIES.  NOTES SCHANBERG'S CONFESSION
HE ERRED IN BELIEVING PP'S SUFFERING WOULD BE ENDED
UNDER COMMUNIST RULE, AND URGES US PEOPLE AND CONGRESS
TAKE HEED.  WSTAR'S MCGRORY (MAY 12), CITING SCHANBERG'S
REVELATIONS OF SAVAGERY WITH WHICH KHMER ROUGE IS SEALING
ITS VICTORY, PRAISES HIS CONTINUED DEVOTATION TO CAMBODIAN
PEOPLE RATHER THAN STRATEGY, POLICY OR OFFICIAL LINE.
WP (MAY 11) FEELS HAD US NOT BROKEN OLD PATTERNS OF
CAMBODIAN SOCIETY BY INVADING COUNTRY IN 1970, LIKELY
THAT WAR WOULD NOT HAVE SPREAD TO CAMBODIA, AND LAND

WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN WASTED, PEOPLE BRUTALIZED, AND
COMMUNISTS GIVEN OPENING THEY ARE SO HEARTLESSLY
EXPLOITING NOW (ALL IN USIA WIRELESS FILE).

AFP'S MANNOCK, IN PARIS (WP), SUGGESTS KEY TO WHAT MOTIVATES
UNCLASSIFIED

PAGE 11  STATE  111694

CAMBODIA'S NEW RULERS MAY LIE MORE IN COUNTRY'S HISTORY
THAN MARXIST THEORY.  RECALLS ABANDONMENT OF CAPITAL NOTHING
NEW, MAGIC PLAYS IMPORTANT ROLE IN CAMBODIAN LIFE TO
THIS DAY, XENOPHOBIA HAS DEEP HISTORIC ROOTS, NOR IS BLIND
OBEDIENCE DEMANDED BY KR LEADERSHIP NEW PHENOMENON (IN
USIA WIRELESS FILE).

DISPUTING &quot;JOY&quot; OF NATIONAL JOURNALS AND MEDIA OVER VN
OUTCOME, CHITRIB'S GREELEY MAINTAINS WHILE IT MEANT IMMENSE
HUMAN SUFFERING, TRAGEDY, IN TERMS OF US POWER VN WAS
&quot;TRIVIAL EVENT.&quot;

NYT'S SHIPLER (MAY 11) EXPECTS AID WILL FLOW TO NEW SVN
REGIME FROM PRC, SOVIET, OTHER COMMUNIST STATES.  NOTING
NEW GOVT SAYS IT MIGHT WELCOME US HELP THROUGH INTERNATIONAL
AGENCIES, HOLDS IF FORTHCOMING IT WOULD MARK BEGINNING
OF NEW CHAPTER IN US RELATIONS WITH INDOCHINA AT PEACE.
IN LETTER TO WP REPLYING TO &quot;HALF-TRUTHS&quot; OF CHILDS'
4/29 COLUMN, ADM MOORER SUGGESTS CONGRESS' &quot;HOBBLING&quot;
ADMIN MAY HAVE INSPIRED HANOI DRIVE AGAINST SVN; DENIES
HANOI EVER RAZED OR &quot;CARPET BOMBING&quot; PERFORMED; WITHOUT
US BOMBING, POWS WOULD STILL BE IN HANOI PRISONS; FACT
NIXON DIRECTED WAR'S AERIAL CONDUCT IS TRIBUTE TO
HIS COURAGE.  IN WP, FRANCES FITZGERALD (MAY 11) CONTENDS
PREDICTION OF SVN BLOODBATH WAS NEVER FOUNDED IN REALITY;
LOOKS FOR EARLY SVN COALITION GOVT OF OLD NLF LEADERSHIP,
PRG, MENTERS OF OLD FRONT ALLIANCE GROUPS AND THIRD
FORCE REPS.  (ALL IN USIA WIRELESS FILE).

SUN'S ISAACS (MAY 11), IN HK, SEES SURPRISING MODERATION OF
INITIAL PERIOD OF COMMUNIST RULE IN SVN LEAVING HOPE
THAT FUTURE MAY NOT BE DARK AS FEARED.

CDN'S TAMARKIN (MAY 8) QUOTES HIGH US DIPLOMATIC OFFICIAL
FROM SAIGON THAT US NEVER HAD EVACUATION POLICY FOR VIETS
WITH CLOSE US TIES, AND TIME RAN OUT BEFORE ONE FORMULATED.
SOURCE DEFENDS AMB MARTIN'S HANDLING OF EVACUATION,
NOTHING THAT WHILE FIRST MENTION VIET EVACUATION MADE BY
PRES IN MID-APRIL, AMEMBASSY SAIGON HAD BEEN IN MIDDLE
OF QUIET EVACUATION FOR MORE THAN MONTH.  CDN OF SAME
DATE CITES OTHER TAMARKIN, KEYES BEECH REPORTS AS BUTRESSING
UNCLASSIFIED

PAGE 12  STATE  111694

CRITICISM THAT MARTIN ACTED UNWISELY IN DELAYING EVACUATION.
INSISTS FIXING RESPONSIBILITY SHOULD NOT BE SIDETRACKED
BY FORD'S REAFFIRMATION CONFIDENCE IN MARTIN.
-

ANDERSON/WHITTEN (WP) CLAIM MARTIN NEVER LOST FAITH IN
THIEU &quot;UNTIL SAIGON BEGAN COLLAPSING AROUND HIS EARS,&quot;
AND BECAUSE OF AMB, TENS OF THOUSANDS VIETS WHO HAD
WORKED FOR US AND COULD HAVE BEEN RESCUED, WERE LEFT
BEHIND (IN USIA WIRELESS FILE).

LAT'S MCARTHUR (MAY 11) SAYS NOT ONLY WERE DESERVING
VIETS LEFT BEHIND BY US EVACUATION EFFORT, BUT SO WERE
SOME AMERICANS, &quot;OF WHOM NO ONE OFFICIALLY SPEAKS RIGHT
NOW.&quot;  SAYS AMB MARTIN IGNORED OR AVOIDED ORDERS HE
FOUND IMPOSSIBLE, AND ADM WHITMIRE BYPASSED WH AND DOD
ORDERS ON MORE THAN ONE OCCASION.  MARTIN BOTH PRAISED
AND DAMNED FOR PERMITTING SUCH LOOSE INTERPRETATION OF
MIL AND DOS REGULATIONS/DIRECTIVES THAT VIRTUALLY ANY
VIET COULD QUALIFY FOR REFUGEE STATUS.  AMID SO MUCH
CONFUSION, CHANCES OF DEEP CONGRESSIONAL PROBE DIMINISHED.

WSTAR'S NOYES (MAY 11) SEES ROTTENEST HELPING OF RECRIMINA-
TION BEING RESERVED FOR AMB MARTIN; SEES AS AMB'S REAL
SIN IN EYES OF MANY CRITICS HIS BELIEF IN HIS VN MISSION
(IN USIA WIRELESS FILE).

CHITRIB (MAY 13) SEES LAOS COALITION GOVT GOING WAY OF
EVERY SUCH REGIME IN WHICH COMMUNISTS HAVE PARTICIPATED --
IT HAS BECOME COMMUNIST GOVT.  WE'RE NOW BACK TO JFK'S
SCRIPT, WITH THAIS NEXT DOMINO IN LINE.  KISSINGER
