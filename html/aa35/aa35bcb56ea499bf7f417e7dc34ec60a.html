		<h3>Tor</h3>
		<p><a href="https://www.torproject.org">Tor</a> is an encrypted anonymising network that makes it harder to intercept internet communications, or see where communications are coming from or going to.</p>
		<p>In order to use the WikiLeaks public submission system as detailed above you can download the Tor Browser Bundle, which is a Firefox-like browser available for Windows, Mac OS X and GNU/Linux and pre-configured to connect using the anonymising system Tor.</p>
		<h4>Tails</h4>
		<p>If you are at high risk and you have the capacity to do so, you can also access the submission system through a secure operating system called <a href="https://tails.boum.org">Tails</a>. Tails is an operating system launched from a USB stick or a DVD that aim to leaves no traces when the computer is shut down after use and automatically routes your internet traffic through Tor. Tails will require you to have either a USB stick or a DVD at least 4GB big and a laptop or desktop computer.</p>

		<h3>Tips</h3>
		<p>Our submission system works hard to preserve your anonymity, but we recommend you also take some of your own precautions. Please review these basic guidelines. </p>
		<div>
			<h4>1. Contact us if you have specific problems</h4>
			<p>If you have a very large submission, or a submission with a complex format, or are a high-risk source, please <a href="#submit_help_contact">contact us</a>. In our experience it is always possible to find a custom solution for even the most seemingly difficult situations.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h4>2. What computer to use</h4>
			<p>If the computer you are uploading from could subsequently be audited in an investigation, consider using a computer that is not easily tied to you. Technical users can also use <a href="https://tails.boum.org">Tails</a> to help ensure you do not leave any records of your submission on the computer.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h4>3. Do not talk about your submission to others</h4>
			<p>If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in source protection – it is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This includes other media organisations.</p>
		</div>

	</div>

		<h3>After</h3>

		<div>
			<h4>1. Do not talk about your submission to others</h4>
			<p>If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in source protection – it is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This includes other media organisations.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h4>2. Act normal</h4>
			<p>If you are a high-risk source, avoid saying anything or doing anything after submitting which might promote suspicion. In particular, you should try to stick to your normal routine and behaviour.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h4>3. Remove traces of your submission</h4>
			<p>If you are a high-risk source and the computer you prepared your submission on, or uploaded it from, could subsequently be audited in an investigation, we recommend that you format and dispose of the computer hard drive and any other storage media you used.</p>
			<p>In particular, hard drives retain data after formatting which may be visible to a digital forensics team and flash media (USB sticks, memory cards and SSD drives) retain data even after a secure erasure. If you used flash media to store sensitive data, it is important to destroy the media.</p>
			<p>If you do this and are a high-risk source you should make sure there are no traces of the clean-up, since such traces themselves may draw suspicion.</p>
			<div>
				<h4>4. If you face legal action</h4>
				<p>If a legal action is brought against you as a result of your submission, there are organisations that may help you. The Courage Foundation is an international organisation dedicated to the protection of journalistic sources. You can find more details at <a href="https://www.couragefound.org">https://www.couragefound.org</a>.</p>

		<p>WikiLeaks publishes documents of political or historical importance that are censored or otherwise suppressed. We specialise in strategic global publishing and large archives.</p>
		<p>The following is the address of our secure site where you can anonymously upload your documents to WikiLeaks editors. You can only access this submissions system through Tor. (See our <a href="#submit_help_tor">Tor tab</a> for more information.) We also advise you to read our <a href="#submit_help_tips">tips for sources</a> before submitting.</p>

			<!--<div>
				Copy this address into your Tor browser. Advanced users, if they wish, can also add a further layer of encryption to their submission using <a href="#submit_wlkey">our public PGP key</a>.
			</div>-->
		</div>

		<p>If you cannot use Tor, or your submission is very large, or you have specific requirements, WikiLeaks provides several alternative methods. <a href="#submit_help_contact">Contact us</a> to discuss how to proceed.</p>

MONOLOGUE ON INDOCHINA IN WHICH HE STATED THAT IN A 1977
TREATY LAOS HAD CEDED TO VIETNAM THE LAOTIAN PORTION
OF THE HO CHI MINH TRAIL. END SUMMARY.
2. A FOURTEEN MEMBER DELEGATION OF US CIVIC AFFAIRS
LEADERS HEADED BY BROOKINGS PRESIDENT BRUCE MCLAURY

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
MET WITH PRC VICE PREMIER KENG PIAO FOR TWO HOURS THE
MORNING OF NOVEMBER 25. AMBASSADOR WOODCOCK AND A USLO
NOTETAKER ALSO ATTENDED, AS DID HSIEH LI, SECRETARY
GENERAL OF THE CHINESE PEOPLE'S INSTITUTE OF FOREIGN
AFFAIRS, AND MFA AMERICAN AND OCEANIAN AFFAIRS DEPUTY
DIRECTOR TANG WEN-SHENG.
3. KENG OPENED THE DISCUSSION WITH SOME REMARKS ABOUT
A YELLOW RIVER IRRIGATION PROJECT BASED ON SOVIET PLANS
WHICH HE SAID HAD GONE WRONG. IN THE FUTURE, CHINA MUST
PLAN MOERE CAREFULLY, RECOGNIZE AND LEARN FROM ITS OWN
BACKWARDNESS, &quot;SEEK TRUTH FROM FACTS&quot; AND LEARN FROM
THE GOOD POINTS OF FOREIGN COUNTRIES. WHEN THE CHINESE
PEOPLE BECOME RICH, THEN THE COUNTRY WILL BE STRONG.
BUT NOW, FOR INSTANCE, THE AVERAGE PER CAPITA PRODUCTION
OF FOOD GRAINS IN CHINA IS ONLY 300 KG PER YEAR, WHICH
IS NOT ENOUGH. AGRICULTURE IS THE FIRST OF THE FOUR
MODERNIZATIONS, BUT INDUSTRY MUST ALSO BE MODERIZED,
FOR OTHERWISE IT WILL BE IMPOSSIBLE TO MECHANIZE
AGRICULTURE.
4. IN RESPONSE TO A QUESTION BY JAMES THOMSON OF HARVARD
ABOUT CHINA'S CRITERIA FOR JUDGING SOCIALISM IN
FOREIGN COUNTRIES, KENG LAUNCHED INTO A LONG ATTACK
ON THE SOVIET UNION. IT USED TO BE A SOCIALIST
COUNTRY AND A GREAT NEIGHBOR OF CHINA, BUT LATER IT

PEKING 03849 01 OF 03 281230Z

CHANGES ITS POLICIES. IT OCCUPIED OTHER COUNTRIES
AND COMMITTED AGGRESSION. IT HAS NOT IMPROVED THE
LIVELIHOOD OF ITS OWN PEOPLE. IT SEEKS WORLD HEGEMONY,
WANTS TO SURPASS THE UNITED STATES, AND IN SOME AREAS
IS ALREADY AHEAD OF THE US.
5. CHINA USES THREE CRITERIA TO JUDGE WHETHER THE SOVIET
UNION IS A TRUE SOCIALIST COUNTRY OR IS SOCIAL
IMPERIALISM. ONE, WHETHER IT IMPLEMENTS SOCIALISM OR
FASCISM IN ITS DOMESTIC POLICIES. CHINA FEELS THAT
THE SOVIET UNION'S POLICIES ARE FASCIST. SECONDLY,
WHETHER IT PRACTICES SOCIAL IMPERIALISM OR INTERNATIONALISM IN ITS FOREIGN RELATIONS. IT SEEMS TO US THAT THE
SOVIET UNION DOES NOT PRACTICE INTERNATIONALISM, AS FOR
EXAMPLE IN ITS RELATIONS WITH THE COUNTRIES OF EASTERN
EUROPE, MONGOLIA AND CUBA. IT CONTROLS, EXPLOITS,
SUBVERTS AND OCCUPIES OTHER COUNTRIES. IT IS CONSTANTLY
TRYING TO EXPAND ITS TERRITORY, AND WANTS TO ANNEX PARTS
OF ITS NEIGHBORS' TERRITORY. AN EXAMPLE IS MONGOLIA,
WHICH HAS A LARGE TERRITORY AND A SMALL POPULATION. IT
HAS BEEN INDEPENDENT FOR 50 YEARS, BUT IS UNDER THE
COMPLETE CONTROL OF THE SOVIET UNION. MOSCOW HAS NEVER

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
HELPED IT, HAS NEVER PRACTICED INTERRNATIONALISM TOWARD
IT, SO THE PEOPLE THERE ARE STILL VERY POOR. TAKE ALSO
THE ORGANIZATION CALLED COMECON, AN ORGANIZATION
OF EXPLOITATION OF EASTERN EUROPE. THE COUNTRIES
THERE ARE SO EXPLOITED THAT THEY MUST LOOK TO THE WEST
FOR TRADE AND FOR ECONOMIC COOPERATION.
6. THE SOVIETS HAVE ALSO STATIONED TROOPS IN OTHER
COUNTRIES FOR LONG PERIODS OF TIME, CAUSING POPULAR
DISSATISFACTION. SOVIET TROOPS DIFFER FROM AMERICAN
TROOPS IN THAT THEIR PROVISIONS COME FROM THE OTHER
CUUNTRIES. IN HUNGARY THERE IS A POPULAR JOKE, IN
WHICH SEVERAL PEOPLE DISCUSS WHICH IS THE LARGEST
COUNTRY IN THE WORLD. ONE SAYS HUNGARY IS THE LARGEST.
CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL
PAGE 04

PEKING 03849 01 OF 03 281230Z

WHEN OTHERS ASK WHY, HE REPLIES THAT THE SOVIET TROOPS
IN HUNGARY WERE ORDERED TO WITHDRAW A LONG TIME AGO,
BUT THEY HAVE BEEN IN THE PROCESS OF WITHDRAWING FOR 20
OR 30 YEARS. SINCE THEY STILL HAVEN'T CROSSED THE
BORDER, HUNGARY MUST BE THE WORLD'S BIGGEST COUNTRY.
6. THE THIRD CRITERION FORSOCIALISM, KENG CONTINUE,
IS WHETHER THE SOVIET UNION REALLY HELPS NATIONAL
LIBERATION MOVEMENTS OR RATHER ACTS TO TURN NEWLY
LIBERATIED NATIONS INTO ITS OWN COLONIES. IN EGUYPT, FOR
EXAMPLE, MOSCOW SOLD THEM MAINLY ARMS AT A VERY HIGH
PRICE. WHEN EGYPT PROVED UNABLE TO REPAY THE DEBTS, THE
SOVIETS DEMANDED REPAYMENT IN SUCH GOODS A LONG-FIBER
COTTON. THEY ALSO USED THE SALE OF ARMS AS AN EXCUSE
TO SEND ADVISORS IN AN ATTEMPT TO CONTROL EGYPT'S ARMY.
IN THIS WAY RELATIONS BECAME WORSE. THE SAME THING
HAPPENED IN SOMALIA. WHEN THE SOMALIS WERE BUYING ARMS
FROM THE SOVIET UNION, MOSCOW CONSIDERED SOMALIA A
REVOLUTIONARY COUNTRY. BUT WHEN THE SOVIETS SET
CONDITIONS, THE SOMALIS REJECTED THEM, AND THE SOVIET

7. THE SAME HAS HAPPENED WITH RESPECT TO CHINA. IN
1956, MOSCOW ASKED THE PRC TO JOIN COMECON, BUT WE DID
NOT. WE SENT ONLY AN OBSERVER. THE SOVIETS PROPOSED
THAT CHINA DEVELOP ITS ONLY AGRICULTURE, IN ORDER TO
SUPPLY GRAIN TO THE SOVIET UNION AND EASTERN EUROPE.
IF CHINA NEEDED MACHINERY, THESE COUNTRIES WOULD SUPPLY
IT. THE SOVIETS HOPED CHINA WOULD REMAIN FOREVER A BACKWARD AGRICULTURAL COUNTRY, A SUPPLIER OF GRAIN. THIS
WAS UNACCEPTABLE TO CHINA. LATER THE SOVIET UNION
MADE OTHER UNACCEPTABLE DEMANDS. THE FACT THAT OUR

8. THESE ARE ONLY A FEW EXAMPLES. THE SOVIET UNION ACTTS
THIS WAY NOT ONLY IN ITS CRELATIONS WITH CHINA, BUT ALSO
WITH OTHER COUNTRIES. THUS THROUGH THESE THREE CRITERIA
WE CAN JUDGE SOVIET CONDUCT. AS FOR COUNTRIES LIKE
ROMANIA AND YUGOSLAVIA, THEY ARE DIFFERENT, SINCE THEY
PAY ATTENTION TO THEIR PEOPLE'S LIVELIHOOD AND HAVE NO
AGGRESSIVE INTENTIONS TOWARDS OTHERS.

WALKING, WE MUST TAKE FIRM STEPS, ONE AT A TIME, AND

10. PHILLIPS RUOPP OF THE CHARLES F. KETTERING FOUNDATION
REFERRED TO KENG'S RECENT AFRICAN TRIP AND ASKED ABOUT
CHINESE SUPPORT FOR ZIMBABWE LIBERATION MOVEMENTS AND
ABOUT THEIR ATTITUDE TOWARD THE ANGLO-AMERICAN PLAN FOR
RHODESIAN INDEPENDENCE. KENG REPLIED: WE SUPPORT THESE
PEOPLE'S ORGANIZATION. WE ALSO BELIEVE THEY RECOGNIZE
THAT WHILE WE SUPPORT OTHERS, OUR ABILITIES ARE LIMITED.
CHINA BELONGS TO THE THIRD WORLD AND IS A DEVELOPING
COUNTRY. OUR ASSISTANCE IS MEAGER, BUT THEY KNOW THAT
IT IS GIVEN WITH SINCERITY. IT IS TRUE THAT I RECENTLY
VISITED AFRICA, SEVEN COUNTRIES IN ALL. THE SOVIET
UNION SAYS WE ARE ENGAGED IN A MAJOR DIPLOMATIC
OFFENSIVE AGAINST THEM. THAT IS TRUE, IT IS DIRECTED
AGAINST THEM. BUT THERE ARE ALSO OTHER ASPECTS. FOR
OVER TEN YEARS, MANY THIRD WORLD LEADERS HAVE VISITED
CHINA, SOME OF THEM MORE THAN ONCE. VERY FEW CHINESE
LEADERS WENT ABROAD DURING THIS TIME. CHAIRMAN MAO WAS
OLD AND IN POOR HEALTH. PREMIER CHOU WAS ALSO OLD, AND
HAD TO COPE WITH THE PROBLEMS CAUSED BY LIN PIAO AND THE
GANG OF FOUR. OTHER VICE PREMIERS WERE TARGETS, AND SOME
WERE STRUCK DOWN BY THE GANG. NOW WITH THE FALL OF THE
GANG OF FOUR WE CAN SEND OUR LEADERS ABROAD ONCE AGAIN.
IN TERMS OF DIPLOMATIC RECIPROCITY WE OWE OTHER COUNTRIES
MANY DEBTS. IT IS TIME TO REPAY THESE DEBTS. FIRST OF
ALL, WE WANT TO PAY THE DEBTS, AND SECONDLY WE WISH TO
INCREASE UNDERSTANDING WITH OTHER COUNTRIES, STRENGTHEN
OUR FRIENDSHIP, AND BUILD UP OUR BILATERAL RELATIONS.

11. HOWARD SQUADRON, PRESIDENT OF THE AMERICAN JEWISH
CONGRESS, REFERRED TO HIS RECENT CONTACTS WITH AMERICAN
AND ISRAEL LEADERS ON THE SUBJECT OF THE MIDDLE EAST
PEACE NEGOTIATIONS AND ASKED WHETHER THE PRC WOULD
CONSIDER ESTABLISHING DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS WITH ISRAEL
IN THE EVENT A PEACE TREATY IS SIGNED. KENG REPLIED:
THER AE TWO PEOPLES IN THE WORLD WHO LOVE THEIR
COUNTRIES THE MOST, THE JEWISH PEOPLE AND THE CHINESE.
I AM QUOTING VICE PREMIER TENG HSIAO-PING. WITH RESPECT
TO THE MIDDLE EAST, WE HOPE FOR PEACE. IT IS ALWAYS
GOOD TO HAVE NO WAR. BUT ISRAEL HAS OCCUPIED TOO MANY
PLACES BELONGING TO OTHERS, AND OFFENDED TOO MANY
PEOPLE. IF THERE CAN WITHDRAW FROM THESE PLACES, IF NOT
COMPLETELY, THEN FROM MOST OF THEM, WON'T PEACE BE
REALIZED? SO MANY ARAB COUNTRIES OPPOSE ISRAEL; MANY OF
THEM BECAUSE THEY HAVE HAD THEIR TERRITORY OCCUPIED BY
ISRAEL. IF ISRAEL CAN SOLVE ITS PROBLEMS WITH SADAT
AND WITH THE PALESTINIANS, RESOLVING THE QUESTION OF A
HOMELAND, THEN THERE WILL BE GREAT PROSPECTS FOR PEACE
IN THE MIDDLE EAST.
12. NOW THE SOVIET UNION HAS ORGANIZED A REJECTIONIST
FRONT, AND WANTS TO EXPAND IT. WE HAVE MADE NO PUBLIC
DOCUMENT IN THE NEWSPAPERS ON THIS QUESTION. BECAUSE
THE ACCORDS REACHED AT CAMP DAVID HAVE NOT YET BEEN
IMPLEMENTED, WE DON'T KNOW WHAT WILL HAPPEN IN THE FUTURE.
EVERYONE IS NOW WATCHING HOW THE AGREEMENTS WILL BE
IMPLEMENTED. WE HOPE THAT PEACE CAN BE ACHIEVED, BUT IT
IS NOT GOING TO BE EASY. IT REQUIRES REDOUBLED EFFORTS.
IF YOU WANT ME TO SAY MORE, I CAN ONLY SAY THAT CHINA
IS IN NO POSITION TO HELP. WE HOPE THE UNITED STATES
WILL STEP UP ITS EFFORTS. IT IS JUST LIKE A TUG-OFCONFIDENTIAL

ESPECIALLY WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF THE UNITED NATIONS.

US AND THE SOVIET UNION. YOU HOLD NEGOTIATIONS ON
BANNING THIS OR THAT TYPE OF WEAPON OR ON SOME TYPE OF
LIMITATIONS, ACTUALLY THOSE WEAPONS KEEP ON
DEVELOPING.
14. MCLAUREY ASKED ABOUT THE POSSIBLE CONFLICT BETWEEN
CHINESE APPROVAL OF NATO AND THE COMMON MARKET AND ITS
RELATIONS WITH COMMUNIST PARTIES IN ITALY, FRANCE AND
SPAIN. KENG REPLIED: WE HAVE NOT PUBLICLY APPROVED
NATO, ONLY THE COMMON MARKET. THE COMMON MARKET IS
AN ECONOMIC ORGANIZATION DESIGNED FOR ECONOMIC EXCHANGES
AND TRADE, AND IT IS NOT BAD. WE HAVE SENT AN AMBASSADOR
TO THE EC. THE SOVIETS, HOWEVER, OPPOSE IT. THEY WANT
TO PUT EASTERN EUROPE UNDER THEIR COMPLETE CONTROL, SO
THAT ONLY THE SOVIET UNION CAN HAVE CONTACT WITH THE
EC. THE EASTERN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES DO NOT APPROVE
THIS POLICY.
15. AS FOR EUROCOMMUNISM, THE COMMON MARKET IS NOT THE
PROBLEM. WE HAVE LONG-STANDING CONTRADICTIONS WITH
EUROCOMMUNISM. THEY ORIGINALLY FOLLOWED THE SOVIET
UNION IN DENOUNCING CHINA, SO THEY ARE IN DEBT TO US.

COUNTRY; FRANCE COMMITTED AGGRESSION AGAINST IT. THE
UNITED STATES WAS AT WAR WITH VIETNAM FOR MANY YEARS,
AND CHINA SUPPORTED VIETNAM. WE GAVE THEM A GREAT DEAL
OF ASSISTANCE, WORTH MORE THAN $20 BILLION. BUT AFTER
THEIR VICTORY, THEIR AMBITION GREW GREATER AND GREATER.
DURING HO CHI MINH'S LIFETIME THIS AMBITION ALREADY
EXISTED, BUT IT HAS BECOME MORE OBVIOUS NOW. VIETNAM
WANTS TO SET UP AN INDOCHINA FEDERATION AND ANNEX LAOS
AND CAMBODIA. CHINA DOES NOT SUPPORT THIS AMBITION,
BUT THE SOVIET UNION DOES. ALTHOUGH WE GAVE VIETNAM A

18. LAOS HAS ALREADY BEEN VIRTUALLY ANNEXED. VIETNAM
SENT FIVE DIVISIONS THERE AND HAS STATIONED THEM THERE
FOR OVER TEN YEARS.THEY HAVE ALSO SENT MANY ADVISORY
GROUPS WHICH ARE EVERYWHERE FROM THE CENTRAL GOVERNMENT
TO THE GRASS ROOTS. WHEN THE UNITED STATES WAS INVOLVED
IN THE WAR, EVERYONE KNOWS HOW DIFFICULT IT WAS FOR
VIETNAM TO TRANSPORT THINGS TO THE SOUTH. SO THEY SET
UP THE HO CHI MINH TRAIL FROM LAOS IN THE NORTH TO
CAMBODIA IN THE SOUTH. LAST YEAR LAOS AND VIETNAM
SIGNED A NEW BOUNDARY TREATY, ACCORDING TO WHICH THE
LAOTIAN PART OF THE HO CHI MINH TRAIL IS NOW INCLUDED
IN VIETNAM'S TERRITORY. BUT THE SOUTHERN PART IS IN
CAMBODIA, AND WHEN VIETNAM RAISED THE SAME DEMAND, THE
CAMBODIANS REFUSED. THERE ARE ALSO TWO OTHER AREAS

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
BELONGING TO CAMBODIA, THE PARROT'S BEAK AND THE
FISHHOOOK. DURING THE WAR, VIETNAMESE GUERRILLAS TRIED
TO BORROW THESE AREAS AS REAR BASES, AND SIHANOUK
PROMISED THEM TO THEM. BUT AFTER THE VICTORY, WHEN
VIETNAM DEMANDED THE FULL INCORPORATION OF THESE TWO
AREAS, CAMBODI REFUSED. VIETNAM ALSO DEMANDED THAT
CAMBODIA JOIN AN INDOCHINA FEDERATION, AND CAMBODIA
REFUSED THAT. THEN VIETNAM SENT ITS TROOPS TO ATTACK
CAMBODIA AND PENETRATED UP TO 30 KILOMETERS. THEY SENT
SIX DIVISIONS TO ATTACK, BUT THEY WERE DEFEATED BY THE
CAMBODIANS. AT THE SAME TIME, VIETNAM ENGAGED IN SUBVERSION. THEY ATTEMPTED TO ORGANIZE A NEW GOVERNMENT IN
ORDER TO OVERTHROW THE PRESENT ONE.
19. VIETNAM SAYS THAT CAMBODIA ATTACKED THEM, THAT
CAMBODIA IS THE AGGRESSORS. I DON'T KNOW WHETHER YOU
BELIEVE IT OR NOT, BUT OTHERS DON'T. VIETNAM HAS 50
MILLION PEOPLE, WHILE CAMBODIA'S POPULATION IS 7 MILLION.

PEKING 03849 03 OF 03 271125Z

THE WAR, OVER 600,000 AND STILL EXPANDING. CAMBODIA HAS
ONLY ONE-SIXTH OF THIS. HOW COULD CAMBODIA ATTACK
VIETNAM? IT IS IMPOSSIBLE.
20. SOME PEOPLE ARE WORRIED
THAT VIETNAM MAY BE ABLE TO OCCUPY CAMBODIA. I AM AN
OPTIMIST, AND I DON'T BELIEVE IT. EVEN IF THEY OCCUPY
PHNOM PENH, VIETNAM CANNOT TAKE OVER ALL OF CAMBOIDA.
THE STRENGTH OF CAMBODI LIES NOT IN THE CITIES, BUT
IN THE COUNTRYSIDE.
21. WHY HAS THE SOVIET UNION SUCH A GREAT INTEREST
IN VIETNAM? IT IS MAINLY IN THE USE OF HARBORS, NAVAL
AND AIR BASES BUILT BY THE UNITED STATES. EVEN AFTER
ITS VICTORY, VIETNAM STILL MAINTAINS A LARGE ARMED
FORCE. FIFTY MILLION PEOPLE MUST FEED THIS FORCE, AND
THEY CANNOT DO IT BY RELYING ON THEIR OWN EFFORTS. THE
US THREW IN THE SPONGE IN VIETNAM BECAUSE NIXON WANTED
TO SHIFT HIS STRATEGIC FOCUS TO EUROPE. BUT THE VIETNAMES THOUGHT THEY HAD SUCCEEDED IN DRIVING AWAY THE
US TROOPS WITH MILITARY STRENGTH. AFTER THE WAR,
VIETNAM FAILED TO DEVELOP ITS PRODUCTION. THEY SHOULD
AT LEAST HEAL THEWOUNDS OF WAR, REHABILITATE PRODUCTIVE
FACILITIES, AND SOLVE THE FOOD PROBLEM, BUT THEY HAVE
BEEN UNABLE TO DO SO. THEY FAILED TO UNITE THE PEOPLE
OF VARIOUS STRATA. FOR INSTANCE, THEY CAST AWAY MANY
BUDDHIST MONKS WHO HAD SUPPORTED THEM. THEY CONFISCATED
THE PROPERTY OF FACTORIES AND SMALL SHOPS. THIS IS A
POLICY OF PLUNDER, NOT OF DEVELOPMENT. THEY CONFISCATED
ALL THE VALUABLES OWNED BY FAMILIES, SO MANY PEOPLE BECAME

CONTROL THE PEOPLE THROUGH SUCH ORGANIZATIONS. BUT
CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL
PAGE 04

PEKING 03849 03 OF 03 271125Z

THIS IS NOT RELIABLE. IT WILL ONLY CAUSE AVERSION
AMONG THE PEOPLE.
23. SINCE ITS VICTORY, VIETNAM HAS FAILED TO ESTABLISH
GOOD RELATIONS WITH ITS NEIGHBORS. IT LAYS TERRITORIAL
CLAIMS ON NEIGHBORING COUNTRIES. IT OCCUPIED THE
SPRATLY ISLANDS, WHICH ARE CHINESE TERRITORY, AND HAS
PROVOKED MANY BORDER INCIDENTS. IT FOLLOWS SOVIET
POLICIES AND HAS EXPELLED MANY OVERSEAS CHINESE. SO
ITS POLICY IS NOT ONE OF PEACE AND FRIENDSHIP, BUT OF
AGGRESSION. SOME CALL VIETNAM A COUNTRY WHICH DOESN'T
LIKE TO WORK, BUT ONLY TO EAT. IT PRACTICES HOOLIGANISM.
ONLY THE BIG HOOLIGAN THE SOVIET UNION SUPPORTS THIS
SMALL HOOLIGAN. SO WE DON'T SUPPORT IT.
24. VIETNAM'S WORD IS NOT CREDIBLE. AN EXAMPLE IS ITS
RELATIONS WITH ASEAN. FIRST IT OPPOSED THE ORGANIZATION.
NOW, IN ORDER TO SUPPORT ITS INVASION OF CAMBODIA, IT
WANTS IMPROVED RELATIONS WITH ASEAN. BUT VIETNAMESE
WORDS DO NOT COUNT. THEY SPREAD LIES EASILY. FOR
EXAMPLE, VIETNAM SPREAD THE RUMOR THAT VANG PAO MADE
A SECRET TRIP TO CHINA. I WOULD LIKE TO THINK OUR AMERICAN
FRIENDS FOR DISPROVING THIS LIE. AMERICAN JOURNALISTS
VISITED VANG PAO'S HOME, TOOK PICTURES, AND SHOWED THAT
HE HAD NEVER BEEN IN CHINA.
25. ONE MUST ADMIRE THE VIETNAMESE LEADERS. THEY
CAN CONCOCT LIES AND HURL ACCUSATIONS WITH EQUANIMITY
IN THEIR HEARTS. THEIR EYES DON'T FLINCH, AND THEY
NEVER FEEL ASHAMED. I HAVE TALKED AT GREAT LENGTH ABOUT
VIETNAM. WE PROVIDE VERY LITTLE AID TO CAMBODIA. WE
STARTED GIVING IT LONG AGO,WHEN WE WERE ALSO ASSISTING
VIETNAM. SO IT IS NOT JUST BECAUSE OF THE CONFLICT

TREATY LAOS HAD CEDED TO VIETNAM THE LAOTIAN PORTION
OF THE HO CHI MINH TRAIL. END SUMMARY.
2. A FOURTEEN MEMBER DELEGATION OF US CIVIC AFFAIRS
LEADERS HEADED BY BROOKINGS PRESIDENT BRUCE MCLAURY

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
MET WITH PRC VICE PREMIER KENG PIAO FOR TWO HOURS THE
MORNING OF NOVEMBER 25. AMBASSADOR WOODCOCK AND A USLO
NOTETAKER ALSO ATTENDED, AS DID HSIEH LI, SECRETARY
GENERAL OF THE CHINESE PEOPLE'S INSTITUTE OF FOREIGN
AFFAIRS, AND MFA AMERICAN AND OCEANIAN AFFAIRS DEPUTY
DIRECTOR TANG WEN-SHENG.
3. KENG OPENED THE DISCUSSION WITH SOME REMARKS ABOUT
A YELLOW RIVER IRRIGATION PROJECT BASED ON SOVIET PLANS
WHICH HE SAID HAD GONE WRONG. IN THE FUTURE, CHINA MUST
PLAN MOERE CAREFULLY, RECOGNIZE AND LEARN FROM ITS OWN
BACKWARDNESS, &quot;SEEK TRUTH FROM FACTS&quot; AND LEARN FROM
THE GOOD POINTS OF FOREIGN COUNTRIES. WHEN THE CHINESE
PEOPLE BECOME RICH, THEN THE COUNTRY WILL BE STRONG.
BUT NOW, FOR INSTANCE, THE AVERAGE PER CAPITA PRODUCTION
OF FOOD GRAINS IN CHINA IS ONLY 300 KG PER YEAR, WHICH
IS NOT ENOUGH. AGRICULTURE IS THE FIRST OF THE FOUR
MODERNIZATIONS, BUT INDUSTRY MUST ALSO BE MODERIZED,
FOR OTHERWISE IT WILL BE IMPOSSIBLE TO MECHANIZE
AGRICULTURE.
4. IN RESPONSE TO A QUESTION BY JAMES THOMSON OF HARVARD
ABOUT CHINA'S CRITERIA FOR JUDGING SOCIALISM IN
FOREIGN COUNTRIES, KENG LAUNCHED INTO A LONG ATTACK
ON THE SOVIET UNION. IT USED TO BE A SOCIALIST
COUNTRY AND A GREAT NEIGHBOR OF CHINA, BUT LATER IT
CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL
PAGE 03

PEKING 03849 01 OF 03 281230Z

CHANGES ITS POLICIES. IT OCCUPIED OTHER COUNTRIES
AND COMMITTED AGGRESSION. IT HAS NOT IMPROVED THE
LIVELIHOOD OF ITS OWN PEOPLE. IT SEEKS WORLD HEGEMONY,
WANTS TO SURPASS THE UNITED STATES, AND IN SOME AREAS
IS ALREADY AHEAD OF THE US.
5. CHINA USES THREE CRITERIA TO JUDGE WHETHER THE SOVIET
UNION IS A TRUE SOCIALIST COUNTRY OR IS SOCIAL
IMPERIALISM. ONE, WHETHER IT IMPLEMENTS SOCIALISM OR
FASCISM IN ITS DOMESTIC POLICIES. CHINA FEELS THAT
THE SOVIET UNION'S POLICIES ARE FASCIST. SECONDLY,
WHETHER IT PRACTICES SOCIAL IMPERIALISM OR INTERNATIONALISM IN ITS FOREIGN RELATIONS. IT SEEMS TO US THAT THE
SOVIET UNION DOES NOT PRACTICE INTERNATIONALISM, AS FOR
EXAMPLE IN ITS RELATIONS WITH THE COUNTRIES OF EASTERN
EUROPE, MONGOLIA AND CUBA. IT CONTROLS, EXPLOITS,
SUBVERTS AND OCCUPIES OTHER COUNTRIES. IT IS CONSTANTLY
TRYING TO EXPAND ITS TERRITORY, AND WANTS TO ANNEX PARTS
OF ITS NEIGHBORS' TERRITORY. AN EXAMPLE IS MONGOLIA,
WHICH HAS A LARGE TERRITORY AND A SMALL POPULATION. IT
HAS BEEN INDEPENDENT FOR 50 YEARS, BUT IS UNDER THE
COMPLETE CONTROL OF THE SOVIET UNION. MOSCOW HAS NEVER

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
HELPED IT, HAS NEVER PRACTICED INTERRNATIONALISM TOWARD
IT, SO THE PEOPLE THERE ARE STILL VERY POOR. TAKE ALSO
THE ORGANIZATION CALLED COMECON, AN ORGANIZATION
OF EXPLOITATION OF EASTERN EUROPE. THE COUNTRIES
THERE ARE SO EXPLOITED THAT THEY MUST LOOK TO THE WEST
FOR TRADE AND FOR ECONOMIC COOPERATION.
6. THE SOVIETS HAVE ALSO STATIONED TROOPS IN OTHER
COUNTRIES FOR LONG PERIODS OF TIME, CAUSING POPULAR
DISSATISFACTION. SOVIET TROOPS DIFFER FROM AMERICAN
TROOPS IN THAT THEIR PROVISIONS COME FROM THE OTHER
CUUNTRIES. IN HUNGARY THERE IS A POPULAR JOKE, IN
WHICH SEVERAL PEOPLE DISCUSS WHICH IS THE LARGEST
COUNTRY IN THE WORLD. ONE SAYS HUNGARY IS THE LARGEST.
CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL
PAGE 04

PEKING 03849 01 OF 03 281230Z

WHEN OTHERS ASK WHY, HE REPLIES THAT THE SOVIET TROOPS
IN HUNGARY WERE ORDERED TO WITHDRAW A LONG TIME AGO,
BUT THEY HAVE BEEN IN THE PROCESS OF WITHDRAWING FOR 20
OR 30 YEARS. SINCE THEY STILL HAVEN'T CROSSED THE
BORDER, HUNGARY MUST BE THE WORLD'S BIGGEST COUNTRY.
6. THE THIRD CRITERION FORSOCIALISM, KENG CONTINUE,
IS WHETHER THE SOVIET UNION REALLY HELPS NATIONAL
LIBERATION MOVEMENTS OR RATHER ACTS TO TURN NEWLY
LIBERATIED NATIONS INTO ITS OWN COLONIES. IN EGUYPT, FOR
EXAMPLE, MOSCOW SOLD THEM MAINLY ARMS AT A VERY HIGH
PRICE. WHEN EGYPT PROVED UNABLE TO REPAY THE DEBTS, THE
SOVIETS DEMANDED REPAYMENT IN SUCH GOODS A LONG-FIBER
COTTON. THEY ALSO USED THE SALE OF ARMS AS AN EXCUSE
TO SEND ADVISORS IN AN ATTEMPT TO CONTROL EGYPT'S ARMY.
IN THIS WAY RELATIONS BECAME WORSE. THE SAME THING
HAPPENED IN SOMALIA. WHEN THE SOMALIS WERE BUYING ARMS
FROM THE SOVIET UNION, MOSCOW CONSIDERED SOMALIA A
REVOLUTIONARY COUNTRY. BUT WHEN THE SOVIETS SET
CONDITIONS, THE SOMALIS REJECTED THEM, AND THE SOVIET
UNION WITHDREW ALL ITS AID, CLLING SOMALIA A REACTIONARY, COUNTERREVOLUTIONARY COUNTRY.
7. THE SAME HAS HAPPENED WITH RESPECT TO CHINA. IN
1956, MOSCOW ASKED THE PRC TO JOIN COMECON, BUT WE DID
NOT. WE SENT ONLY AN OBSERVER. THE SOVIETS PROPOSED
THAT CHINA DEVELOP ITS ONLY AGRICULTURE, IN ORDER TO
SUPPLY GRAIN TO THE SOVIET UNION AND EASTERN EUROPE.
IF CHINA NEEDED MACHINERY, THESE COUNTRIES WOULD SUPPLY
IT. THE SOVIETS HOPED CHINA WOULD REMAIN FOREVER A BACKWARD AGRICULTURAL COUNTRY, A SUPPLIER OF GRAIN. THIS
WAS UNACCEPTABLE TO CHINA. LATER THE SOVIET UNION
MADE OTHER UNACCEPTABLE DEMANDS. THE FACT THAT OUR

RELATIONS HAVE NOW BECOME AGGRAVATED TO SUCH AN EXTENT
IS COMPLETELY THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE SOVIET UNION.
8. THESE ARE ONLY A FEW EXAMPLES. THE SOVIET UNION ACTTS
THIS WAY NOT ONLY IN ITS CRELATIONS WITH CHINA, BUT ALSO
WITH OTHER COUNTRIES. THUS THROUGH THESE THREE CRITERIA
WE CAN JUDGE SOVIET CONDUCT. AS FOR COUNTRIES LIKE
ROMANIA AND YUGOSLAVIA, THEY ARE DIFFERENT, SINCE THEY
PAY ATTENTION TO THEIR PEOPLE'S LIVELIHOOD AND HAVE NO
AGGRESSIVE INTENTIONS TOWARDS OTHERS.

MECHANIZATION IS ONLY IN ITS INITIAL STAGES, AND IS
TO BE COMPLETED IN 23 YEARS. THAT IS A LONG TIME.
AFTER STUDY AND INVESTIGATION, WE DECIDED TO GIVE OUR
PRIORITY TO INDUSTRY. WEST GERMANY AND JAPAN BOTH
DEVELOPED RAPIDLY AFTER WORLD WAR II ALTHOUGH THEY HAD
SUFFERED SERIOUS DESTRUCTION. IT TOOK WEST GERMANY 15
YEARS AND JAPAN 13 YEARS TO MODERNIZE. CHINA HAS A
LARGE TERRITORY AND IS VERY POOR, SO WE ASSUME IT WILL
TAKE US LONGER. THUS WE ALLOW 23 YEARS. WE HAVE FULL
CONFIDENCE THAT WE WILL REALIZE THIS GOAL. WE HAVE A

GREAT DEAL OF EXPERIENCE, BOTH POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE,
AND WE MUST SUM IT UP. THE ENTIRE CHINESE PEOPLE IS
CONFIDENT THAT WE CAN DEVELOP OUR COUNTRY. JUST LIKE IN
WALKING, WE MUST TAKE FIRM STEPS, ONE AT A TIME, AND
NEVER STOP.
10. PHILLIPS RUOPP OF THE CHARLES F. KETTERING FOUNDATION
REFERRED TO KENG'S RECENT AFRICAN TRIP AND ASKED ABOUT
CHINESE SUPPORT FOR ZIMBABWE LIBERATION MOVEMENTS AND
ABOUT THEIR ATTITUDE TOWARD THE ANGLO-AMERICAN PLAN FOR
RHODESIAN INDEPENDENCE. KENG REPLIED: WE SUPPORT THESE
PEOPLE'S ORGANIZATION. WE ALSO BELIEVE THEY RECOGNIZE
THAT WHILE WE SUPPORT OTHERS, OUR ABILITIES ARE LIMITED.
CHINA BELONGS TO THE THIRD WORLD AND IS A DEVELOPING
COUNTRY. OUR ASSISTANCE IS MEAGER, BUT THEY KNOW THAT
IT IS GIVEN WITH SINCERITY. IT IS TRUE THAT I RECENTLY
VISITED AFRICA, SEVEN COUNTRIES IN ALL. THE SOVIET
UNION SAYS WE ARE ENGAGED IN A MAJOR DIPLOMATIC
OFFENSIVE AGAINST THEM. THAT IS TRUE, IT IS DIRECTED
AGAINST THEM. BUT THERE ARE ALSO OTHER ASPECTS. FOR
OVER TEN YEARS, MANY THIRD WORLD LEADERS HAVE VISITED
CHINA, SOME OF THEM MORE THAN ONCE. VERY FEW CHINESE
LEADERS WENT ABROAD DURING THIS TIME. CHAIRMAN MAO WAS
OLD AND IN POOR HEALTH. PREMIER CHOU WAS ALSO OLD, AND
HAD TO COPE WITH THE PROBLEMS CAUSED BY LIN PIAO AND THE
GANG OF FOUR. OTHER VICE PREMIERS WERE TARGETS, AND SOME
WERE STRUCK DOWN BY THE GANG. NOW WITH THE FALL OF THE
GANG OF FOUR WE CAN SEND OUR LEADERS ABROAD ONCE AGAIN.
IN TERMS OF DIPLOMATIC RECIPROCITY WE OWE OTHER COUNTRIES
MANY DEBTS. IT IS TIME TO REPAY THESE DEBTS. FIRST OF
ALL, WE WANT TO PAY THE DEBTS, AND SECONDLY WE WISH TO
INCREASE UNDERSTANDING WITH OTHER COUNTRIES, STRENGTHEN
OUR FRIENDSHIP, AND BUILD UP OUR BILATERAL RELATIONS.

BUT OUR ASSISTANCE IS MEAGER, AND IS MAINLY IN THE
ECONOMIC FIELD, IN ORDER TO HELP THEM STAND ON THEIR
OWN FEET.
11. HOWARD SQUADRON, PRESIDENT OF THE AMERICAN JEWISH
CONGRESS, REFERRED TO HIS RECENT CONTACTS WITH AMERICAN
AND ISRAEL LEADERS ON THE SUBJECT OF THE MIDDLE EAST
PEACE NEGOTIATIONS AND ASKED WHETHER THE PRC WOULD
CONSIDER ESTABLISHING DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS WITH ISRAEL
IN THE EVENT A PEACE TREATY IS SIGNED. KENG REPLIED:
THER AE TWO PEOPLES IN THE WORLD WHO LOVE THEIR
COUNTRIES THE MOST, THE JEWISH PEOPLE AND THE CHINESE.
I AM QUOTING VICE PREMIER TENG HSIAO-PING. WITH RESPECT
TO THE MIDDLE EAST, WE HOPE FOR PEACE. IT IS ALWAYS
GOOD TO HAVE NO WAR. BUT ISRAEL HAS OCCUPIED TOO MANY
PLACES BELONGING TO OTHERS, AND OFFENDED TOO MANY
PEOPLE. IF THERE CAN WITHDRAW FROM THESE PLACES, IF NOT
COMPLETELY, THEN FROM MOST OF THEM, WON'T PEACE BE
REALIZED? SO MANY ARAB COUNTRIES OPPOSE ISRAEL; MANY OF
THEM BECAUSE THEY HAVE HAD THEIR TERRITORY OCCUPIED BY
ISRAEL. IF ISRAEL CAN SOLVE ITS PROBLEMS WITH SADAT
AND WITH THE PALESTINIANS, RESOLVING THE QUESTION OF A
HOMELAND, THEN THERE WILL BE GREAT PROSPECTS FOR PEACE
IN THE MIDDLE EAST.
12. NOW THE SOVIET UNION HAS ORGANIZED A REJECTIONIST
FRONT, AND WANTS TO EXPAND IT. WE HAVE MADE NO PUBLIC
DOCUMENT IN THE NEWSPAPERS ON THIS QUESTION. BECAUSE
THE ACCORDS REACHED AT CAMP DAVID HAVE NOT YET BEEN
IMPLEMENTED, WE DON'T KNOW WHAT WILL HAPPEN IN THE FUTURE.
EVERYONE IS NOW WATCHING HOW THE AGREEMENTS WILL BE
IMPLEMENTED. WE HOPE THAT PEACE CAN BE ACHIEVED, BUT IT
IS NOT GOING TO BE EASY. IT REQUIRES REDOUBLED EFFORTS.
IF YOU WANT ME TO SAY MORE, I CAN ONLY SAY THAT CHINA
IS IN NO POSITION TO HELP. WE HOPE THE UNITED STATES
WILL STEP UP ITS EFFORTS. IT IS JUST LIKE A TUG-OFCONFIDENTIAL

WAR; IF THE US SLACKENS ITS EFFORTS THEN THE SOVIETS
WILL GET MORE.
13. PHILLIP JOHNSON, PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL ON
RELIGION AND INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS, ASKED WHETHER THE
PRC WILL CONTINUE TO TAKE PART IN DISARMAMENT EFFORTS
AS IT DID IN THE UNITED NATIONS THIS YEAR. KENG REPLIED:
CHINA IS TAKING PART IN DISARMAMENT NEGOTIATIONS,
ESPECIALLY WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF THE UNITED NATIONS.
BUT WE DO NOT INTEND TO TAKE PART IN SPECIALIZED
AGENCIES. OUR POSITION IS DIFFERENT FROM THAT OF THE

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
US AND THE SOVIET UNION. YOU HOLD NEGOTIATIONS ON
BANNING THIS OR THAT TYPE OF WEAPON OR ON SOME TYPE OF
LIMITATIONS, ACTUALLY THOSE WEAPONS KEEP ON
DEVELOPING.
14. MCLAUREY ASKED ABOUT THE POSSIBLE CONFLICT BETWEEN
CHINESE APPROVAL OF NATO AND THE COMMON MARKET AND ITS
RELATIONS WITH COMMUNIST PARTIES IN ITALY, FRANCE AND
SPAIN. KENG REPLIED: WE HAVE NOT PUBLICLY APPROVED
NATO, ONLY THE COMMON MARKET. THE COMMON MARKET IS
AN ECONOMIC ORGANIZATION DESIGNED FOR ECONOMIC EXCHANGES
AND TRADE, AND IT IS NOT BAD. WE HAVE SENT AN AMBASSADOR
TO THE EC. THE SOVIETS, HOWEVER, OPPOSE IT. THEY WANT
TO PUT EASTERN EUROPE UNDER THEIR COMPLETE CONTROL, SO
THAT ONLY THE SOVIET UNION CAN HAVE CONTACT WITH THE
EC. THE EASTERN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES DO NOT APPROVE
THIS POLICY.
15. AS FOR EUROCOMMUNISM, THE COMMON MARKET IS NOT THE
PROBLEM. WE HAVE LONG-STANDING CONTRADICTIONS WITH
EUROCOMMUNISM. THEY ORIGINALLY FOLLOWED THE SOVIET
UNION IN DENOUNCING CHINA, SO THEY ARE IN DEBT TO US.

IF THEY SHOULD COME TO POWER, THEY WILL PRACTICE
APPEASEMENT AND HELP THE SOVIET UNION.
16. RITA GOODMAN OF THE JOHNSON FOUNDATION ASKED HOW
DELEGATION MEMBERS COULD HELP AMERICAN BETTER UNDERSTAND
CHINA. KENG REPLIED THAT WRITTEN INFORMATION WAS RATHER
SCANTY, SINCE AUTHORS DID NOT DARE TO WRITEE ANYTHING IN
THE PAST TEN YEARS FOR FEAR OF BEING QUOTED OUT OF
CONTEXT AND ATTACKED. HE ENCOURAGED INCREASED VISITS
TO THE PRC BY AMERICANS. HE THEN REFERRED TO STUDENT
EXCHANGES. IN THE FUTURE THESE EXCHANGES WILL INCREASE.
CHINA PLANS TO SEND MANY PEOPLE TO STUDY IN THE UNITED
STATES. WE WILL ENCOURAGE THEM TO LIVE IN AMERICAN
FAMILIES IN ORDER TO BOTH LEARN THE LANGUAGE AND TO
LEARN OTHER KNOWLEDGE. IF AMERICANS WANT TO LEARN ABOUT
CHINA, PERHAPS THESE STUDENTS CAN HELP.
17. STEPHEN RHKINESMITH OF AFS ASKED ABOUT CHINA'S
POSITION AS A LEADER OF ASIA IN THE NEXT FEW YEARS AND

SOCIALIST COUNTRY. IT USED TO BE AN OPPRESSED
COUNTRY; FRANCE COMMITTED AGGRESSION AGAINST IT. THE
UNITED STATES WAS AT WAR WITH VIETNAM FOR MANY YEARS,
AND CHINA SUPPORTED VIETNAM. WE GAVE THEM A GREAT DEAL
OF ASSISTANCE, WORTH MORE THAN $20 BILLION. BUT AFTER
THEIR VICTORY, THEIR AMBITION GREW GREATER AND GREATER.
DURING HO CHI MINH'S LIFETIME THIS AMBITION ALREADY
EXISTED, BUT IT HAS BECOME MORE OBVIOUS NOW. VIETNAM
WANTS TO SET UP AN INDOCHINA FEDERATION AND ANNEX LAOS
AND CAMBODIA. CHINA DOES NOT SUPPORT THIS AMBITION,
BUT THE SOVIET UNION DOES. ALTHOUGH WE GAVE VIETNAM A
GREAT DEAL OF ASSISTANCE, SINCE WE DO NOT SUPPORT ITS
AMBITION, IT HAS TURNED AGAINST US.

18. LAOS HAS ALREADY BEEN VIRTUALLY ANNEXED. VIETNAM
SENT FIVE DIVISIONS THERE AND HAS STATIONED THEM THERE
FOR OVER TEN YEARS.THEY HAVE ALSO SENT MANY ADVISORY
GROUPS WHICH ARE EVERYWHERE FROM THE CENTRAL GOVERNMENT
TO THE GRASS ROOTS. WHEN THE UNITED STATES WAS INVOLVED
IN THE WAR, EVERYONE KNOWS HOW DIFFICULT IT WAS FOR
VIETNAM TO TRANSPORT THINGS TO THE SOUTH. SO THEY SET
UP THE HO CHI MINH TRAIL FROM LAOS IN THE NORTH TO
CAMBODIA IN THE SOUTH. LAST YEAR LAOS AND VIETNAM
SIGNED A NEW BOUNDARY TREATY, ACCORDING TO WHICH THE
LAOTIAN PART OF THE HO CHI MINH TRAIL IS NOW INCLUDED
IN VIETNAM'S TERRITORY. BUT THE SOUTHERN PART IS IN
CAMBODIA, AND WHEN VIETNAM RAISED THE SAME DEMAND, THE
CAMBODIANS REFUSED. THERE ARE ALSO TWO OTHER AREAS

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
BELONGING TO CAMBODIA, THE PARROT'S BEAK AND THE
FISHHOOOK. DURING THE WAR, VIETNAMESE GUERRILLAS TRIED
TO BORROW THESE AREAS AS REAR BASES, AND SIHANOUK
PROMISED THEM TO THEM. BUT AFTER THE VICTORY, WHEN
VIETNAM DEMANDED THE FULL INCORPORATION OF THESE TWO
AREAS, CAMBODI REFUSED. VIETNAM ALSO DEMANDED THAT
CAMBODIA JOIN AN INDOCHINA FEDERATION, AND CAMBODIA
REFUSED THAT. THEN VIETNAM SENT ITS TROOPS TO ATTACK
CAMBODIA AND PENETRATED UP TO 30 KILOMETERS. THEY SENT
SIX DIVISIONS TO ATTACK, BUT THEY WERE DEFEATED BY THE
CAMBODIANS. AT THE SAME TIME, VIETNAM ENGAGED IN SUBVERSION. THEY ATTEMPTED TO ORGANIZE A NEW GOVERNMENT IN
ORDER TO OVERTHROW THE PRESENT ONE.
19. VIETNAM SAYS THAT CAMBODIA ATTACKED THEM, THAT
CAMBODIA IS THE AGGRESSORS. I DON'T KNOW WHETHER YOU
BELIEVE IT OR NOT, BUT OTHERS DON'T. VIETNAM HAS 50
MILLION PEOPLE, WHILE CAMBODIA'S POPULATION IS 7 MILLION.
VIETNAM'S ARMED FORCES ARE AS STRONG AS THEY WERE DURING

PAGE 03

PEKING 03849 03 OF 03 271125Z

THE WAR, OVER 600,000 AND STILL EXPANDING. CAMBODIA HAS
ONLY ONE-SIXTH OF THIS. HOW COULD CAMBODIA ATTACK
VIETNAM? IT IS IMPOSSIBLE.
20. SOME PEOPLE ARE WORRIED
THAT VIETNAM MAY BE ABLE TO OCCUPY CAMBODIA. I AM AN
OPTIMIST, AND I DON'T BELIEVE IT. EVEN IF THEY OCCUPY
PHNOM PENH, VIETNAM CANNOT TAKE OVER ALL OF CAMBOIDA.
THE STRENGTH OF CAMBODI LIES NOT IN THE CITIES, BUT
IN THE COUNTRYSIDE.
21. WHY HAS THE SOVIET UNION SUCH A GREAT INTEREST
IN VIETNAM? IT IS MAINLY IN THE USE OF HARBORS, NAVAL
AND AIR BASES BUILT BY THE UNITED STATES. EVEN AFTER
ITS VICTORY, VIETNAM STILL MAINTAINS A LARGE ARMED
FORCE. FIFTY MILLION PEOPLE MUST FEED THIS FORCE, AND
THEY CANNOT DO IT BY RELYING ON THEIR OWN EFFORTS. THE
US THREW IN THE SPONGE IN VIETNAM BECAUSE NIXON WANTED
TO SHIFT HIS STRATEGIC FOCUS TO EUROPE. BUT THE VIETNAMES THOUGHT THEY HAD SUCCEEDED IN DRIVING AWAY THE
US TROOPS WITH MILITARY STRENGTH. AFTER THE WAR,
VIETNAM FAILED TO DEVELOP ITS PRODUCTION. THEY SHOULD
AT LEAST HEAL THEWOUNDS OF WAR, REHABILITATE PRODUCTIVE
FACILITIES, AND SOLVE THE FOOD PROBLEM, BUT THEY HAVE
BEEN UNABLE TO DO SO. THEY FAILED TO UNITE THE PEOPLE
OF VARIOUS STRATA. FOR INSTANCE, THEY CAST AWAY MANY
BUDDHIST MONKS WHO HAD SUPPORTED THEM. THEY CONFISCATED
THE PROPERTY OF FACTORIES AND SMALL SHOPS. THIS IS A
POLICY OF PLUNDER, NOT OF DEVELOPMENT. THEY CONFISCATED
ALL THE VALUABLES OWNED BY FAMILIES, SO MANY PEOPLE BECAME

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
DISSATISFIED WITH THE GOVERNMENT.
22. IN THE SOVIET UNION THERE IS AN ORGANIZATION CALLED
THE KGB. IT IS AT LEAST AS LARGE AS THE CIA. VIETNAM
IS NOW FOLLOWING THE SOVIET EXAMPLE. THEY WANT TO
CONTROL THE PEOPLE THROUGH SUCH ORGANIZATIONS. BUT
CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL
PAGE 04

PEKING 03849 03 OF 03 271125Z

THIS IS NOT RELIABLE. IT WILL ONLY CAUSE AVERSION
AMONG THE PEOPLE.
23. SINCE ITS VICTORY, VIETNAM HAS FAILED TO ESTABLISH
GOOD RELATIONS WITH ITS NEIGHBORS. IT LAYS TERRITORIAL
CLAIMS ON NEIGHBORING COUNTRIES. IT OCCUPIED THE
SPRATLY ISLANDS, WHICH ARE CHINESE TERRITORY, AND HAS
PROVOKED MANY BORDER INCIDENTS. IT FOLLOWS SOVIET
POLICIES AND HAS EXPELLED MANY OVERSEAS CHINESE. SO
ITS POLICY IS NOT ONE OF PEACE AND FRIENDSHIP, BUT OF
AGGRESSION. SOME CALL VIETNAM A COUNTRY WHICH DOESN'T
LIKE TO WORK, BUT ONLY TO EAT. IT PRACTICES HOOLIGANISM.
ONLY THE BIG HOOLIGAN THE SOVIET UNION SUPPORTS THIS
SMALL HOOLIGAN. SO WE DON'T SUPPORT IT.
24. VIETNAM'S WORD IS NOT CREDIBLE. AN EXAMPLE IS ITS
RELATIONS WITH ASEAN. FIRST IT OPPOSED THE ORGANIZATION.
NOW, IN ORDER TO SUPPORT ITS INVASION OF CAMBODIA, IT
WANTS IMPROVED RELATIONS WITH ASEAN. BUT VIETNAMESE
WORDS DO NOT COUNT. THEY SPREAD LIES EASILY. FOR
EXAMPLE, VIETNAM SPREAD THE RUMOR THAT VANG PAO MADE
A SECRET TRIP TO CHINA. I WOULD LIKE TO THINK OUR AMERICAN
FRIENDS FOR DISPROVING THIS LIE. AMERICAN JOURNALISTS
VISITED VANG PAO'S HOME, TOOK PICTURES, AND SHOWED THAT
HE HAD NEVER BEEN IN CHINA.
25. ONE MUST ADMIRE THE VIETNAMESE LEADERS. THEY
CAN CONCOCT LIES AND HURL ACCUSATIONS WITH EQUANIMITY
IN THEIR HEARTS. THEIR EYES DON'T FLINCH, AND THEY
NEVER FEEL ASHAMED. I HAVE TALKED AT GREAT LENGTH ABOUT
VIETNAM. WE PROVIDE VERY LITTLE AID TO CAMBODIA. WE
STARTED GIVING IT LONG AGO,WHEN WE WERE ALSO ASSISTING
VIETNAM. SO IT IS NOT JUST BECAUSE OF THE CONFLICT

YOU THAT THERE WON'T BE ANY MAJOR DEVELOPMENTS.IF VIETNAM
ATTACKS CHINA, WE WILL OPEN THE DOOR WIDE AND LET THEM
IN. BUT CHINA IS A BIG COUNTRY, AND IT WILL BE UP TO
THEM TO TRY TO GET OUT.
