		<h3>Tor</h3>
		<p><a href="https://www.torproject.org">Tor</a> is an encrypted anonymising network that makes it harder to intercept internet communications, or see where communications are coming from or going to.</p>
		<p>In order to use the WikiLeaks public submission system as detailed above you can download the Tor Browser Bundle, which is a Firefox-like browser available for Windows, Mac OS X and GNU/Linux and pre-configured to connect using the anonymising system Tor.</p>
		<h4>Tails</h4>
		<p>If you are at high risk and you have the capacity to do so, you can also access the submission system through a secure operating system called <a href="https://tails.boum.org">Tails</a>. Tails is an operating system launched from a USB stick or a DVD that aim to leaves no traces when the computer is shut down after use and automatically routes your internet traffic through Tor. Tails will require you to have either a USB stick or a DVD at least 4GB big and a laptop or desktop computer.</p>

		<h3>Tips</h3>
		<p>Our submission system works hard to preserve your anonymity, but we recommend you also take some of your own precautions. Please review these basic guidelines. </p>
		<div>
			<h4>1. Contact us if you have specific problems</h4>
			<p>If you have a very large submission, or a submission with a complex format, or are a high-risk source, please <a href="#submit_help_contact">contact us</a>. In our experience it is always possible to find a custom solution for even the most seemingly difficult situations.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h4>2. What computer to use</h4>
			<p>If the computer you are uploading from could subsequently be audited in an investigation, consider using a computer that is not easily tied to you. Technical users can also use <a href="https://tails.boum.org">Tails</a> to help ensure you do not leave any records of your submission on the computer.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h4>3. Do not talk about your submission to others</h4>
			<p>If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in source protection – it is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This includes other media organisations.</p>
		</div>

	</div>
</div>

<div id="submit_help_after" class="submit_elem">

			</div>
		</div>

		<h3>After</h3>

		<div>
			<h4>1. Do not talk about your submission to others</h4>
			<p>If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in source protection – it is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This includes other media organisations.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h4>2. Act normal</h4>
			<p>If you are a high-risk source, avoid saying anything or doing anything after submitting which might promote suspicion. In particular, you should try to stick to your normal routine and behaviour.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h4>3. Remove traces of your submission</h4>
			<p>If you are a high-risk source and the computer you prepared your submission on, or uploaded it from, could subsequently be audited in an investigation, we recommend that you format and dispose of the computer hard drive and any other storage media you used.</p>
			<p>In particular, hard drives retain data after formatting which may be visible to a digital forensics team and flash media (USB sticks, memory cards and SSD drives) retain data even after a secure erasure. If you used flash media to store sensitive data, it is important to destroy the media.</p>
			<p>If you do this and are a high-risk source you should make sure there are no traces of the clean-up, since such traces themselves may draw suspicion.</p>
			<div>
				<h4>4. If you face legal action</h4>
				<p>If a legal action is brought against you as a result of your submission, there are organisations that may help you. The Courage Foundation is an international organisation dedicated to the protection of journalistic sources. You can find more details at <a href="https://www.couragefound.org">https://www.couragefound.org</a>.</p>

		<p>WikiLeaks publishes documents of political or historical importance that are censored or otherwise suppressed. We specialise in strategic global publishing and large archives.</p>
		<p>The following is the address of our secure site where you can anonymously upload your documents to WikiLeaks editors. You can only access this submissions system through Tor. (See our <a href="#submit_help_tor">Tor tab</a> for more information.) We also advise you to read our <a href="#submit_help_tips">tips for sources</a> before submitting.</p>

   It wasn't going to Urumqi, but to Xi'an. <br />

   Regardless, will definitely have a look.<br />

<br />
Accounts by disgraced scientist assert China gave Pakistan enough enriched<br />
uranium in 1982 to make two bombs<br />
<br />
<br />
     By R. Jeffrey Smith and Joby Warrick<br />
     Washington Post Staff Writer <br />
     Friday, November 13, 2009<br />
<br />
     In 1982, a Pakistani military C-130 left the western Chinese city of<br />
     Urumqi with a highly unusual cargo: enough weapons-grade uranium for two<br />
     atomic bombs, according to accounts written by the father<br />
     of Pakistan's nuclear weapons program, Abdul Qadeer Khan, and provided<br />
     to The Washington Post.<br />
<br />
     The uranium transfer in five stainless-steel boxes was part of a<br />
     broad-ranging, secret nuclear deal approved years earlier by Mao Zedong<br />
     and Prime Minister Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto that culminated in an<br />
     exceptional, deliberate act of proliferation by a nuclear power,<br />
     according to the accounts by Khan, who is under house arrest in<br />
     Pakistan.<br />
<br />
     U.S. officials say they have known about the transfer for decades and<br />
     once privately confronted the Chinese -- who denied it -- but have never<br />
     raised the issue in public or sought to impose direct sanctions<br />
     on China for it. President Obama, who said in April that &quot;the world must<br />
     stand together to prevent the spread of these weapons,&quot; plans to discuss<br />
     nuclear proliferation issues while visiting Beijing on Tuesday.<br />
<br />
     According to Khan, the uranium cargo came with a blueprint for a simple<br />
     weapon that China had already tested, supplying a virtual do-it-yourself<br />
     kit that significantly speeded Pakistan's bomb effort. The transfer also<br />
     started a chain of proliferation: U.S. officials worry that Khan later<br />
     shared related Chinese design information with Iran; in 2003, Libya<br />
     confirmed obtaining it from Khan's clandestine network.<br />
<br />
     China's refusal to acknowledge the transfer and the unwillingness of the<br />
     United States to confront the Chinese publicly demonstrate how difficult<br />
     it is to counter nuclear proliferation. Although U.S. officials say<br />
     China is now much more attuned to proliferation dangers, it has<br />
     demonstrated less enthusiasm than the United States for imposing<br />
     sanctions on Iran over its nuclear efforts, a position Obama wants to<br />
     discuss.<br />
<br />
     Although Chinese officials have for a quarter-century denied helping any<br />
     nation attain a nuclear capability, current and former U.S. officials<br />
     say Khan's accounts confirm the U.S. intelligence community's long-held<br />
     conclusion that China provided such assistance.<br />
<br />
     &quot;Upon my personal request, the Chinese Minister . . . had gifted us 50<br />
     kg [kilograms] of weapon-grade enriched uranium, enough for two<br />
     weapons,&quot; Khan wrote in a previously undisclosed 11-page narrative of<br />
     the Pakistani bomb program that he prepared after his January 2004<br />
     detention for unauthorized nuclear commerce.<br />
<br />
     &quot;The Chinese gave us drawings of the nuclear weapon, gave us kg50<br />
     enriched uranium,&quot; he said in a separate account sent to his wife<br />
     several months earlier.<br />
<br />
     China's Foreign Ministry last week declined to address Khan's specific<br />
     assertions, but it said that as a member of the global Non-Proliferation<br />
     Treaty since 1992, &quot;China strictly adheres to the international duty of<br />
     prevention of proliferation it shoulders and strongly opposes . . .<br />
     proliferation of nuclear weapons in any forms.&quot;<br />
<br />
     Asked why the U.S. government has never publicly confronted China over<br />
     the uranium transfer, State Department spokesman Philip J. Crowley said,<br />
     &quot;The United States has worked diligently and made progress with China<br />
     over the past 25 years. As to what was or wasn't done during the Reagan<br />
     administration, I can't say.&quot;<br />
<br />
     Khan's exploits have been described in multiple books and public reports<br />
     since British and U.S. intelligence services unmasked the deeds in 2003.<br />
     But his own narratives -- not yet seen by U.S. officials -- provide<br />
     fresh details about China's aid to Pakistan and its reciprocal export to<br />
     China of sensitive uranium-enrichment technology.<br />
<br />
     A spokesman for the Pakistani Embassy in Washington declined to comment<br />
     for this article. Pakistan has never allowed the U.S. government to<br />
     question Khan or other top Pakistani officials directly, prompting<br />
     Congress to demand in legislation approved in September that future aid<br />
     be withheld until Obama certifies that Pakistan has provided &quot;relevant<br />
     information from or direct access to Pakistani nationals&quot; involved in<br />
     past nuclear commerce.<br />
<br />
     Insider vs. government<br />
<br />
<br />
     The Post obtained Khan's detailed accounts from Simon Henderson, a<br />
     former journalist at the Financial Times who is now a senior fellow at<br />
     the Washington Institute for Near East Policy and who has maintained<br />
     correspondence with Khan. In a first-person account about his contacts<br />
     with Khan in the Sept. 20 edition of the London Sunday Times, Henderson<br />
     disclosed several excerpts from one of the documents.<br />
<br />
     Henderson said he agreed to The Post's request for a copy of that letter<br />
     and other documents and narratives written by Khan because he believes<br />
     an accurate understanding of Pakistan's nuclear history is relevant for<br />
     U.S. policymaking. The Post independently confirmed the authenticity of<br />
     the material; it also corroborated much of the content through<br />
     interviews in Pakistan and other countries.<br />
<br />
     Although Khan disputes various assertions by book authors, the<br />
     narratives are particularly at odds with Pakistan's official statements<br />
     that he exported nuclear secrets as a rogue agent and implicated only<br />
     former government officials who are no longer living. Instead, he<br />
     repeatedly states that top politicians and military officers were<br />
     immersed in the country's foreign nuclear dealings.<br />
<br />
     Khan has complained to friends that his movements and contacts are being<br />
     unjustly controlled by the government, whose bidding he did -- providing<br />
     a potential motive for his disclosures.<br />
<br />
     Overall, the narratives portray his deeds as a form of sustained,<br />
     high-tech international horse-trading, in which Khan and a series of top<br />
     generals successfully leveraged his access to Europe's best centrifuge<br />
     technology in the 1980s to obtain financial assistance or technical<br />
     advice from foreign governments that wanted to advance their own<br />
     efforts.<br />

<br />
     &quot;The speed of our work and our achievements surprised our worst enemies<br />
     and adversaries and the West stood helplessly by to see a Third World<br />
     nation, unable even to produce bicycle chains or sewing needles,<br />
     mastering the most advanced nuclear technology in the shortest possible<br />
     span of time,&quot; Khan boasts in the 11-page narrative he wrote for<br />
     Pakistani intelligence officials about his dealings with foreigners<br />
     while head of a key nuclear research laboratory.<br />
<br />
     Exchanges with Beijing<br />
<br />
     According to one of the documents, a five-page summary by Khan of his<br />
     government's dealmaking with China, the terms of the nuclear exchange<br />
     were set in a mid-1976 conversation between Mao and Bhutto. Two years<br />
     earlier, neighboring India had tested its first nuclear bomb, provoking<br />
     Khan -- a metallurgist working at a Dutch centrifuge manufacturer -- to<br />
     offer his services to Bhutto.<br />
<br />
     Khan said he and two other Pakistani officials -- including then-Foreign<br />
     Secretary Agha Shahi, since deceased -- worked out the details when they<br />
     traveled to Beijing later that year for Mao's funeral. Over several<br />
     days, Khan said, he briefed three top Chinese nuclear weapons officials<br />
     -- Liu Wei, Li Jue and Jiang Shengjie -- on how the European-designed<br />
     centrifuges could swiftly aid China's lagging uranium-enrichment<br />
     program. China's Foreign Ministry did not respond to questions about the<br />
     officials' roles.<br />
<br />
     &quot;Chinese experts started coming regularly to learn the whole technology&quot;<br />
     from Pakistan, Khan states, staying in a guesthouse built for them at<br />
     his centrifuge research center. Pakistani experts were dispatched to<br />
     Hanzhong in central China, where they helped &quot;put up a centrifuge<br />
     plant,&quot; Khan said in an account he gave to his wife after coming under<br />
     government pressure. &quot;We sent 135 C-130 plane loads of machines,<br />
     inverters, valves, flow meters, pressure gauges,&quot; he wrote. &quot;Our teams<br />
     stayed there for weeks to help and their teams stayed here for weeks at<br />
     a time.&quot;<br />
<br />
     In return, China sent Pakistan 15 tons of uranium hexafluoride (UF6), a<br />
     feedstock for Pakistan's centrifuges that Khan's colleagues were having<br />
     difficulty producing on their own. Khan said the gas enabled the<br />
     laboratory to begin producing bomb-grade uranium in 1982. Chinese<br />
     scientists helped the Pakistanis solve other nuclear weapons challenges,<br />
     but as their competence rose, so did the fear of top Pakistani officials<br />
     thatIsrael or India might preemptively strike key nuclear sites.<br />
<br />
     Mohammed Zia ul-Haq, the nation's military ruler, &quot;was worried,&quot; Khan<br />
     said, and so he and a Pakistani general who helped oversee the nation's<br />
     nuclear laboratories were dispatched to Beijing with a request in<br />
     mid-1982 to borrow enough bomb-grade uranium for a few weapons.<br />
<br />
     After winning Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping's approval, Khan, the general<br />
     and two others flew aboard a Pakistani C-130 to Urumqi. Khan says they<br />
     enjoyed barbecued lamb while waiting for the Chinese military to pack<br />
     the small uranium bricks into lead-lined boxes, 10 single-kilogram<br />
     ingots to a box, for the flight to Islamabad, Pakistan's capital.<br />
<br />
     According to Khan's account, however, Pakistan's nuclear scientists kept<br />
     the Chinese material in storage until 1985, by which time the Pakistanis<br />
     had made a few bombs with their own uranium. Khan said he got Zia's<br />
     approval to ask the Chinese whether they wanted their high-enriched<br />
     uranium back. After a few days, they responded &quot;that the HEU loaned<br />
     earlier was now to be considered as a gift . . . in gratitude&quot; for<br />
     Pakistani help, Khan said.<br />
<br />
     He said the laboratory promptly fabricated hemispheres for two weapons<br />
     and added them to Pakistan's arsenal. Khan's view was that none of this<br />
     violated the 1968 Non-Proliferation Treaty, because neither nation had<br />
     signed it at the time and neither had sought to use its capability<br />
     &quot;against any country in particular.&quot; He also wrote that subsequent<br />
     international protests reeked of hypocrisy because of foreign assistance<br />
     to nuclear weapons programs in Britain, Israel and South Africa.<br />
<br />
     U.S. unaware of progress<br />
<br />
     The United States was suspicious of Pakistani-Chinese collaboration<br />
     through this period. Officials knew that China treasured its<br />
     relationship with Pakistan because both worried about India; they also<br />
     knew that China viewed Western nuclear policies as discriminatory and<br />
     that some Chinese politicians had favored the spread of nuclear arms as<br />
     a path to stability.<br />
<br />
     But U.S. officials were ignorant about key elements of the cooperation<br />
     as it unfolded, according to current and former officials and classified<br />
     documents.<br />
<br />
     China is &quot;not in favor of a Pakistani nuclear explosive program, and I<br />
     don't think they are doing anything to help it,&quot; a top State Department<br />
     official reported in a secret briefing in 1979, three years after the<br />
     Bhutto-Mao deal was struck. A secret State Department report in 1983<br />
     said Washington was aware that Pakistan had requested China's help, but<br />
     &quot;we do not know what the present status of the cooperation is,&quot;<br />
     according to a declassified copy.<br />
<br />
     Meanwhile, Chinese Premier Zhao Ziyang promised at a White House dinner<br />
     in January 1984: &quot;We do not engage in nuclear proliferation ourselves,<br />
     nor do we help other countries develop nuclear weapons.&quot; A nearly<br />
     identical statement was made by China in a major summary of its<br />
     nonproliferation policies in 2003 and on many occasions in between.<br />
<br />
     Fred McGoldrick, a senior State Department nonproliferation official in<br />
     the Reagan and Clinton administrations, recalls that the United States<br />
     learned in the 1980s about the Chinese bomb-design and uranium<br />
     transfers. &quot;We did confront them, and they denied it,&quot; he said. Since<br />
     then, the connection has been confirmed by particles on nuclear-related<br />
     materials from Pakistan, many of which have characteristic Chinese bomb<br />
     program &quot;signatures,&quot; other officials say.<br />
<br />
     Hans M. Kristensen, director of the Nuclear Information Project at the<br />
     Federation of American Scientists, said that except for the instance<br />
     described by Khan, &quot;we are not aware of cases where a nuclear weapon<br />
     state has transferred HEU to a non-nuclear country for military use.&quot;<br />
     McGoldrick also said he is aware of &quot;nothing like it&quot; in the history of<br />
     nuclear weapons proliferation. But he said nothing has ever been said<br />
     publicly because &quot;this is diplomacy; you don't do that sort of thing . .<br />
     . if you want them to change their behavior.&quot;<br />
