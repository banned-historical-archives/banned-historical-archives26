		<h3>Tor</h3>
		<p><a href="https://www.torproject.org">Tor</a> is an encrypted anonymising network that makes it harder to intercept internet communications, or see where communications are coming from or going to.</p>
		<p>In order to use the WikiLeaks public submission system as detailed above you can download the Tor Browser Bundle, which is a Firefox-like browser available for Windows, Mac OS X and GNU/Linux and pre-configured to connect using the anonymising system Tor.</p>
		<h4>Tails</h4>
		<p>If you are at high risk and you have the capacity to do so, you can also access the submission system through a secure operating system called <a href="https://tails.boum.org">Tails</a>. Tails is an operating system launched from a USB stick or a DVD that aim to leaves no traces when the computer is shut down after use and automatically routes your internet traffic through Tor. Tails will require you to have either a USB stick or a DVD at least 4GB big and a laptop or desktop computer.</p>

		<h3>Tips</h3>
		<p>Our submission system works hard to preserve your anonymity, but we recommend you also take some of your own precautions. Please review these basic guidelines. </p>
		<div>
			<h4>1. Contact us if you have specific problems</h4>
			<p>If you have a very large submission, or a submission with a complex format, or are a high-risk source, please <a href="#submit_help_contact">contact us</a>. In our experience it is always possible to find a custom solution for even the most seemingly difficult situations.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h4>2. What computer to use</h4>
			<p>If the computer you are uploading from could subsequently be audited in an investigation, consider using a computer that is not easily tied to you. Technical users can also use <a href="https://tails.boum.org">Tails</a> to help ensure you do not leave any records of your submission on the computer.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h4>3. Do not talk about your submission to others</h4>
			<p>If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in source protection – it is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This includes other media organisations.</p>
		</div>

	</div>

		<h3>After</h3>

		<div>
			<h4>1. Do not talk about your submission to others</h4>
			<p>If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in source protection – it is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This includes other media organisations.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h4>2. Act normal</h4>
			<p>If you are a high-risk source, avoid saying anything or doing anything after submitting which might promote suspicion. In particular, you should try to stick to your normal routine and behaviour.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h4>3. Remove traces of your submission</h4>
			<p>If you are a high-risk source and the computer you prepared your submission on, or uploaded it from, could subsequently be audited in an investigation, we recommend that you format and dispose of the computer hard drive and any other storage media you used.</p>
			<p>In particular, hard drives retain data after formatting which may be visible to a digital forensics team and flash media (USB sticks, memory cards and SSD drives) retain data even after a secure erasure. If you used flash media to store sensitive data, it is important to destroy the media.</p>
			<p>If you do this and are a high-risk source you should make sure there are no traces of the clean-up, since such traces themselves may draw suspicion.</p>
			<div>
				<h4>4. If you face legal action</h4>
				<p>If a legal action is brought against you as a result of your submission, there are organisations that may help you. The Courage Foundation is an international organisation dedicated to the protection of journalistic sources. You can find more details at <a href="https://www.couragefound.org">https://www.couragefound.org</a>.</p>

		<p>WikiLeaks publishes documents of political or historical importance that are censored or otherwise suppressed. We specialise in strategic global publishing and large archives.</p>
		<p>The following is the address of our secure site where you can anonymously upload your documents to WikiLeaks editors. You can only access this submissions system through Tor. (See our <a href="#submit_help_tor">Tor tab</a> for more information.) We also advise you to read our <a href="#submit_help_tips">tips for sources</a> before submitting.</p>

			<!--<div>
				Copy this address into your Tor browser. Advanced users, if they wish, can also add a further layer of encryption to their submission using <a href="#submit_wlkey">our public PGP key</a>.
			</div>-->
		</div>

		<p>If you cannot use Tor, or your submission is very large, or you have specific requirements, WikiLeaks provides several alternative methods. <a href="#submit_help_contact">Contact us</a> to discuss how to proceed.</p>

SUN'S CORDDRY SAYS INFORMED SOURCES REVEALED THAT US
SR-71S HAVE BEEN CONDUCTING RECON FLIGHTS OVER NVN FOR
MANY MONTHS TO CHECK ON MIL MOVEMENTS AND TO &quot;MAKE
SURE HANOI KNOWS IT IS DOING SO.&quot;  SINCE OBLIQUE

PHOTOGRAPHY COULD ENABLE PLANES TO DO ALMOST AS WELL
OPERATING OFF COAST, SOURCES SEE FLIGHTS OVER DRV AS
POLITICAL RESPONSE TO HANOI'S ALLEGEDLY REPEATED C-F
VIOLATIONS AS WELL AS INTELLIGENCE GATHERING MISSIONS.
SPY FLIGHTS REPORTEDLY WERE IN PROGRESS LONG BEFORE
NVN'S RECENT COMPLAINTS ABOUT THEM.  NEITHER DOS NOR
DOD WOULD COMMENT ON FLIGHTS, UNDERSTOOD TO HAVE BEEN
AVERAGING TWO A MONTH.  CORDDRY REPORTS THAT PLANES
FLY FROM KADENA AIR BASE ON OKINAWA, PASS OVER NVN AT
ALTITUDE OF 80,000 FEET AND AT SPEED OF UP TO 2000 MPH,
WITHOUT CONCERN FOR NVN AIR DEFENSES.

ARTICLE IN NHAN DAN REFERRED TO RECENT DOS NOTE AND
STATEMENTS BY SECDEF AND STATE'S ANDERSON; DESCRIBED
NOTE AS &quot;TISSUE OF LIES&quot; AND PRESENTED LONG LIST OF
ALLEGED US AND SVN C-F VIOLATIONS.  NVN SAID      FORD

ADMIN HAS PROVED ITSELF    EQUAL OF NIXON GOVT IN
&quot;DISTORTING FACTS&quot; ABOUT US INVOLVEMENT IN VN.  IN
MOSCOW, PRAVDA COMMENTED THAT US IS NOT FULFILLING
C-F BANS ON INTRODUCTION OF ARMS INTO SVN.  ADDED
DOD HAS DELIVERED TO THIEU 1100 TANKS AND APCS, 800
GUNS, 700 PLANES AND 200 WARSHIPS, AND THAT ABOUT
25,000 US SPECIALISTS      STILL IN SAIGON AREA (AP, SUN).

IN STOCKHOLM FONMIN SAID      SWEDEN HAD FORMALLY
BROKEN OFF RELATIONS WITH SVN (CHITRIB).

WP'S SCOTT QUOTES SEN MCGOVERN THAT MORE MIL AID TO
SVN WILL ONLY FURTHER ERODE C-F, NOT HELP IT BECOME
REALITY, AND THAT HE IS &quot;ASTONISHED&quot; AT REPORTS
ADMIN PLANS TO ASK FOR SUPPLEMENTAL.  SAYS SEN ADMITS
THAT THERE MAY HAVE BEEN VIOLATIONS ON BOTH SIDES BUT
&quot;OUR OBLIGATION IS NOT TO AN ALLY ... BUT TO AGREEMENT
ITSELF&quot; AND SUPPORT FOR ONE SIDE ENCOURAGES IT TO GO
FOR MIL SETTLEMENT AND RESIST POLITICAL SETTLEMENT.
MCGOVERN ALSO VOICED ASTONISHMENT THAT US PLANES
FLY OVER NVN AND SVN, COUPLED WITH CLAIMS OF &quot;OUR
RIGHT TO BREAK THE PEACE AGREEMENT.&quot;  TOLD NEWS
CONFERENCE      WE HAVE ENDURED &quot;JOHNSON'S WAR AND
NIXON'S WAR; ...WE DO NOT WANT TO ENDURE FORD'S WAR,

TOO.&quot;  CONFERENCE WAS HELD TO ANNOUNCE      500
RELIGIOUS, LABOR, SOCIAL ACTION AND PEACE LEADERS
WILL MEET IN WASHINGTON JAN 25-27 FOR &quot;ASSEMBLY TO
SAVE THE PEACE AGREEMENT,&quot; THAT WILL INCLUDE
CANDLELIGHT WALK TO WH TO PROTEST FORD'S INDOCHINA
POLICY.  GLOBE QUOTES MCGOVERN THAT &quot;VAST WEIGHT OF
THE EVIDENCE&quot; IS THAT NVN AND PRG SUPPORT C-F, BUT
THIEU DOES NOT, AND THAT HE SEES ASSEMBLY AS IMPORTANT
STEP TO HELP GUARANTEE THAT WAR WILL END.

VC GUNNERS HIT SVN'S BIGGEST MIL TRAINING CENTER IN
SUBURBAN SAIGON AND KILL FOUR.  OTHER ROCKETS LAND
IN SURROUNDING VILLAGES AND KILL TWO (AP BALTO N-A
1/16; NYT; WP).  MIL SOURCES SAID VNAF KNOCKED OUT
HALF OF NVN 150-TRUCK CONVOY IN HIGHLANDS IN THIRD
SUCH STRIKE THIS WEEK.

NYT'S MARKHAM IN BIEN HOA REPORTS THAT NOCTURNAL
ROCKETING OF CITY IS ONE ELEMENT OF SUDDENLY STEPPED-
UP CAMPAIGN OF SABOTAGE, TERRORISM AND ASSASSINATION
BY VC AROUND SAIGON.

SAYS THAT TO SOME FOREIGNERS AND VIETS IT COMES AS
SURPRISE THAT VC CAN ACT WITH IMPUNITY ON EDGES OF
CAPITAL, BUT GUERRILLAS HAVE &quot;ALWAYS BEEN THERE.&quot;

MIL ANALYSTS BELIEVE COMMUNISTS WANT TO AVOID HEADLINE-
GRABBING EXPLOITS IN SAIGON IN FAVOR OF ACTIONS THAT
GRADUALLY AND UNDRAMATICALLY UNDERMINE GVN, SINCE THEY
MAY WANT TO AVOID GIVING     WORLD IMPRESSION
THEY HAVE SCRAPPED C-F.  ADDS THAT VIRTUALLY ALL
MIL UNITS IN AREA HAVE BEEN ON ALERT FOR THREE MONTHS,
AND SWEEPS ARE MADE NEARBY.

LAOTIAN PEACE COMMITTEE REPORTS      MISSING AMERICAN
CHARLES DEAN WAS RECENTLY SEEN FREELY MIXING WITH PL
TROOPS IN ISOLATED VILLAGE OVER 200 MILES SOUTH OF
WHERE HE WAS CAPTURED (AP, NYT).

DOD SPOKESMAN SAID US ARMY CORPORAL MCKINLEY NOLAN,
WHO DESERTED SEVEN YEARS AGO IN VN, WAS SEEN ALIVE
UNCLASSIFIED

UNCLASSIFIED

PAGE 04  STATE  012585

IN CAMBODIA.  THERE ARE SUSPICIONS NOLAN IS DEFECTOR
COLLABORATING WITH COMMUNISTS.  DOD DECLINED TO DISCUSS
ORIGIN OF INFO, BUT SAID SOURCE WAS CONSIDERED RELIABLE
(UPI, WP).

REBELS FIRED EIGHT ROCKETS AT POCHENTONG BUT HIT
HOUSING COMPOUND OUTSIDE, ACCORDING MIL SOURCES
(WP).  WP'S FENTON IN PP FINDS CITY CASUAL AS
PRESSURE RISES.  QUOTES EXPERIENCED OBSERVER THAT
SITUATION IS MOST SERIOUS HE HAD EVER SEEN, AND
WAR CAN ONLY BE WON BY TAKING BIG RISK.  OBSERVER
SAID      GKR SHOULD COMMIT FULL DIVISION TO REOPENING
ROUTE 1 AND MEKONG.  BELIEVES TROUBLE MAY BE THAT
EITHER GKR DOES NOT HAVE ENOUGH FORCES FOR SUCH
OPERATION OR LACKS TRANSPORT TO GATHER THEM QUICKLY
FROM COMPARATIVELY QUIET PROVINCE CAPITALS.  OBSERVES
THAT ELITE TROOPS THAT TRADITIONALLY HAVE BORNE
BRUNT OF FIGHTING ARE NOW SCATTERED AND TIED DOWN.
SAYS US EMBASSY BELIEVED TO WANT TO GET MEKONG CONVOY
THROUGH EVEN AT RISK OF LOSSES.  NOTES ESTIMATES OF
PP'S RESERVES VARY, AND THAT IN OPINION OF NON-US
DIPLOMATIC SOURCES AIRLIFT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE DUE TO
SIZE OF AIRPORT AND LACK OF PERSONNEL CAPABLE OF HANDLING
&quot;COLOSSAL&quot; OPERATION.

NYT'S SCHANBERG IN PP QUOTES US EMBASSY THAT CONTINGENCY
PLAN EXISTS TO RUN LARGE SUPPLY AIRLIFT INTO CAMBODIA
TO KEEP GKR FROM FALLING, BUT IT WOULD BE DONE ONLY AS
LAST RESORT, AND WAS NOT BEING CONSIDERED RIGHT NOW.
NOTES NO MEKONG CONVOY HAS COME IN SINCE INSURGENTS
STARTED NEW YEAR'S DAY OFFENSIVE AND CITY IS STARTING
TO RUN SHORT OF BASICS.  BELIEVES GKR MUST DO SOMETHING
SOON OR US WILL HAVE TO CONSIDER FULL AIRLIFT.  RECOUNTS

THAT LAST OCT EMBASSY TURNED OVER AIR-SUPPLY DUTIES
TO &quot;SO-CALLED&quot; CIVILIAN CONTRACTOR BIRD AIR, TO GET
USAF OUT OF IT IN RESPONSE TO GROWING POLITICAL HOSTILITY
AT HOME TO CONTINUED AMERICAN INVOLVEMENT.  SAYS MOVE

ACCORDING FRG DIPLOMATS, STRAUSS HAD PROMISED NOT

COMMENT AND ANALYSIS

9.  INDOCHINA

S-N'S NOYES SEES NEW OFFENSIVE AND URGENT ADMIN PLEA
FOR MORE MIL AID FUNDS REVIVING ALL THE OLD PASSIONS
WITH A VENGEANCE, AND IT IS OBVIOUS THAT &quot;TRYING TO
EXTRACT ONE RED CENT FROM THIS SO-CALLED LIBERAL

CONGRESS&quot; IS   MONUMENTAL TASK (JAN I6).

OLD ARGUMENTS TAKE ON NEW INTENSITY AS OPPOSITION
SNIFFS &quot;HEADY SENSE OF FINAL DEFEAT&quot; AND THERE IS
INCREDIBLE AMOUNT OF MEALY-MOUTHED HYPOCRISY IN ARGUMENTS
WHY US HAS MORAL OBLIGATION TO DO NO MORE TO HELP SVN.
LIBERALS EXPLAIN ALL WOULD BE WELL IF ONLY SAIGON
WOULD LIVE UP TO C-F NEGOTIATED BY HAK, COME TO TERMS
WITH ENEMIES.

SEN. MANSFIELD IS FOUR-SQUARE AGAINST ANY FUTURE AID
&quot;TO STOP THE KILLING,&quot; SEN CHURCH ARGUES PASSIONATELY
THAT WAR WOULD HAVE ENDED LONG AGO, &quot;EXCEPT FOR
OUTSIDE INTERFERENCE&quot;.

NOYES SUGGESTS THESE &quot;COMPASSIONATE GENTLEMEN&quot; KNOW
THAT THERE IS NO CHANCE FOR COMPROMISE PEACE; THAT
DRV WILL CONTINUE TO GET UNLIMITED BACKING OF SOVIETS
AND CHINESE; AND THAT WITHDRAWAL OF US AID MEANS
MILITARY SUBJUGATION OF 15 MILLION PEOPLE WHO HAVE
DEFENDED THEMSELVES FOR 30 YEARS.  WHY NOT SAY SO
IN SO MANY WORDS?

SEN. MCGOVERN HAS VIRTUE OF CERTAIN HARSH HONESTY
IN NOT PRETENDING WE ARE BETRAYING ALLIES OUT OF
A HUMANITARIAN CONCERN FOR THEIR OWN BEST INTERESTS.
HIS PREDICTION THAT EARLY COLLAPSE &quot;IS JUST A MATTER
OF TIME&quot; ONCE US PULLS OUT IS CLOSE TO SELF-FULFILLING
PROPHECY.    MESSAGE IS CLEAR TO VIETNAMESE AND OTHERS:
SO FAR AS LIBERAL CONGRESS IS CONCERNED &quot;WE NO LONGER
GIVE A DAMN WHAT HAPPENS IN THE REST OF THE WORLD.&quot;
AS MCGOVERN SUGGESTS, &quot;IT IS JUST MATTER OF TIME.&quot;

ROTH (BULLETIN 1/14) SAYS THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT
IF US PROVIDES GVN MORE MONEY, COMMUNISTS WILL NOT
PREVAIL ANYHOW.  BELIEVE CONGRESS MUST ASK ITSELF
WHETHER IN INTEREST OF US TO CONTINUE INDEFINITELY
INVOLVEMENT IN WAR FOR WHICH NO END IN SIGHT.
NOTES THAT SOME CONTEND DECISION CANNOT BE REACHED
ON THAT BASIS ONLY, SINCE MORAL CONSIDERATIONS
CANNOT BE IGNORED: HAS US RIGHT TO ABANDON ALLY,
AND HAVE THOSE WHO FOUGHT AND DIED THERE DONE IT
FOR NOTHING?

ADMITS QUESTIONS ARE DIFFICULT TO ANSWER, AS ARE
QUESTIONS ON OTHER SIDE: WHEN WILL OUR OBLIGATION
TO SVN BE FULLY MET, AND HOW LONG SHOULD WE GO ON
SUPPORTING WAR THAT MAKES NO DISTINCTION BETWEEN

COMBATANTS AND CIVILIANS THAT NO ONE IN ANY REAL
SENSE CAN WIN?  BELIEVES NEW CONGRESS MAY FACE

QUESTIONS MORE SQUARELY, BUT IT CHANGES MORE SLOWLY
THAN ITS PERSONNEL AND POSITIONS TAKEN ARE NOT
QUICKLY OR EASILY ABANDONED.  SEES IT NOT UNLIKELY
THAT COMPROMISE ROUTE WILL BE FOLLOWED THAT WOULD
MEAN VOTING SOME OF EXTRA VN AID MONEY TO KEEP THIEU
GOING BUT NOT FOR LONG: ENOUGH TO STAVE OFF DEFEAT
BUT NOT ENOUGH TO BRING VICTORY.  OPINES THAT BASIC
QUESTIONS WILL STAY UNANSWERED AND WAR WILL GO ON.

BOSTON GLOBE WONDERS WHEN WE WILL EVER LEARN.  SAYS
C-F UNDERMINED BY SIGNERS AND US MUST SHARE GUILT.
NOTES THAT NONE OF PARTIES HAS WORKED TOWARD NATIONAL
RECONCILIATION, BUT THERE IS EVIDENCE THAT BLAME
FOR BREAKING TRUCE INITIALLY RESTS WITH THIEU.  QUOTES
MAYNARD PARKER IN CURRENT FOREIGN AFFAIRS THAT GVN
TOOK OFFENSIVE ALMOST FROM MOMENT C-F WAS SIGNED.
SAYS CONTINUED US MIL AID VIOLATES SPIRIT OF C-F
AND PROLONGS WAR.  MENTIONS RECON FLIGHTS OVER NVN AS
PERHAPS VIOLATING LETTER OF ACCORDS; AND CONTENDS
ARGUMENT THAT VIOLATED PACT IS NO PACT AT ALL, IF
CARRIED TO ITS CONCLUSION, WOULD ALLOW RENEWED US

CONGRESSIONAL BAN ARE LIMITED, BUT RECOURSE TO
OVERFLIGHTS OF NVN COULD HAVE DISASTROUS CONSEQUENCES.
PAST HISTORY SUGGESTS NORTH VIETS LIKELY TO FIRE AT
PLANES, AND IF US PILOTS ARE LOST ADMIN MAY AGAIN
INVOKE NEED TO PROTECT US LIVES.  SAME DANGER APPLIES
TO FLIGHTS OVER COMMUNIST AREAS OF SVN.  INSISTS
RECON ACTIVITY OVER NVN IS C-F VIOLATION.
SAYS PRACTICAL QUESTION IS NOT WHETHER US HAS RIGHT
TO FLY OVER NVN, BUT WHETHER THIS IS WISE COURSE
OF ACTION, SINCE MAJOR RISKS  BEING TAKEN.  ADMIN
IS CONCERNED ABOUT SITUATION AND PREPARED TO PULL
OUT ALL STOPS WITHIN LAW, GO TO CONGRESS FOR MORE
FUNDS, AND FEELS PRESSED TO WARN HANOI TO STAY
WITHIN ACCEPTABLE BOUNDS UNLESS IT WISHES TO TRIGGER
MAJOR CRISIS.  BELIEVES RECON FLIGHTS TAKE MATTER
STEP FURTHER, BUT THIS IS HIGHLY DANGEROUS WAY OF
DEALING WITH VN SITUATION.  &quot;HISTORY SHOULD HAVE
TAUGHT US THIS LESSON.&quot;

SHIPLER (NYT) IN SAIGON SEES INFLUENCE OF C-F ACCORDS
WANING AS PACE OF CONFLICT INCREASES.  WAR BEING
FOUGHT AT TEMPO OF EARLY DAYS OF US INVOLVEMENT.
AGREEMENTS CALL FOR DEMOCRATIC LIBERTIES AND OPEN
POLITICAL STRUGGLE BETWEEN BOTH SIDES, BUT GVN HAS
CONTINUED TO EXCLUDE COMMUNISTS FROM ANY LEGAL ROLE,
WHILE COMMUNISTS HAVE REFUSED TO NEGOTIATE WITH THIEU.
SOME BELIEVE C-F STILL IMPOSES MEASURE OF MIL
INHIBITION ON COMBATANTS, BUT OTHERS SEE RESTRAINTS
ERODING BADLY.  SPECULATION IN SAIGON IS THAT COMBAT
MAY BRING CONFLICT TO SOME FRESH TURNING POINT AND
NEW NEGOTIATIONS MAY EMERGE.  DIPLOMATS THEORIZE
THAT THIEU MAY OFFER TO CARRY OUT PARTS OF C-F THAT
COMMUNISTS CONSIDER FAVORABLE TO THEIR SIDE, BUT
NO HARD EVIDENCE THIS WILL HAPPEN.

SHIPLER REVIEWS EVENTS IN SVN THAT PRECEDED C-F,
INCLUDING ARMS BUILD-UPS AND LAND-GRABBING, AND
HAPPENINGS SINCE.  SAYS VC ORDER OF OCT 15, 1973

UNITS TO FIGHT BACK AGAINST GVN TO COMPEL IT TO
IMPLEMENT C-F.  WITH INCREASED COMMUNIST ATTACKS

AND US MIL AID CUTS, SVN FORCES' DOWNWARD SLIDE
STARTED.  WITH RECENT DEFEAT, THERE IS PERVASIVE
FEELING THAT BALANCE OF MIL POWER IS TIPPING
TOWARD COMMUNISTS.  MIL ANALYSTS NOW EXPECT
INTENSIFIED NVA CAMPAIGN TO GRAB MIL POSITIONS AND
OBLITERATE GVN-CONTROLLED POCKETS WHILE INFLICTING
MAXIMUM CASUALTIES ON ARVN.  THIS REGARDED AS
SOPHISTICATED PSYCHOLOGICAL, MIL AND POLITICAL
GAME TO ERODE GVN BASE BY UNDERMINING MORALE IN
ARMY AND CALLING THIEU'S JUDGMENT INTO QUESTION.

SHIPLER NOTES REPORTS THAT SOME GENERALS DISAGREE
WITH ATTEMPTS TO HOLD ISOLATED POSTS LIKE PHUOC BINH
AT TIME DWINDLING US AID.  EFFECTS OF AID CUTS ARE
WIDELY DEBATED IN SAIGON WITH SOME

ARGUING THAT ONLY WASTE WAS ELIMINATED BY REDUCTIONS.
OBSERVES THAT CUTS DAMAGED TROOPS' MORALE.  SEES
CONFLICT STILL GOVERNED BY UNSWERVING DEVOTION OF
NORTH AND VC TO REUNIFY COUNTRY.  SPECULATION EXISTS
THAT HANOI EXPECTED US PRESSURE ON THIEU TO ADHERE
TO C-F AND DWINDLING AID TO WEAKEN AND TOPPLE GVN.
THIS DID NOT HAPPEN, SO COMMUNISTS APPEAR TO HAVE
TURNED CLOCK BACK.

OUTCOME REMAINS UNPREDICTABLE, WITH ECON WOES POSSIBLY
BEING TRANSLATED INTO POLITICAL UNREST OR MIL APATHY.
BEYOND QUESTIONS OF POSSIBLE INTERNAL OPPOSITION
AND REACTION IN US, CHINA AND SOVIET, LIE SUBTLE
POINTS OF POWER AND POLITICS.  SHIPLER QUOTES SVN
OFFICIAL THAT GOAL IS TO GAIN RESPECT FROM COMMUNISTS,
TO RID THEM OF IDEA THAT SOUTH VIETS ARE PUPPETS;
MIL AID CUTS WILL RESOLVE NOTHING, SINCE THIS IS
&quot;TOTAL WAR IN EVERY SENSE.&quot;

FEELS IMPLICATIONS OF CHINA'S EMERGENCE AS MAJOR OIL
POWER ARE AS INTRIGUING AS THEY ARE CONJECTURAL.
SEES SIGNALS -- ESPECIALLY JAPAN'S PULLING BACK FROM
OIL/GAS PROJECT IN SOVIET SIBERIA -- THAT PEKING
IS QUITE PREPARED TO DEPLOY ITS OWN OIL WEAPONS TO
SUPPORT OF ITS STRATEGIC AND DIPLOMATIC INTERESTS.
CITES VIEW OF SOME US SOURCES THAT PEKING'S DEALINGS
WITH JAPAN &quot;PAID OFF&quot; BY DEFLECTING MOSCOW-TOKYO
SIBERIA DEAL, AND THAT CHINA'S OFFER OF CRUDE OIL TO
FRG AND AUSTRALIA DISPLAYS AWARENESS THAT HER SUPPORT
OF ARAB &quot;OIL WEAPON&quot; HARMS SUPERPOWERS LESS THAN WE
COMMUNITY.

SUN SAYS MUCH OF CHINESE DECISION WHETHER TO SELL US
OIL IN QUANTITY AND BUY OUR OIL-DRILLING TECHNOLOGY
MAY DEPEND ON SPEED WITH WHICH US NORMALIZES RELATIONS
AND TERMS BY WHICH US FIRMS WILL WANT TO TRADE WITH
CHINA.  BUT IT IS APPARENT THAT EMERGENCE OF ANOTHER
MAJOR OIL EXPORTER ON WORLD MARKET IS BOUND TO
BRIGHTEN GENERAL SUPPLY PICTURE AND EASE SOME OF
PRESSURES ON LARGE CONSUMERS.  SINCE US, JAPAN AND
WE SHARE SOME OF PEKING'S TREPIDATIONS ABOUT SOVIET,
IT IS REASSURING THAT CHINESE OIL MAY BE LIGHTING LOT
WORLD'S LAMPS.

PHINQ'S POTHIER REPORTS CONCLUSIONS OF PHILA CHILD
PSYCHIATRIST DR. THEODORE COHEN, WHO RETURNED FROM
CHINA STUDY TRIP FEW MONTHS AGO, THAT CONTRARY TO
VIEW OF MOST AMERICANS, CHINA ACTUALLY TREATS ITS
CHILDREN WITH &quot;WARM, CONSISTENT GENTLENESS&quot; -- AND
THAT AMERICA MIGHT DO WELL TO ADOPT SOME, BUT NOT ALL,
OF SUCCESSFUL PRC CHILD-REARING PRACTICES.  COHEN
FOUND THAT CHINA HAS SOMEHOW CREATED ENVIRONMENT
IN WHICH CHILD ABUSE IS UNHEARD-OF, WITH CHILDREN
UNIVERSALLY WELL-FED, SMILING AND HAPPY AND PROBLEMS
SUCH AS DRUG ABUSE AND DELINQUENCY NON-EXISTENT.
BUT CHINESE SOCIETY PAY OBVIOUS PRICE FOR THIS
ENVIRONMENT IN TERMS DE- EMPHASIS ON INDIVIDUALITY,
CREATIVITY AND CURIOSITY -- IN BOTH CHILDREN AND
ADULTS.

THE EVIDENCE&quot; IS THAT NVN AND PRG SUPPORT C-F, BUT
THIEU DOES NOT, AND THAT HE SEES ASSEMBLY AS IMPORTANT
STEP TO HELP GUARANTEE THAT WAR WILL END.

VC GUNNERS HIT SVN'S BIGGEST MIL TRAINING CENTER IN
SUBURBAN SAIGON AND KILL FOUR.  OTHER ROCKETS LAND
IN SURROUNDING VILLAGES AND KILL TWO (AP BALTO N-A
1/16; NYT; WP).  MIL SOURCES SAID VNAF KNOCKED OUT
HALF OF NVN 150-TRUCK CONVOY IN HIGHLANDS IN THIRD
SUCH STRIKE THIS WEEK.

NYT'S MARKHAM IN BIEN HOA REPORTS THAT NOCTURNAL
ROCKETING OF CITY IS ONE ELEMENT OF SUDDENLY STEPPED-
UP CAMPAIGN OF SABOTAGE, TERRORISM AND ASSASSINATION
BY VC AROUND SAIGON.

SAYS THAT TO SOME FOREIGNERS AND VIETS IT COMES AS
SURPRISE THAT VC CAN ACT WITH IMPUNITY ON EDGES OF
CAPITAL, BUT GUERRILLAS HAVE &quot;ALWAYS BEEN THERE.&quot;

MIL ANALYSTS BELIEVE COMMUNISTS WANT TO AVOID HEADLINE-
GRABBING EXPLOITS IN SAIGON IN FAVOR OF ACTIONS THAT
GRADUALLY AND UNDRAMATICALLY UNDERMINE GVN, SINCE THEY
MAY WANT TO AVOID GIVING     WORLD IMPRESSION
THEY HAVE SCRAPPED C-F.  ADDS THAT VIRTUALLY ALL
MIL UNITS IN AREA HAVE BEEN ON ALERT FOR THREE MONTHS,
AND SWEEPS ARE MADE NEARBY.

(WP).  WP'S FENTON IN PP FINDS CITY CASUAL AS
PRESSURE RISES.  QUOTES EXPERIENCED OBSERVER THAT
SITUATION IS MOST SERIOUS HE HAD EVER SEEN, AND
WAR CAN ONLY BE WON BY TAKING BIG RISK.  OBSERVER
SAID      GKR SHOULD COMMIT FULL DIVISION TO REOPENING
ROUTE 1 AND MEKONG.  BELIEVES TROUBLE MAY BE THAT
EITHER GKR DOES NOT HAVE ENOUGH FORCES FOR SUCH
OPERATION OR LACKS TRANSPORT TO GATHER THEM QUICKLY
FROM COMPARATIVELY QUIET PROVINCE CAPITALS.  OBSERVES
THAT ELITE TROOPS THAT TRADITIONALLY HAVE BORNE
BRUNT OF FIGHTING ARE NOW SCATTERED AND TIED DOWN.
SAYS US EMBASSY BELIEVED TO WANT TO GET MEKONG CONVOY
THROUGH EVEN AT RISK OF LOSSES.  NOTES ESTIMATES OF
PP'S RESERVES VARY, AND THAT IN OPINION OF NON-US
DIPLOMATIC SOURCES AIRLIFT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE DUE TO
SIZE OF AIRPORT AND LACK OF PERSONNEL CAPABLE OF HANDLING
&quot;COLOSSAL&quot; OPERATION.

NYT'S SCHANBERG IN PP QUOTES US EMBASSY THAT CONTINGENCY
PLAN EXISTS TO RUN LARGE SUPPLY AIRLIFT INTO CAMBODIA
TO KEEP GKR FROM FALLING, BUT IT WOULD BE DONE ONLY AS
LAST RESORT, AND WAS NOT BEING CONSIDERED RIGHT NOW.
NOTES NO MEKONG CONVOY HAS COME IN SINCE INSURGENTS
STARTED NEW YEAR'S DAY OFFENSIVE AND CITY IS STARTING
TO RUN SHORT OF BASICS.  BELIEVES GKR MUST DO SOMETHING
SOON OR US WILL HAVE TO CONSIDER FULL AIRLIFT.  RECOUNTS

USAF OUT OF IT IN RESPONSE TO GROWING POLITICAL HOSTILITY

C-130S, AND CAN OPERATE MAXIMUM OF TEN FLIGHTS DAILY
BRINGING IN 200 TONS OF SUPPLIES.  SAYS THIS IS ONE-
TENTH OF PP'S NEEDS, SINCE AMMO IS BEING EXPENDED AT 600
TONS DAILY, AND 600 TONS OF RICE NEEDED PER DAY FOR
PP, NOT TO MENTION MEDICINE, FUEL, PARTS AND OTHER
SUPPLIES.  RECALLS      IN 1973, WHEN MEKONG, WAS UNDER
FIRE, USAF BROUGHT IN 40-50 TRANSPORTS DAILY.  EMBASSY
SPOKESMAN SAID PRESENT PLAN IS TO USE BIRD AIR TO MAXIMUM
UNTIL GKR TROOPS OPEN   ENOUGH OF MEKONG TO LET SOME
CONVOYS THROUGH.  OPINES THAT EMBASSY GIVES IMPRESSION

ALL STEPS NECESSARY TO DO THIS - EVEN IF IT NECESSITATES

COMMENT AND ANALYSIS

9.  INDOCHINA

S-N'S NOYES SEES NEW OFFENSIVE AND URGENT ADMIN PLEA
FOR MORE MIL AID FUNDS REVIVING ALL THE OLD PASSIONS
WITH A VENGEANCE, AND IT IS OBVIOUS THAT &quot;TRYING TO
EXTRACT ONE RED CENT FROM THIS SO-CALLED LIBERAL

CONGRESS&quot; IS   MONUMENTAL TASK (JAN I6).

OLD ARGUMENTS TAKE ON NEW INTENSITY AS OPPOSITION
SNIFFS &quot;HEADY SENSE OF FINAL DEFEAT&quot; AND THERE IS
INCREDIBLE AMOUNT OF MEALY-MOUTHED HYPOCRISY IN ARGUMENTS
WHY US HAS MORAL OBLIGATION TO DO NO MORE TO HELP SVN.
LIBERALS EXPLAIN ALL WOULD BE WELL IF ONLY SAIGON
WOULD LIVE UP TO C-F NEGOTIATED BY HAK, COME TO TERMS
WITH ENEMIES.

SEN. MANSFIELD IS FOUR-SQUARE AGAINST ANY FUTURE AID
&quot;TO STOP THE KILLING,&quot; SEN CHURCH ARGUES PASSIONATELY
THAT WAR WOULD HAVE ENDED LONG AGO, &quot;EXCEPT FOR
OUTSIDE INTERFERENCE&quot;.

NOYES SUGGESTS THESE &quot;COMPASSIONATE GENTLEMEN&quot; KNOW
THAT THERE IS NO CHANCE FOR COMPROMISE PEACE; THAT
DRV WILL CONTINUE TO GET UNLIMITED BACKING OF SOVIETS
AND CHINESE; AND THAT WITHDRAWAL OF US AID MEANS
MILITARY SUBJUGATION OF 15 MILLION PEOPLE WHO HAVE
DEFENDED THEMSELVES FOR 30 YEARS.  WHY NOT SAY SO
IN SO MANY WORDS?

SEN. MCGOVERN HAS VIRTUE OF CERTAIN HARSH HONESTY
IN NOT PRETENDING WE ARE BETRAYING ALLIES OUT OF
A HUMANITARIAN CONCERN FOR THEIR OWN BEST INTERESTS.
HIS PREDICTION THAT EARLY COLLAPSE &quot;IS JUST A MATTER
OF TIME&quot; ONCE US PULLS OUT IS CLOSE TO SELF-FULFILLING
PROPHECY.    MESSAGE IS CLEAR TO VIETNAMESE AND OTHERS:
SO FAR AS LIBERAL CONGRESS IS CONCERNED &quot;WE NO LONGER
GIVE A DAMN WHAT HAPPENS IN THE REST OF THE WORLD.&quot;
AS MCGOVERN SUGGESTS, &quot;IT IS JUST MATTER OF TIME.&quot;

ROTH (BULLETIN 1/14) SAYS THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT
IF US PROVIDES GVN MORE MONEY, COMMUNISTS WILL NOT
PREVAIL ANYHOW.  BELIEVE CONGRESS MUST ASK ITSELF
WHETHER IN INTEREST OF US TO CONTINUE INDEFINITELY
INVOLVEMENT IN WAR FOR WHICH NO END IN SIGHT.
NOTES THAT SOME CONTEND DECISION CANNOT BE REACHED
ON THAT BASIS ONLY, SINCE MORAL CONSIDERATIONS
CANNOT BE IGNORED: HAS US RIGHT TO ABANDON ALLY,
AND HAVE THOSE WHO FOUGHT AND DIED THERE DONE IT
FOR NOTHING?

ADMITS QUESTIONS ARE DIFFICULT TO ANSWER, AS ARE
QUESTIONS ON OTHER SIDE: WHEN WILL OUR OBLIGATION
TO SVN BE FULLY MET, AND HOW LONG SHOULD WE GO ON
SUPPORTING WAR THAT MAKES NO DISTINCTION BETWEEN

COMBATANTS AND CIVILIANS THAT NO ONE IN ANY REAL
SENSE CAN WIN?  BELIEVES NEW CONGRESS MAY FACE

QUESTIONS MORE SQUARELY, BUT IT CHANGES MORE SLOWLY
THAN ITS PERSONNEL AND POSITIONS TAKEN ARE NOT
QUICKLY OR EASILY ABANDONED.  SEES IT NOT UNLIKELY
THAT COMPROMISE ROUTE WILL BE FOLLOWED THAT WOULD
MEAN VOTING SOME OF EXTRA VN AID MONEY TO KEEP THIEU
GOING BUT NOT FOR LONG: ENOUGH TO STAVE OFF DEFEAT
BUT NOT ENOUGH TO BRING VICTORY.  OPINES THAT BASIC
QUESTIONS WILL STAY UNANSWERED AND WAR WILL GO ON.

BOSTON GLOBE WONDERS WHEN WE WILL EVER LEARN.  SAYS
C-F UNDERMINED BY SIGNERS AND US MUST SHARE GUILT.
NOTES THAT NONE OF PARTIES HAS WORKED TOWARD NATIONAL
RECONCILIATION, BUT THERE IS EVIDENCE THAT BLAME
FOR BREAKING TRUCE INITIALLY RESTS WITH THIEU.  QUOTES
MAYNARD PARKER IN CURRENT FOREIGN AFFAIRS THAT GVN
TOOK OFFENSIVE ALMOST FROM MOMENT C-F WAS SIGNED.
SAYS CONTINUED US MIL AID VIOLATES SPIRIT OF C-F
AND PROLONGS WAR.  MENTIONS RECON FLIGHTS OVER NVN AS
PERHAPS VIOLATING LETTER OF ACCORDS; AND CONTENDS
ARGUMENT THAT VIOLATED PACT IS NO PACT AT ALL, IF
CARRIED TO ITS CONCLUSION, WOULD ALLOW RENEWED US
BOMBING, OR WORSE.  STATES C-F DEFINES PROPER POSTURE
FOR US.  RAPS &quot;AUDACITY&quot; AND &quot;HYPOCRISY&quot; OF RECENT

ITS FIDELITY TO C-F, ORDER END TO US VIOLATIONS,

CONGRESSIONAL BAN ARE LIMITED, BUT RECOURSE TO

PAST HISTORY SUGGESTS NORTH VIETS LIKELY TO FIRE AT
PLANES, AND IF US PILOTS ARE LOST ADMIN MAY AGAIN
INVOKE NEED TO PROTECT US LIVES.  SAME DANGER APPLIES
TO FLIGHTS OVER COMMUNIST AREAS OF SVN.  INSISTS
RECON ACTIVITY OVER NVN IS C-F VIOLATION.
SAYS PRACTICAL QUESTION IS NOT WHETHER US HAS RIGHT
TO FLY OVER NVN, BUT WHETHER THIS IS WISE COURSE
OF ACTION, SINCE MAJOR RISKS  BEING TAKEN.  ADMIN
IS CONCERNED ABOUT SITUATION AND PREPARED TO PULL
OUT ALL STOPS WITHIN LAW, GO TO CONGRESS FOR MORE
FUNDS, AND FEELS PRESSED TO WARN HANOI TO STAY
WITHIN ACCEPTABLE BOUNDS UNLESS IT WISHES TO TRIGGER

SHIPLER (NYT) IN SAIGON SEES INFLUENCE OF C-F ACCORDS
WANING AS PACE OF CONFLICT INCREASES.  WAR BEING
FOUGHT AT TEMPO OF EARLY DAYS OF US INVOLVEMENT.
AGREEMENTS CALL FOR DEMOCRATIC LIBERTIES AND OPEN
POLITICAL STRUGGLE BETWEEN BOTH SIDES, BUT GVN HAS
CONTINUED TO EXCLUDE COMMUNISTS FROM ANY LEGAL ROLE,
WHILE COMMUNISTS HAVE REFUSED TO NEGOTIATE WITH THIEU.
SOME BELIEVE C-F STILL IMPOSES MEASURE OF MIL
INHIBITION ON COMBATANTS, BUT OTHERS SEE RESTRAINTS
ERODING BADLY.  SPECULATION IN SAIGON IS THAT COMBAT
MAY BRING CONFLICT TO SOME FRESH TURNING POINT AND
NEW NEGOTIATIONS MAY EMERGE.  DIPLOMATS THEORIZE
THAT THIEU MAY OFFER TO CARRY OUT PARTS OF C-F THAT
COMMUNISTS CONSIDER FAVORABLE TO THEIR SIDE, BUT
NO HARD EVIDENCE THIS WILL HAPPEN.

INCLUDING ARMS BUILD-UPS AND LAND-GRABBING, AND
HAPPENINGS SINCE.  SAYS VC ORDER OF OCT 15, 1973

AND US MIL AID CUTS, SVN FORCES' DOWNWARD SLIDE
STARTED.  WITH RECENT DEFEAT, THERE IS PERVASIVE
FEELING THAT BALANCE OF MIL POWER IS TIPPING
TOWARD COMMUNISTS.  MIL ANALYSTS NOW EXPECT
INTENSIFIED NVA CAMPAIGN TO GRAB MIL POSITIONS AND
OBLITERATE GVN-CONTROLLED POCKETS WHILE INFLICTING
MAXIMUM CASUALTIES ON ARVN.  THIS REGARDED AS
SOPHISTICATED PSYCHOLOGICAL, MIL AND POLITICAL
GAME TO ERODE GVN BASE BY UNDERMINING MORALE IN
ARMY AND CALLING THIEU'S JUDGMENT INTO QUESTION.

SHIPLER NOTES REPORTS THAT SOME GENERALS DISAGREE
WITH ATTEMPTS TO HOLD ISOLATED POSTS LIKE PHUOC BINH
AT TIME DWINDLING US AID.  EFFECTS OF AID CUTS ARE
WIDELY DEBATED IN SAIGON WITH SOME

ARGUING THAT ONLY WASTE WAS ELIMINATED BY REDUCTIONS.
OBSERVES THAT CUTS DAMAGED TROOPS' MORALE.  SEES
CONFLICT STILL GOVERNED BY UNSWERVING DEVOTION OF
NORTH AND VC TO REUNIFY COUNTRY.  SPECULATION EXISTS
THAT HANOI EXPECTED US PRESSURE ON THIEU TO ADHERE
TO C-F AND DWINDLING AID TO WEAKEN AND TOPPLE GVN.
THIS DID NOT HAPPEN, SO COMMUNISTS APPEAR TO HAVE
TURNED CLOCK BACK.

OUTCOME REMAINS UNPREDICTABLE, WITH ECON WOES POSSIBLY
BEING TRANSLATED INTO POLITICAL UNREST OR MIL APATHY.
BEYOND QUESTIONS OF POSSIBLE INTERNAL OPPOSITION
AND REACTION IN US, CHINA AND SOVIET, LIE SUBTLE
POINTS OF POWER AND POLITICS.  SHIPLER QUOTES SVN
OFFICIAL THAT GOAL IS TO GAIN RESPECT FROM COMMUNISTS,
TO RID THEM OF IDEA THAT SOUTH VIETS ARE PUPPETS;
MIL AID CUTS WILL RESOLVE NOTHING, SINCE THIS IS
&quot;TOTAL WAR IN EVERY SENSE.&quot;

FEELS IMPLICATIONS OF CHINA'S EMERGENCE AS MAJOR OIL
POWER ARE AS INTRIGUING AS THEY ARE CONJECTURAL.
SEES SIGNALS -- ESPECIALLY JAPAN'S PULLING BACK FROM
OIL/GAS PROJECT IN SOVIET SIBERIA -- THAT PEKING
IS QUITE PREPARED TO DEPLOY ITS OWN OIL WEAPONS TO
SUPPORT OF ITS STRATEGIC AND DIPLOMATIC INTERESTS.
CITES VIEW OF SOME US SOURCES THAT PEKING'S DEALINGS
WITH JAPAN &quot;PAID OFF&quot; BY DEFLECTING MOSCOW-TOKYO
SIBERIA DEAL, AND THAT CHINA'S OFFER OF CRUDE OIL TO
FRG AND AUSTRALIA DISPLAYS AWARENESS THAT HER SUPPORT
OF ARAB &quot;OIL WEAPON&quot; HARMS SUPERPOWERS LESS THAN WE
COMMUNITY.

SUN SAYS MUCH OF CHINESE DECISION WHETHER TO SELL US
OIL IN QUANTITY AND BUY OUR OIL-DRILLING TECHNOLOGY
MAY DEPEND ON SPEED WITH WHICH US NORMALIZES RELATIONS
AND TERMS BY WHICH US FIRMS WILL WANT TO TRADE WITH
CHINA.  BUT IT IS APPARENT THAT EMERGENCE OF ANOTHER
MAJOR OIL EXPORTER ON WORLD MARKET IS BOUND TO
BRIGHTEN GENERAL SUPPLY PICTURE AND EASE SOME OF
PRESSURES ON LARGE CONSUMERS.  SINCE US, JAPAN AND
WE SHARE SOME OF PEKING'S TREPIDATIONS ABOUT SOVIET,
IT IS REASSURING THAT CHINESE OIL MAY BE LIGHTING LOT
WORLD'S LAMPS.

PHINQ'S POTHIER REPORTS CONCLUSIONS OF PHILA CHILD
PSYCHIATRIST DR. THEODORE COHEN, WHO RETURNED FROM
CHINA STUDY TRIP FEW MONTHS AGO, THAT CONTRARY TO
VIEW OF MOST AMERICANS, CHINA ACTUALLY TREATS ITS
CHILDREN WITH &quot;WARM, CONSISTENT GENTLENESS&quot; -- AND
THAT AMERICA MIGHT DO WELL TO ADOPT SOME, BUT NOT ALL,
OF SUCCESSFUL PRC CHILD-REARING PRACTICES.  COHEN
FOUND THAT CHINA HAS SOMEHOW CREATED ENVIRONMENT
IN WHICH CHILD ABUSE IS UNHEARD-OF, WITH CHILDREN
UNIVERSALLY WELL-FED, SMILING AND HAPPY AND PROBLEMS
SUCH AS DRUG ABUSE AND DELINQUENCY NON-EXISTENT.
BUT CHINESE SOCIETY PAY OBVIOUS PRICE FOR THIS
ENVIRONMENT IN TERMS DE- EMPHASIS ON INDIVIDUALITY,
