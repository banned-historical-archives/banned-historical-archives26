		<h3>Tor</h3>
		<p><a href="https://www.torproject.org">Tor</a> is an encrypted anonymising network that makes it harder to intercept internet communications, or see where communications are coming from or going to.</p>
		<p>In order to use the WikiLeaks public submission system as detailed above you can download the Tor Browser Bundle, which is a Firefox-like browser available for Windows, Mac OS X and GNU/Linux and pre-configured to connect using the anonymising system Tor.</p>
		<h4>Tails</h4>
		<p>If you are at high risk and you have the capacity to do so, you can also access the submission system through a secure operating system called <a href="https://tails.boum.org">Tails</a>. Tails is an operating system launched from a USB stick or a DVD that aim to leaves no traces when the computer is shut down after use and automatically routes your internet traffic through Tor. Tails will require you to have either a USB stick or a DVD at least 4GB big and a laptop or desktop computer.</p>

		<h3>Tips</h3>
		<p>Our submission system works hard to preserve your anonymity, but we recommend you also take some of your own precautions. Please review these basic guidelines. </p>
		<div>
			<h4>1. Contact us if you have specific problems</h4>
			<p>If you have a very large submission, or a submission with a complex format, or are a high-risk source, please <a href="#submit_help_contact">contact us</a>. In our experience it is always possible to find a custom solution for even the most seemingly difficult situations.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h4>2. What computer to use</h4>
			<p>If the computer you are uploading from could subsequently be audited in an investigation, consider using a computer that is not easily tied to you. Technical users can also use <a href="https://tails.boum.org">Tails</a> to help ensure you do not leave any records of your submission on the computer.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h4>3. Do not talk about your submission to others</h4>
			<p>If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in source protection – it is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This includes other media organisations.</p>
		</div>

	</div>
</div>

<div id="submit_help_after" class="submit_elem">

			</div>
		</div>

		<h3>After</h3>

		<div>
			<h4>1. Do not talk about your submission to others</h4>
			<p>If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in source protection – it is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This includes other media organisations.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h4>2. Act normal</h4>
			<p>If you are a high-risk source, avoid saying anything or doing anything after submitting which might promote suspicion. In particular, you should try to stick to your normal routine and behaviour.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h4>3. Remove traces of your submission</h4>
			<p>If you are a high-risk source and the computer you prepared your submission on, or uploaded it from, could subsequently be audited in an investigation, we recommend that you format and dispose of the computer hard drive and any other storage media you used.</p>
			<p>In particular, hard drives retain data after formatting which may be visible to a digital forensics team and flash media (USB sticks, memory cards and SSD drives) retain data even after a secure erasure. If you used flash media to store sensitive data, it is important to destroy the media.</p>
			<p>If you do this and are a high-risk source you should make sure there are no traces of the clean-up, since such traces themselves may draw suspicion.</p>
			<div>
				<h4>4. If you face legal action</h4>
				<p>If a legal action is brought against you as a result of your submission, there are organisations that may help you. The Courage Foundation is an international organisation dedicated to the protection of journalistic sources. You can find more details at <a href="https://www.couragefound.org">https://www.couragefound.org</a>.</p>

		<p>WikiLeaks publishes documents of political or historical importance that are censored or otherwise suppressed. We specialise in strategic global publishing and large archives.</p>
		<p>The following is the address of our secure site where you can anonymously upload your documents to WikiLeaks editors. You can only access this submissions system through Tor. (See our <a href="#submit_help_tor">Tor tab</a> for more information.) We also advise you to read our <a href="#submit_help_tips">tips for sources</a> before submitting.</p>

   Can you double check with this source about Montaperto.<br />
<br />
   He was defended by many in the intelligence community, though eventually<br />
   admitted to leaking classified infrormation to Chiense officials.  I<br />
   wonder how much of this was actual spying and how much of this was trying<br />
   to trade information or develop guanxi.  Or are guys like Lonnie Henley <br />
   (who defended Montaperto) potentially spies too?  Henley was the senior<br />
   DNI officer on East Asia.<br />
<br />
   Thanks,<br />

 Sent you a Gertz piece on it that isn't 100% per cent accurate (it<br />
 minimizes the FBI screw up and the fact it wasn't them who eventually<br />
 got to Monteperto) but it's pretty good.<br />

 Beijing's spies gain access to secrets<br />
 'Panda huggers' tilt U.S. policy<br />
 By Bill Gertz<br />
 THE WASHINGTON TIMES<br />
<br />
 Missteps and appeasement by the U.S. government helped China develop<br />
 into a dangerous global power, according to &quot;The China Threat: How the<br />
 People's Republic Targets America&quot; (Regnery), a new book by Bill Gertz,<br />
 national security reporter for The Washington Times. In the first of<br />
 three excerpts, he details the hunt for Chinese spies burrowed deep<br />
 inside the U.S. government.<br />
<br />
 Let your plans be dark and impenetrable as night, and when you move,<br />
 fall like a thunderbolt.<br />
 -- Sun Tzu<br />
 Ancient Chinese strategist<br />
<br />
 In the early 1990s, the FBI came across evidence that amounted to a<br />
 counterspy's worst nightmare: Classified reports showed communist China<br />
 was running several ``assets'' - spies, in the vernacular - who operated<br />
 clandestinely inside the U.S. government.<br />
<br />
 One spy, however, was different from the others. He didn't work for just<br />
 any agency. He had burrowed deep inside the U.S. intelligence community,<br />
 meaning that the People's Republic of China had access to vital secrets.<br />
<br />
 The information was revealed to FBI counterintelligence agents in highly<br />
 sensitive communications intercepts between the Chinese Embassy in<br />
 Washington and Chinese intelligence officers in Beijing. The intercepts<br />
 suggested the agent was supplying the Chinese with classified defense<br />
 information.<br />
<br />
 The spy's code name was ``Ma'' - Chinese for ``horse.''<br />
<br />
 A Chinese government official who defected to the United States after<br />
 the Tiananmen Square massacre in 1989 also told U.S. intelligence that<br />
 China had successfully developed five to 10 clandestine sources of<br />
 information here.<br />
<br />
 The defector said these agents were known as ``Dear Friends'' of China.<br />
 And one had access to the most sensitive U.S. intelligence data, known<br />
 as Top Secret-Sensitive Compartmented Information, or SCI.<br />
<br />
 FBI counterintelligence agents' search for this Chinese ``mole'' led to<br />
 the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), the Pentagon's intelligence arm.<br />
 A key suspect emerged: Ronald Montaperto.<br />
<br />
 At the time, Mr. Montaperto was a senior DIA analyst specializing in<br />
 ``estimates,'' or analyses, of matters related to China and East Asia.<br />
 His job required making official contacts with Chinese government and<br />
 military officials. In Washington, that meant defense attaches posted to<br />
 the Chinese Embassy.<br />
<br />
 Chinese defense attaches are officers who work for the military<br />
 intelligence department of the People's Liberation Army's General Staff.<br />
 One was PLA Maj. Gen. Yu Zhenghe, the air attache, who had developed a<br />
 close relationship with Mr. Montaperto - close enough to be invited to<br />
 his wedding in 1990.<br />
<br />
 WARNINGS BY DEFECTORS<br />
 This hunt for a Chinese mole was rare for the FBI. Most of the other<br />
 moles uncovered inside the U.S. government during the 1980s, in what<br />
 became known as the ``Decade of the Spy,'' were spies for the Soviet<br />
 Union. There was one exception: A Chinese intelligence officer who<br />
 defected to the United States in 1985 identified a Chinese language<br />
 specialist for the U.S. government as a spy.<br />
<br />
 The defector was Yu Qiangsheng, a senior intelligence officer in the<br />
 Ministry of State Security. Mr. Yu had extensive access to information<br />
 about Chinese intelligence operations and agents. It was Mr. Yu who<br />
 first put a CIA counterspy on to Larry Wu-Tai Chin, the Chinese language<br />
 specialist, who worked for the CIA's Foreign Broadcast Information<br />
 Service. The service publishes translations of foreign news publications<br />
 and broadcasts.<br />
<br />
 Mr. Yu, who was resettled in the United States, remains under federal<br />
 protection. He fears for his life because of Beijing agents.<br />
<br />
 Mr. Chin eventually was unmasked. He had burrowed within the CIA for<br />
 about 30 years, passing valuable political intelligence to Beijing. He<br />
 was a rare catch, but before he could be interrogated thoroughly for<br />
 ``damage assessment,'' he committed suicide in his jail cell.<br />
<br />
 After the bloody military crackdown on protesters in Beijing's Tiananmen<br />
 Square, several other Chinese intelligence officers defected, determined<br />
 to help the United States defeat the Communist government. Two had<br />
 worked inside the Chinese Embassy in Washington.<br />
<br />
 The defectors' information helped to confirm and update what Mr. Yu had<br />
 provided years earlier. They explained the care with which Chinese<br />
 intelligence contacted and serviced its clandestine agents. For<br />
 instance, intelligence officers never met their agents inside the United<br />
 States because the FBI was considered too good at catching spies. It was<br />
 safer to meet abroad, preferably in China.<br />
<br />
 These defectors had access to intelligence reports - sent from the<br />
 embassy to Ministry of State Security headquarters in China - that<br />
 revealed that Chinese intelligence had recruited several agents who were<br />
 referred to as ``Dear Friends.'' The Dear Friends were rewarded for<br />
 valuable intelligence with paid trips to China, business opportunities<br />
 there and prestige-building access to senior Chinese officials.<br />
<br />
 From their knowledge of the Chinese Embassy's intelligence cables, the<br />
 defectors were able to tell U.S. intelligence debriefers about details<br />
 China obtained from the Dear Friends. The U.S. counterspies were<br />
 troubled that large amounts of extremely sensitive military intelligence<br />
 was being provided to China.<br />
<br />
 INTERROGATING A SUSPECT<br />
 Based on the defectors' testimony, the FBI began a major espionage probe.<br />
<br />
 The bureau came up with a list of 12 suspects that fit the profile of<br />
 the Dear Friend with access to U.S. military secrets.<br />
<br />
 During systematic ``interviews'' of each suspect, FBI agents met with<br />
 Mr. Montaperto in late 1991 or early 1992. At the time, he was chief of<br />
 DIA's estimates branch for China, a job he held from September 1989<br />
 until his departure in February 1992. He had joined DIA as an analyst in<br />
 October 1981 and worked his way up.<br />
<br />
 Intelligence intercepts of Chinese government communications gathered by<br />
 the National Security Agency and supplied to the FBI later revealed that<br />
 one of the most important agents being run by Chinese intelligence was<br />
 code-named Ma.<br />
<br />
 FBI agents eventually confronted Mr. Montaperto during what the bureau<br />
 called ``hostile interrogations'' over the course of three meetings.<br />
 They asked bluntly whether he had passed classified intelligence<br />
 information to China's intelligence service.<br />
<br />
 No, Mr. Montaperto replied. He said any contacts with Chinese<br />
 intelligence were authorized. He did conceded to the DIA that he knew<br />
 Gen. Yu, the Chinese intelligence officer.<br />
<br />
 The FBI cleared Mr. Montaperto, though some counterintelligence<br />
 officials still suspected he was Ma but couldn't prove it. The matter<br />
 was put to rest conclusively, Mr. Montaperto said.<br />
<br />
 ``I can honestly say they looked me in the eye and said, `We don't think<br />
 you're a spy,' '' he said of the meetings with FBI agents.<br />
<br />
 But soon after the investigation, Mr. Montaperto left the DIA. In an<br />
 interview with this reporter, he said the FBI probe had nothing to do<br />
 with his departure. As for his friendship with Gen. Yu, he said: ``One<br />
 does not have friends with Chinese officials'' - meaning his contacts<br />
 were strictly professional.<br />
<br />
 ``Did General Yu attend your wedding?'' this reporter asked. ``Yes,''<br />
 Mr. Montaperto said.<br />
<br />
 It was a relatively small wedding, he said, because it was his second<br />
 marriage. He said he invited Gen. Yu and other Chinese officials because<br />
 he thought it would be a good experience for them.<br />
<br />
 Hanging on the wall inside Mr. Montaperto's office was a large scroll of<br />
 Chinese calligraphy. It contained the characters ``horse dragon<br />
 virtue,'' which when spoken in Mandarin sound like ``Montaperto.'' A<br />
 second set of characters on the scroll are Chinese for ``war horse.''<br />
<br />
 The scroll is signed by a Chinese intelligence officer, who, like Yu<br />
 Zhenghe, was an attache at the Chinese Embassy in Washington when Mr.<br />
 Montaperto received the scroll as a gift. Mr. Montaperto says a student<br />
 in Shanghai gave it to him.<br />
<br />
 A PANDA HUGGER?<br />
 The FBI never found the clandestine spy known as Ma. The bureau did<br />
 uncover several Dear Friends, but did not seek prosecution. The FBI was<br />
 hamstrung by the limited details provided by the former Chinese<br />
 intelligence officers, who had seen the cables but did not have hard copies.<br />
<br />
 One Chinese agent was a Chinese-American employee at a U.S. defense<br />
 contractor in Northern Virginia. Although he was not prosecuted, his<br />
 access to classified information was cut off.<br />
<br />
 Mr. Montaperto next went to work at the Pentagon's National Defense<br />
 University at Fort McNair, a scenic base overlooking the Potomac River<br />
 in Southwest Washington. He became a ``social science analyst'' with the<br />
 university's Institute for National Strategic Studies, a think tank for<br />
 security issues.<br />
<br />
 Mr. Montaperto's biography as posted on the university's Internet site<br />
 contains only four sentences and makes no mention of his DIA experience.<br />
 It states only that he is a China affairs specialist: ``Currently he is<br />
 defining strategies and policies for managing future U.S. interests in<br />
 the Asia- Pacific region.''<br />
<br />
 Because the FBI could not prove its suspicions, Mr. Montaperto was<br />
 allowed to retain his top-secret security clearance. But he does not<br />
 have the same access to intelligence information as he had at DIA.<br />
<br />
 Gen. Yu, meanwhile, remains one of China's most important intelligence<br />
 officers. He works for Gen. Xiong Guangkai, the PLA's deputy chief of<br />
 staff for intelligence.<br />
<br />
 According to one U.S. national security official, Gen. Xiong returned to<br />
 the United States in 1996 during the Taiwan Strait crisis and tried to<br />
 meet Mr. Montaperto. The crisis was prompted by test firings of Chinese<br />
 missiles near Taiwan; the United States dispatched two aircraft carrier<br />
 battle groups to the region.<br />
<br />
 Mr. Montaperto's primary job at the government's National Defense<br />
 University is to oversee the China portion of an annual ``Strategic<br />
 Assessment,'' to speak on China policy around the world and to organize<br />
 an occasional conference on China. His pronounced pro-China view plays<br />
 down that nation's military capabilities, specifically its development<br />
 of strategic and conventional forces.<br />
<br />
 But Mr. Montaperto says he is no ``panda hugger,'' using the derogatory<br />
 term China specialists at the Pentagon employ for soft-liners.<br />
<br />
 ``For some people, I will always be considered a panda hugger,'' he added.<br />
<br />
 `HIDE BRIGHTNESS'<br />
 When Congress ordered creation of a National Defense University<br />
 clearinghouse for intelligence on the People's Liberation Army, Mr.<br />
 Montaperto presented the plan to the Pentagon. It called for hiring 33<br />
 specialists, opening a large office in Southwest and spending $4.5<br />
 million a year.<br />
<br />
 At first the Pentagon rejected the plan because it appeared to promote<br />
 military-to-military contacts with the PLA rather than provide useful<br />
 information about the strategy and direction of the Chinese military.<br />
<br />
 The Clinton administration already had dramatically increased meetings<br />
 and exchanges with Chinese military leaders, which the Chinese exploited<br />
 to develop intelligence. Many in the Pentagon had had enough of that,<br />
 and senior officials objected to Mr. Montaperto's appointment as<br />
 director of the new center. But the university named him director anyway.<br />
<br />
 The importance of the center was highlighted when Mr. Clinton opposed<br />
 the requirement to set it up.<br />
<br />
 By mandating the center and reports on China's military buildup,<br />
 Congress assumes ``an outcome that is far from foreordained - that China<br />
 is bent on becoming a military threat to the United States,'' the<br />
 president said in signing a $289 billion defense bill in October 1999.<br />
 ``I believe we should not make it more likely that China will choose<br />
 this path by acting as if the decision has already been made.''<br />
<br />
 Yet the president's policies and those of the soft-liners who refused to<br />
 recognize the nature of the People's Republic of China had done more to<br />
 increase the danger from China than any of the skeptics in Congress who<br />
 believed more should be done to learn about the Communist regime's<br />
 military intentions.<br />
<br />
 Mr. Montaperto's minimizing of the threat is at one with Chinese<br />
 military policy, which involves deception - preventing the U.S.<br />
 ``hegemon'' from recognizing China's emerging power until it is greater,<br />
 at least regionally, than that of the United States.<br />
<br />
 The late Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping said China must avoid provoking a<br />
 conflict with the United States until China has the military, economic<br />
 and political power to win.<br />
<br />
 In the words of Mr. Deng: ``Hide brightness; nourish obscurity.'' Or as<br />
 the official translation in Beijing put it, ``Bide our time and build up<br />
 our capabilities.''<br />
<br />
 FRIENDLY `SPECIALISTS'<br />
 Chinese military writings predict a ``dangerous decade'' - when that<br />
 nation faces a strategic checkmate - between 2020 and 2030. By 2020, the<br />
 United States will not be able to ignore China's growing might. But<br />
 China's military and strategic planners fear their country will not be<br />
 powerful enough to take on the United States until 2030.<br />
<br />
 What China wanted was three more decades of Clinton-style<br />
 ``engagement,'' a policy that downplays Chinese military capabilities,<br />
 encourages decreasing U.S. defense spending and gives China major<br />
 technical and financial boosts. Chinese officials view certain<br />
 specialists in the United States as important outlets for Beijing's<br />
 views. Many of these China specialists are current or former government<br />
 officials.<br />
<br />
 Unlike the thousands of political scientists who specialize in European<br />
 and Russian affairs, the China experts who specialize in international<br />
 security and foreign affairs could fit in a large conference room. And<br />
 most of them communicate via Internet discussion groups, a major target<br />
 of influence exerted by the Chinese government.<br />
<br />
 Take ``Chinasec.'' Every morning, a group of about 100 high-level U.S.<br />
 policy-makers and intelligence officials receives e-mail postings as<br />
 part of this Internet discussion group, whose innocuous-sounding name<br />
 stands for ``China security.''<br />
<br />
 The informal electronic gathering includes some of the most important<br />
 China policy-makers in the U.S. government, including the Pentagon's<br />
 desk officer for China matters, Col. John Corbett. The group is<br />
 decidedly pro- China and often criticizes news articles - in particular<br />
 this reporter's work for The Washington Times - that explore Chinese<br />
 weapons sales to rogue states or espionage against the United States.<br />
<br />
 For instance, when The Times reported on the critical views of China<br />
 held by Condoleeza Rice, a key foreign policy adviser to Republican<br />
 presidential nominee George W. Bush, Chinasec swung into action. The<br />
 e-mail network adopted the standard posture of the Clinton<br />
 administration: spin. It dismissed the article as exaggerated and the<br />
 work of a ``nonexpert.''<br />
<br />
 Chinasec's on-line discussion group is secret, but not in the sense of<br />
 that term denoted by the U.S. government classification. Most of<br />
 Chinasec's participants hold high-level security clearances. At least 10<br />
 CIA officials are members.<br />
<br />
 Chinasec is part of an informal but powerful network of current and<br />
 former officials, academics and other China experts who exert a major<br />
 influence on U.S. policies toward China.<br />
<br />
 THE LITMUS TEST<br />
 The ancient Chinese strategist Sun Tzu wrote that ``supreme excellence<br />
 consists in breaking the enemy's resistance without fighting.''<br />
<br />
 The view of China presented by these pro-Beijing specialists is not<br />
 manufactured by the Chinese Communist Politburo, but it serves the<br />
 Politburo's strategy. The key theme of the propaganda directed abroad is<br />
 simple: China is not a threat.<br />
<br />
 The theme is central to the Chinese Communist Party's overt and covert<br />
 influence efforts. It is the litmus test for those experts that Beijing<br />
 labels ``Friends of China.'' And it was a constant refrain of the<br />
 Clinton administration.<br />
<br />
 Despite the soft-line approach, a public opinion poll last year showed<br />
 that Mr. Clinton's policy of engagement had not convinced the majority<br />
 of the American people that China is a benign power.<br />
<br />
 The results of the Wall Street Journal-NBC News poll, published in<br />
 September 1999, indicate that 60 percent to 80 percent consider China to<br />
 be an ``adversary,'' not a strategic partner.<br />
