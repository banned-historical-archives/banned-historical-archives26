		<h3>Tor</h3>
		<p><a href="https://www.torproject.org">Tor</a> is an encrypted anonymising network that makes it harder to intercept internet communications, or see where communications are coming from or going to.</p>
		<p>In order to use the WikiLeaks public submission system as detailed above you can download the Tor Browser Bundle, which is a Firefox-like browser available for Windows, Mac OS X and GNU/Linux and pre-configured to connect using the anonymising system Tor.</p>
		<h4>Tails</h4>
		<p>If you are at high risk and you have the capacity to do so, you can also access the submission system through a secure operating system called <a href="https://tails.boum.org">Tails</a>. Tails is an operating system launched from a USB stick or a DVD that aim to leaves no traces when the computer is shut down after use and automatically routes your internet traffic through Tor. Tails will require you to have either a USB stick or a DVD at least 4GB big and a laptop or desktop computer.</p>

		<h3>Tips</h3>
		<p>Our submission system works hard to preserve your anonymity, but we recommend you also take some of your own precautions. Please review these basic guidelines. </p>
		<div>
			<h4>1. Contact us if you have specific problems</h4>
			<p>If you have a very large submission, or a submission with a complex format, or are a high-risk source, please <a href="#submit_help_contact">contact us</a>. In our experience it is always possible to find a custom solution for even the most seemingly difficult situations.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h4>2. What computer to use</h4>
			<p>If the computer you are uploading from could subsequently be audited in an investigation, consider using a computer that is not easily tied to you. Technical users can also use <a href="https://tails.boum.org">Tails</a> to help ensure you do not leave any records of your submission on the computer.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h4>3. Do not talk about your submission to others</h4>
			<p>If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in source protection – it is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This includes other media organisations.</p>
		</div>

	</div>

		<h3>After</h3>

		<div>
			<h4>1. Do not talk about your submission to others</h4>
			<p>If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in source protection – it is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This includes other media organisations.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h4>2. Act normal</h4>
			<p>If you are a high-risk source, avoid saying anything or doing anything after submitting which might promote suspicion. In particular, you should try to stick to your normal routine and behaviour.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h4>3. Remove traces of your submission</h4>
			<p>If you are a high-risk source and the computer you prepared your submission on, or uploaded it from, could subsequently be audited in an investigation, we recommend that you format and dispose of the computer hard drive and any other storage media you used.</p>
			<p>In particular, hard drives retain data after formatting which may be visible to a digital forensics team and flash media (USB sticks, memory cards and SSD drives) retain data even after a secure erasure. If you used flash media to store sensitive data, it is important to destroy the media.</p>
			<p>If you do this and are a high-risk source you should make sure there are no traces of the clean-up, since such traces themselves may draw suspicion.</p>
			<div>
				<h4>4. If you face legal action</h4>
				<p>If a legal action is brought against you as a result of your submission, there are organisations that may help you. The Courage Foundation is an international organisation dedicated to the protection of journalistic sources. You can find more details at <a href="https://www.couragefound.org">https://www.couragefound.org</a>.</p>

		<p>WikiLeaks publishes documents of political or historical importance that are censored or otherwise suppressed. We specialise in strategic global publishing and large archives.</p>
		<p>The following is the address of our secure site where you can anonymously upload your documents to WikiLeaks editors. You can only access this submissions system through Tor. (See our <a href="#submit_help_tor">Tor tab</a> for more information.) We also advise you to read our <a href="#submit_help_tips">tips for sources</a> before submitting.</p>

			<!--<div>
				Copy this address into your Tor browser. Advanced users, if they wish, can also add a further layer of encryption to their submission using <a href="#submit_wlkey">our public PGP key</a>.
			</div>-->
		</div>

		<p>If you cannot use Tor, or your submission is very large, or you have specific requirements, WikiLeaks provides several alternative methods. <a href="#submit_help_contact">Contact us</a> to discuss how to proceed.</p>

PRESS, BROADCASTS OF THE &quot;VOICE OF AMERICA,&quot; &quot;VOICE OF
GERMANY,&quot; AND BBC, AND ALSO THE RESULTS OF MANY YEARS OF
OBSERVATION, ROD HAS COME TO THE CONCLUSION, THAT THERE
IS IN THE KREMLIN A ZIONIST GROUP: YU. V. ANDROPOV,
L. I. BREZHNEV, A. A. GROMYKO, D. A. KUNAYEV, V. V.
KUZNETSOV, A. YA. PEL'SHE, B. N. PONOMAREV, D. F. USTINOV,
K. U. CHERNENKO AND OTHERS. THE FACTS PRESENTED BELOW
WILL CONFIRM THE CORRECTNESS OF THIS STUNNING CONCLUSION
OF ROD.
.-----1. THE FORMER HEAD OF THE PARTY AND GOVERNMENT, TRUE
SON OF THE RUSSIAN PEOPLE, N. S. KHRUSCHEV, WAS OVERTHROWN
AS THE RESULT OF A ZIONIST PLOT, IN WHICH CERTAIN RUSSIANS
AND UKRAINIANS BECAME ACCOMPLICES BY VIRTUE OF BEING ILLINFORMED. N. S. KHRUSCHEV WAS THE MOST FEROCIOUS ENEMY OF
THE ZIONISTS, SINCE HE UNDERMINED FOREVER THEIR UNDIVIDED
DOMINATION IN THE USSR, LAID A FIRM FOUNDATION FOR THE
GROWTH OF THE MATERIAL WELFARE AND CULTURAL LEVEL OF THE
WHOLE PEOPLE, INTRODUCED A WHOLE SYSTEM OF MEASURES (THE
ESTABLISHMENT OF THE FORTY-ONE HOUR, FIVE-DAY, WORKWEEK;
THEEXPLOTATION OF THE VIRGIN LANDS AND OF FALLOW LANDS;
THE FOUNDATION OF THE SO AN USSR (SIBERIAN BRANCH OF
ACADEMY OF SCIENCE? ' T' THE PURPOSE OF LARGE SCALE

COLLAR WORKERS AND THE INCREASE IN PENSION PAYMENTS AND
THE CREATION OF PENSIONS FOR COLLECTIVE FARMERS; THE
CONSTRUCTION ON A MASSIVE SCALE OF HOUSING PROJECTS; THE
INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF HIGHER EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS,
AND THE INTRODUCTION OF PREFERENTIAL ADMISSION FROM
VILLAGE SCHOOLS; THE CONSTRUCTION OF ENTERPRISES FOR THE
PRODUCTION OF CONSUMER GOODS; THE RESOLUTION THAT WAS
PASSED CONCERNING THE RECONSTRUCTION OF VILLAGES AND THE
CONSTRUCTION OF CULTURAL CENTERS IN THEM (DID NOT HAVE
TIME TO COMPLETE); REDUCTION IN THE PERIOD OF SERVICE IN
THE ARMED FORCES AND OTHERS.
2. HAVING BECOME HEAD OF THE PARTY, BREZHNEV AWARDED
HIMSELF, IN 1965, THE TITLE &quot;HERO OF SOVIET UNION,&quot; PRESUMABLY FOR HIS VICTORY OVER N. S. KHRUSCHEV. IN APRIL,
1967, HE NAMED TO THE POST OF MINISTER OF DEFENSE THE
ZIONIST A. A. GRECHKO, AND A MONTH LATER, FEELING HIS
STRENGTH, NAMED TO THE POST OF CHAIRMAN OF THE KGB THE
ZIONIST YU. V. ANDROPOV. HAVING TAKEN CONTROL OVER THE
ARMY AND KGB, BREZHNEV WITHOUT CEREMONY USURPED THE POWER
OF HEAD OF GOVERNMENT, N. V. PODGORNIY, AND HEAD OF
STATE, A. N. KOSYGIN, AND ELIMINATED THEM FROM ACTIVE

HEAD OF THE PARTY, VIOLATING THE CONSTITUTION OF THE USSR.
3. AFTER THE UNMASKING BY N. S. KHRUSCHEV AT THE XX
CONGRESS OF THE PERSONALITY CULT AND THE CRIMES OF I. V.
STALIN (TENS OF MILLIONS OF ENTIRELY INNOCENT RUSSIANS
AND UKRAINIANS, WERE ELIMINATED, INCLUDING ALL THE
DELEGATES TO THE XVIII CONGRESS) AND THE ABOLITION AT THE
XXII CONGRESS OF THE DICTATORSHIP OF THE PROLETARIAT,
ZIONISTS UNDERSTOOD THAT THEIR ROAD OF RETURN TO TOTAL
SUPREMACY IN THE USSR HAD BEEN CUT FOREVER. THEREFORE,
THEY DECIDED TO DISORGANIZE THE ECONOMY, THUS DEMONSTRATING
ITS UNVIABILITY AND RETURN TO A MIXED ECONOMY INCLUDING
GOVERNMENTAL AND PRIVATE ENTERPRISES. ZIONIST ACADEMICIAN
A. D. SAKHAROV SPOKE OF THE EXPEDIENCY OF SUCH AN
ECONOMY FOR THE USSR IN AN INTERVIEW GIVEN TO A SWEDISH
CORRESPONDENT IN 1974, AND BREZHNEV (SPOKE) ABOUT THE
NEED TO INTRODUCE PRIVATE ENTERPRISE AT THE SESSION OF THE
SUPREME SOVIET OF THE USSR, IN DEFENDING CHAPTER 17 OF THE
CONSTITUTION, PERMITTING PRIVATE BUSINESS UNDERTAKINGS
(CHASTNOE PREDPRINIMATELSTVO). SUCH AN ECONOMY WOULD
PERMIT THE JEWS TO MAKE USE OF (PUSTIT' V OBOROT) THE
HUGE CAPITAL THEY HAVE DISHONESTLY ACCUMULATED AND TO
EXPLOIT THE RUSSIAN AND UKRAINIAN PEOPLES. HAVING CON-

SOLIDATED THEIR POSITION IN THE KREMLIN, THE ZIONISTS TRIED
TO UNDERMINE ACTIVITY IN ALL SPHERES OF THE ECONOMY. THE
IMPORTANT DECISIONS DF THE XXII CONGRESS WERE DISCREDITED.
CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL
PAGE 02

LENING 00988 02 OF 06 021815Z

THE DECISIONS OF THE XXI CONGRESS WERE COMPLETELY IGNORED
ABOUT DECISIVELY TERMINATING THE PRACTICE OF DISPERSING
CAPITAL INVESTMENT AMONG NUMEROUS CONSTRUCTION SITES AND
PROJECTS. AT PRESENT IN THE COUNTRY, MORE THAN 175,000
CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS ARE BEING BUILT. THE PERIOD OF TIME
REQUIRED FOR CONSTRUCTION OF A PROJECT IS 6-10 YEARS.
SAYANO-SHUSHENSKAYA HYDRO-ELECTRIC STATION HAS BEEN UNDER
CONSTRUCTION FOR 16 YEARS, BUT TO DATE ONLY ONE UNIT HAS
BEGUN TO OPERATE. THE KIEV HYDRO-ELECTRIC STATION IS
COMPLETELY INACTIVE, AS A RESULT TENS OF BILLIONS OF
NATIONAL FUNDS HAVE BEEN THROWN TO THE WINDS, NOT TO SPEAK
OF THE HARM FROM RESETTLEMENT OF MANY TENS OF VILLAGES
AND THE FLOODING OF THOUSANDS OF HECTARS OF FERTILE LAND.
ONE KM. OF THE BAM EXCEEDS THE ESTIMATES BY TENS OF
TIMES. THE ECONOMIC EXPEDIENCY OF THE BAM BEING UNDERTAKEN AT A DISTANCE OF 200-300 KM FROM THE
TRANS-SIBERIAN RAILWAY IS VERY DUBIOUS. IT WOULD HAVE BEEN
EXPEDIENT AT THE BEGINNING TO BUILD A RAILWAY TO THE
INCALCULABLE RICHES OF YAKUTSK AND ONLY AFTER EXPLOITING
THEM, MIGHT IT HAVE BEEN EXPEDIENT TO PROCEED WITH THE
CONSTRUCTION OF BAM FROM POPULATED CENTERS. THE INVULNERABILITY OF BAM IN THE EVENT OF A WAR WITH CHINA, AS
THE ZIONISTS SAY, WHILE PREPARING TO UNLEASH THAT WAR,
CANNOT BE ASSURED IN THE LIGHTOF CONTEMPORARY ROCKET/
NUCLEAR WEAPONS. THE RESOLUTION TAKEN UNDER KHRUSCHEV
CONCERNING THE RECONSTRUCTION OF VILLAGES AND THE CONSTRUCTION OF CULTURAL CENTERS THERE HAS BEEN IGNORED, AS
HAS THE DECISION ABOUT THE MECHANIZATION OF LABORINTENSIVE PROCESSES IN AGRICULTURE, WITH THE RESULT THAT A
LARGE PART OF THE YOUTH HAVE GONE TO THE TOWNS, AND MANY
RURAL INHABITANTS GO TENS OF KILOMETERS FROM THEIR
VILLAGES TO PURSUE THEIR FARMING WORK. THE SOVNARKHOZES,

THEREFORE, WE WILL DWELL ON THE MOST POWERFUL.
THE DAUGHTER OF THE RUSSIAN PEOPLE, E. A. FURTSEVA,

ATTACK IN HIS OWN OFFICE AFTER WHICH SHE QUICKLY

P. E. SHELEST, WAS OVERWHELMED THROUGH USE OF THE WELLTRIED ZIONIST WEAPON -- ACCUSATION OF NATIONALISM, AND
THROUGH ANOTHER ADROIT MANEUVER, WAS TRANSFERRED TO A NEW
POST IN MOSCOW AND QUICKLY AFTERWARDS PUT OUT ON PENSION,
DESPITE HIS VIGOROUS HEALTH. TO DISCREDIT THE TRUE SON

A DISCREDIT TO THE PARTY. AFTER THIS, IT BECAME CLEAR
TO A. N. SHELEPIN AND MANY SHARING HIS VIEWS THAT THE
ZIONISTS WERE SEATED IN THE KREMLIN.
THE UKRAINIAN D. S. POLYNSKY WAS EXPELLED FROM THE
POLITBURO AT THE 25TH CONGRESS, HAVING BEEN MADE A
SCAPEGOAT FOR FAILURES IN AGRICULTURE, WHERE HE HONESTLY
CARRIED OUT THE DECISIONS OF THE PLENUM AND THE PERSONAL
ORDERS OF BREZHNEV. THE UKRAINIAN SON, N. V. PODGORNIY,
WAS UNACCEPTABLE TO THE ZIONISTS FOR TWO REASONS. FIRST,
HE STEADFASTLY OPPOSED THE EXCLUSION OF THE MENTION OF
&quot;NATIONALITY&quot; FROM THE NEW PASSPORTS AND INTRODUCED AN
EDUCATION TAX ON JEWS LEAVING THE USSR; SECONDLY, THE
KREMLIN ZIONISTS DECIDED TO TAKE INTO THEIR HANDS THE POST
OF HEAD OF GOVERNMENT. IN ORDER TO DISCREDIT N. V.
PODGORNIY, THE KREMLIN ZIONISTS, KNOWING HIS POSITION
WITH REGARD TO AFRICAN COUNTRIES, ARRANGED A TRIP FOR HIM

MENTS SIGNED WITH THEM WHICH WERE NOT IN THE INTEREST OF THE
KREMLIN ZIONISTS, AND WHICH GAVE THEM A WAY TO JUSTIFY HIS
EXPULSION FROM THE POLITBURO AND HIS REMOVAL FROM THE
POST OF HEAD OF STATE.
5. A DECISION WAS TAKEN TO ELIMINATE THE DESIGNATION
&quot;NATIONALITY&quot; FROM PASSPORTS. FOR THIS L. I. BREZHNEV,
AT THE 24TH CONGRESS, HAD ADVANCED THE THESIS OF THE
APPEARANCE OF A NEW HISTORIC CATEGORY OF PEOPLE (IN ONLY
A HALF CENTURY, INSTEAD OF MANY THOUSANDS, JUST THINK OF
IT*), WHICH WAS USED AS A THEORETICAL BASIS FOR WORKING
OUT A NEW PASSPORT WITHOUT A SPACE FOR &quot;NATIONALITY.&quot;
HOWEVER, THE RESOLUTE OBJECTIONS OF N. V. PODGORNIY,
A. N. SHELEPIN, A. N. KOSYGIN, M. A. SUSLOV, G. V.
ROMANOV, P. E. SHELEST, AND MANY OTHER DEPUTIES, ON THE
OCCASION OF THE APPROVAL OF THE PROJECT OF A NEW PASSPORT
BY THE SUPREME SOVIET, PREVENTED THE KREMLIN ZIONISTS
FROM CARRYING OUT THEIR INSIDIOUS SCHEME.
6. THE MOVEMENT OF THE JEWISH INTELLIGENTSIA FOR
SO-CALLED HUMAN RIGHTS DEVELOPED WITHTHE FULL APPROVAL
AND SECRET SUPPORT OF THE KREMLIN ZIONISTS, AND IN MOST
RECENT TIMES ALSO THE MOVEMENT OF THE WRETCHED STRATA OF
JEWISH WORKERS FOR THE NOTORIOUS INDEPENDENT TRADE UNION.
FOR THE PURPOSE OF LEGALIZING THIS MOVEMENT AND PROVIDING
IT WITH INTERNATIONAL SUPPORT, THE KREMLIN ZIONISTS,
TOGETHER WITH THE ZIONISTS OF THE WEST, ORGANIZED THE
HELSINKI CONFERENCE ON SECURITY AND COOPERATION IN EUROPE.
ALTHOUGH THE FINAL ACT OF THE CONFERENCE DOES NOT HAVE

MOVEMENT IN THE USSR AND GOVERNMENT LEADERS (ZIONISTS)
OF CERTAIN COUNTRIES TO INTERFERE UNCEREMONIOUSLY IN THE
INTERNAL AFFAIRS OF THE USSR. IN THE RECENT POSTHELSINKI CONFERENCE PERIOD, THE TRUE AIM OF THE CONFERENCE HAS APPEARED CLEARLY. THE COUNRIES WHICH SIGNED
THE FINAL ACT, HAVE PRINCIPALLY BROUGHT INTO FORCE ITS
THIRD CHAPTER, ABANDONING THEIR PREVIOUS LEVEL OF
COOPERATION. AT THE 24TH SESSION OF NATO, THE PARLIAMENTARIANS OF THESE COUNTRIES SUPPORTED THE ARMS RACE,
BASING THEMSELVES ON THE MYTH OF THE SOVIET THREAT,
REVEALING BY THIS FACT THE TRUE GOAL OF THE CONFERENCE
IN HELSINKI. AFTER FIGHTERS FOR HUMAN RIGHTS IN MOSCOW
IN 1977 ORGANIZED A SERIES OF TERRORIST ACTS, THE KREMLIN
ZIONISTS WERE OBLIGED BY THE PRESSURE OF PUBLIC OPINION
TO TAKE ACTIVE MEASURES AGAINST THEM, CONDUCTING A SERIES
OF SHOW TRIALS AGAINST WELL-KNOWN MEMBERS OF THE JEWISH
MOVEMENT IN THE USSR.

THE IDEA THAT, AS UNDER STALIN, IT WOULD BE NEDITION OF &quot;THE FLAG OF

CRUDELY VIOLATED THE RULES OF THE PARTY, RECEIVING HEADS OF
DELEGATIONS AS SECRETARY GENERAL. AFTER THE CONGRESS, ALL
OF THE MASS MEDIA OF THE COUNTRY WITH THE VOICE OF ZIONISTS
BEGAN TO TRUMPET THE PRAISES OF BREZHNEV. THE WALLS OF
BUILDINGS WERE &quot;DECORATED&quot; WITH HUGE PORTRAITS OF BREZHNEV
AND HIS &quot;WISE SAYINGS.&quot; WITHIN A BRIEF PERIOD BREZHNEV
ACCOMPLISHES TENS OF HEROIC FEATS AND BECOMES TWICE HERO
OF CZECHOSLOVAKIA, TWICE BULGARIA, TWICE GDR, TWICE
POLAND AND OTHER COUNTRIES. ZIONIST KURT WALDHEIM GAVE
BREZHNEV A UN MEDAL. ON THE EVE OF HIS 70TH BIRTHDAY,
BREZHNEV AWARDED HIMSELF A SECOND HERO STAR, AAPARENTLY FOR
VICTORY OVER A. N. SHELEPIN. IN PEACE TIME, HE CREATES
A DEFENSE COMMITTEE AND ILLEGALLY MAKES HIMSELF ITS CHAIRMAN. HE AWARDS HIMSELF THE TITLE OF MARSHAL OF THE SOVIET
UNION AND WRITES HIS BIOGRAPHY WHICH, WITH THE HELP OF

CHINA, BOASTFULLY DECLARING THAT THE RUSSIAN AND UKRANIAN
PEOPLE WILL ALWAYS BE UNDER THE YOKE, IF NOT OF THE JEWS,
THEN OF THE CHINESE. MAO TSE-TUNG AND THE BAND OF FOUR
ARE CHINESE ZIONISTS. TENG HSIAO-PING AND HIS SUPPORTERS ARE HONEST
CHINESE. ON ONE OF THE WALL POSTERS IT WAS SAID THAT NOT ALL OF THE
SUPPORTERS OF THE BAND OF FOUR HAVE BEEN DRIVCEN FROM THE GOVERNMENT
AND THEY CONTINUE TO OCCUPY HIGH POSITIONS. EVIDENTLY THEY HAD IN
MIND THE CHAIRMAN OF THE PARTY HUA KUO-FENG, MINISTER OF FOREIGN
AFFAIRS KUAN-HUA AND OTHERS, WHO ARE ZIONISTS. THE TRUE
RELATIONSHIP OF FRIENDLY RELATIONS WITH THE USSR TO THE
THE FULLEST EXTENT WAS DEMANDED. IT IS IMPORTANT ALWAYS
TO REMEMBER THIS. USA PRESIDENT, THE ENGLISHMAN JAMES
CARTER, HAVING COMPREHENDED THE INSIDIOUS SCHEMES OF THE
ZIONISTS, BREAKS DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS WITH THE REPUBLIC
OF TAIWAN AND ESTABLISHES THEM IN FULL MEASURE WITH CHINA,
WHICH AROUSED A STORM OF INDIGNATION AMONG AMERICAN ZIONISTS LEAD BY GOLDWATER. THE ZIONISTS UNDERSTOOD THAT, BY
THIS ACT, JAMES CARTER IN PRACTICAL TERMS ALMOST REDUCED
TO NOTHING THE POSSIBILITY OF A DIRECT ATTACK BY THE USSR
ON CHINA. SEEING THIS TURN OF EVENTS, THE KREMLIN ZIONISTS
QUICKLY CONCLUDE A TREATY OF FRIENDSHIP AND COOPERATION
WITH VIETNAM (THERE THE ZIONISTS ARE ALSO IN
CONTROL OVER THE PARTY AND GOVERNMENT, OCCUPYING KEY
POSITIONS) AND GIVE VIET NAM AN ORDER TO UNDERTAKE PROVOCATIONS ON THE BORDER WITH CHINA AND CAMBODIA (SIC.), TO
CARRY OUT AN INVASION BY VIET NAM INTO CAMBODIA AND BY

CAMBODIA WAS SUBJUGATED, AND CHINA, NOT HAVING ANY LONGER
BEEN ABLE TO STAND THE INNUMERABLE PROVOCATIONS OF VIET

WILL ASK YOURSELVES, &quot;HOW COULD IT HAVE HAPPENED THAT
NO ONE PREVENTED THE ZIONISTS FROM SEIZING COMMANDING
POSITIONS IN PARTY AND STATE.&quot; LATER, AFTER SOME REFLECTION AND REMEMBERING THE LAST NAMES OF THE ABOVE MENTIONED
ZIONISTS, YOU YOURSELF CAN GIVE THE ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION
- ZIONISTS, HAVING PENETRATED TO POWER, ARE HIDDEN FROM
VIEW PUTTING THEMSELVES FORWARD AS RUSSIANS, UKRAINIANS,
BYELORUSSIANS AND OTHER NATIONALITIES. AFTER THIS, YOU
WILL NATURALLY ASK, &quot;HOW CAN A DISGUISED ZIONIST BE
DISTINGUISHED?&quot; THE ANSWER TO THIS QUESTION AT FIRST GLANCE
MIGHT SEEM TO BE EASY FOR MANY OF YOU, WHO THINK YOU CAN
DISTINGUISH THEM BY THEIR FACES AND FIGURES. HOWEVER,
IN PRACTICE IT IS NOT ALWAYS POSSIBLE TO DO THIS,
ESPECIALLY FOR ZIONISTS FROM MIXED MARRIAGES. NEVERTHELESS
ZIONISTS WILL ALMOST ALWAYS BE ABLE TO RECOGNIZE ONE
ANOTHER WITHOUT MISTAKES, IN MANY CASES BY SURNAME,
GIVEN NAME AND PATRONYMIC. ON THE BASIS OF AN ANALYSIS
OF DATA FROM NUMEROUS OBSERVATIONS BY ROD EXPERTS, THE
SECRET OF HOW THE ZIONISTS RECOGNIZE EACH OTHER BY SURNAME, GIVEN NAME, AND PATRONYMIC HAS BEEN REVEALED,

PRESS, BROADCASTS OF THE &quot;VOICE OF AMERICA,&quot; &quot;VOICE OF

OF ROD.
.-----1. THE FORMER HEAD OF THE PARTY AND GOVERNMENT, TRUE
SON OF THE RUSSIAN PEOPLE, N. S. KHRUSCHEV, WAS OVERTHROWN
AS THE RESULT OF A ZIONIST PLOT, IN WHICH CERTAIN RUSSIANS
AND UKRAINIANS BECAME ACCOMPLICES BY VIRTUE OF BEING ILLINFORMED. N. S. KHRUSCHEV WAS THE MOST FEROCIOUS ENEMY OF

3. AFTER THE UNMASKING BY N. S. KHRUSCHEV AT THE XX
CONGRESS OF THE PERSONALITY CULT AND THE CRIMES OF I. V.
STALIN (TENS OF MILLIONS OF ENTIRELY INNOCENT RUSSIANS
AND UKRAINIANS, WERE ELIMINATED, INCLUDING ALL THE
DELEGATES TO THE XVIII CONGRESS) AND THE ABOLITION AT THE
XXII CONGRESS OF THE DICTATORSHIP OF THE PROLETARIAT,
ZIONISTS UNDERSTOOD THAT THEIR ROAD OF RETURN TO TOTAL
SUPREMACY IN THE USSR HAD BEEN CUT FOREVER. THEREFORE,
THEY DECIDED TO DISORGANIZE THE ECONOMY, THUS DEMONSTRATING
ITS UNVIABILITY AND RETURN TO A MIXED ECONOMY INCLUDING
GOVERNMENTAL AND PRIVATE ENTERPRISES. ZIONIST ACADEMICIAN
A. D. SAKHAROV SPOKE OF THE EXPEDIENCY OF SUCH AN
ECONOMY FOR THE USSR IN AN INTERVIEW GIVEN TO A SWEDISH
CORRESPONDENT IN 1974, AND BREZHNEV (SPOKE) ABOUT THE
NEED TO INTRODUCE PRIVATE ENTERPRISE AT THE SESSION OF THE
SUPREME SOVIET OF THE USSR, IN DEFENDING CHAPTER 17 OF THE
CONSTITUTION, PERMITTING PRIVATE BUSINESS UNDERTAKINGS
(CHASTNOE PREDPRINIMATELSTVO). SUCH AN ECONOMY WOULD
PERMIT THE JEWS TO MAKE USE OF (PUSTIT' V OBOROT) THE
HUGE CAPITAL THEY HAVE DISHONESTLY ACCUMULATED AND TO
EXPLOIT THE RUSSIAN AND UKRAINIAN PEOPLES. HAVING CON-

IMPORTANT DECISIONS DF THE XXII CONGRESS WERE DISCREDITED.

THE DECISIONS OF THE XXI CONGRESS WERE COMPLETELY IGNORED
ABOUT DECISIVELY TERMINATING THE PRACTICE OF DISPERSING
CAPITAL INVESTMENT AMONG NUMEROUS CONSTRUCTION SITES AND
PROJECTS. AT PRESENT IN THE COUNTRY, MORE THAN 175,000
CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS ARE BEING BUILT. THE PERIOD OF TIME
REQUIRED FOR CONSTRUCTION OF A PROJECT IS 6-10 YEARS.
SAYANO-SHUSHENSKAYA HYDRO-ELECTRIC STATION HAS BEEN UNDER
CONSTRUCTION FOR 16 YEARS, BUT TO DATE ONLY ONE UNIT HAS
BEGUN TO OPERATE. THE KIEV HYDRO-ELECTRIC STATION IS
COMPLETELY INACTIVE, AS A RESULT TENS OF BILLIONS OF
NATIONAL FUNDS HAVE BEEN THROWN TO THE WINDS, NOT TO SPEAK
OF THE HARM FROM RESETTLEMENT OF MANY TENS OF VILLAGES
AND THE FLOODING OF THOUSANDS OF HECTARS OF FERTILE LAND.
ONE KM. OF THE BAM EXCEEDS THE ESTIMATES BY TENS OF
TIMES. THE ECONOMIC EXPEDIENCY OF THE BAM BEING UNDERTAKEN AT A DISTANCE OF 200-300 KM FROM THE
TRANS-SIBERIAN RAILWAY IS VERY DUBIOUS. IT WOULD HAVE BEEN
EXPEDIENT AT THE BEGINNING TO BUILD A RAILWAY TO THE
INCALCULABLE RICHES OF YAKUTSK AND ONLY AFTER EXPLOITING
THEM, MIGHT IT HAVE BEEN EXPEDIENT TO PROCEED WITH THE
CONSTRUCTION OF BAM FROM POPULATED CENTERS. THE INVULNERABILITY OF BAM IN THE EVENT OF A WAR WITH CHINA, AS
THE ZIONISTS SAY, WHILE PREPARING TO UNLEASH THAT WAR,
CANNOT BE ASSURED IN THE LIGHTOF CONTEMPORARY ROCKET/
NUCLEAR WEAPONS. THE RESOLUTION TAKEN UNDER KHRUSCHEV
CONCERNING THE RECONSTRUCTION OF VILLAGES AND THE CONSTRUCTION OF CULTURAL CENTERS THERE HAS BEEN IGNORED, AS
HAS THE DECISION ABOUT THE MECHANIZATION OF LABORINTENSIVE PROCESSES IN AGRICULTURE, WITH THE RESULT THAT A
LARGE PART OF THE YOUTH HAVE GONE TO THE TOWNS, AND MANY
RURAL INHABITANTS GO TENS OF KILOMETERS FROM THEIR
VILLAGES TO PURSUE THEIR FARMING WORK. THE SOVNARKHOZES,
WHICH WERE AN EFFECTIVE FORM OF DECENTRALIZED DIRECTION

PERMITTED THE ZIONISTS TO INSTALL THEIR PEOPLE IN LEADING
POSTS AND TO COORDINATE THEIR SUBVERSIVE ACTIVITY. THE
PROGRESSIVE &quot;NEW SYSTEM OF ECONOMIC PLANNING AND
MATERIAL STIMULATION&quot; WORKED OUT BY A. N. KOSYGIN WAS

EMASCULATED AT FIRST BY THE ZIONISTS AND AFTER ITS
ADOPTION, DISCREDITED. THERE ARE MANY SIMILAR
EXAMPLES, (BUT) BECAUSE OF THE LIMITED FORMAT WE CANNOT
ADDUCE THEM ALL.
4. HAVING TAKEN THE ARMY AND KGB UNDER THEIR CONTROL,
THE KREMLIN ZIONISTS BEGAN TO DRIVE OUT THE RUSSIANS AND
UKRANIANS FROM KEY POSTS IN THE ECONOMY, GOVERNMENT
APPARATUS, AND PARTY APPARATUS. IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO
ENUMERATE ALL OF THE VICTIMS OF THIS ZIONIST CAMPAIGN;
THEREFORE, WE WILL DWELL ON THE MOST POWERFUL.
THE DAUGHTER OF THE RUSSIAN PEOPLE, E. A. FURTSEVA,
WAS DISPATCHED BY BREZHNEV HIMSELF, DRIVING HER TO A HEART
ATTACK IN HIS OWN OFFICE AFTER WHICH SHE QUICKLY
(24 OCT. 74) DIED. THE TRUE SON OF THE UKRAINIAN PEOPLE,
P. E. SHELEST, WAS OVERWHELMED THROUGH USE OF THE WELLTRIED ZIONIST WEAPON -- ACCUSATION OF NATIONALISM, AND
THROUGH ANOTHER ADROIT MANEUVER, WAS TRANSFERRED TO A NEW
POST IN MOSCOW AND QUICKLY AFTERWARDS PUT OUT ON PENSION,
DESPITE HIS VIGOROUS HEALTH. TO DISCREDIT THE TRUE SON

A DISCREDIT TO THE PARTY. AFTER THIS, IT BECAME CLEAR
TO A. N. SHELEPIN AND MANY SHARING HIS VIEWS THAT THE
ZIONISTS WERE SEATED IN THE KREMLIN.
THE UKRAINIAN D. S. POLYNSKY WAS EXPELLED FROM THE
POLITBURO AT THE 25TH CONGRESS, HAVING BEEN MADE A
SCAPEGOAT FOR FAILURES IN AGRICULTURE, WHERE HE HONESTLY
CARRIED OUT THE DECISIONS OF THE PLENUM AND THE PERSONAL
ORDERS OF BREZHNEV. THE UKRAINIAN SON, N. V. PODGORNIY,
WAS UNACCEPTABLE TO THE ZIONISTS FOR TWO REASONS. FIRST,
HE STEADFASTLY OPPOSED THE EXCLUSION OF THE MENTION OF
&quot;NATIONALITY&quot; FROM THE NEW PASSPORTS AND INTRODUCED AN
EDUCATION TAX ON JEWS LEAVING THE USSR; SECONDLY, THE
KREMLIN ZIONISTS DECIDED TO TAKE INTO THEIR HANDS THE POST
OF HEAD OF GOVERNMENT. IN ORDER TO DISCREDIT N. V.
PODGORNIY, THE KREMLIN ZIONISTS, KNOWING HIS POSITION
WITH REGARD TO AFRICAN COUNTRIES, ARRANGED A TRIP FOR HIM

MENTS SIGNED WITH THEM WHICH WERE NOT IN THE INTEREST OF THE
KREMLIN ZIONISTS, AND WHICH GAVE THEM A WAY TO JUSTIFY HIS
EXPULSION FROM THE POLITBURO AND HIS REMOVAL FROM THE
POST OF HEAD OF STATE.
5. A DECISION WAS TAKEN TO ELIMINATE THE DESIGNATION
&quot;NATIONALITY&quot; FROM PASSPORTS. FOR THIS L. I. BREZHNEV,
AT THE 24TH CONGRESS, HAD ADVANCED THE THESIS OF THE
APPEARANCE OF A NEW HISTORIC CATEGORY OF PEOPLE (IN ONLY
A HALF CENTURY, INSTEAD OF MANY THOUSANDS, JUST THINK OF
IT*), WHICH WAS USED AS A THEORETICAL BASIS FOR WORKING
OUT A NEW PASSPORT WITHOUT A SPACE FOR &quot;NATIONALITY.&quot;
HOWEVER, THE RESOLUTE OBJECTIONS OF N. V. PODGORNIY,
A. N. SHELEPIN, A. N. KOSYGIN, M. A. SUSLOV, G. V.
ROMANOV, P. E. SHELEST, AND MANY OTHER DEPUTIES, ON THE
OCCASION OF THE APPROVAL OF THE PROJECT OF A NEW PASSPORT
BY THE SUPREME SOVIET, PREVENTED THE KREMLIN ZIONISTS
FROM CARRYING OUT THEIR INSIDIOUS SCHEME.
6. THE MOVEMENT OF THE JEWISH INTELLIGENTSIA FOR
SO-CALLED HUMAN RIGHTS DEVELOPED WITHTHE FULL APPROVAL
AND SECRET SUPPORT OF THE KREMLIN ZIONISTS, AND IN MOST
RECENT TIMES ALSO THE MOVEMENT OF THE WRETCHED STRATA OF
JEWISH WORKERS FOR THE NOTORIOUS INDEPENDENT TRADE UNION.
FOR THE PURPOSE OF LEGALIZING THIS MOVEMENT AND PROVIDING
IT WITH INTERNATIONAL SUPPORT, THE KREMLIN ZIONISTS,
TOGETHER WITH THE ZIONISTS OF THE WEST, ORGANIZED THE
HELSINKI CONFERENCE ON SECURITY AND COOPERATION IN EUROPE.
ALTHOUGH THE FINAL ACT OF THE CONFERENCE DOES NOT HAVE

MOVEMENT IN THE USSR AND GOVERNMENT LEADERS (ZIONISTS)
OF CERTAIN COUNTRIES TO INTERFERE UNCEREMONIOUSLY IN THE
INTERNAL AFFAIRS OF THE USSR. IN THE RECENT POSTHELSINKI CONFERENCE PERIOD, THE TRUE AIM OF THE CONFERENCE HAS APPEARED CLEARLY. THE COUNRIES WHICH SIGNED
THE FINAL ACT, HAVE PRINCIPALLY BROUGHT INTO FORCE ITS
THIRD CHAPTER, ABANDONING THEIR PREVIOUS LEVEL OF
COOPERATION. AT THE 24TH SESSION OF NATO, THE PARLIAMENTARIANS OF THESE COUNTRIES SUPPORTED THE ARMS RACE,
BASING THEMSELVES ON THE MYTH OF THE SOVIET THREAT,
REVEALING BY THIS FACT THE TRUE GOAL OF THE CONFERENCE
IN HELSINKI. AFTER FIGHTERS FOR HUMAN RIGHTS IN MOSCOW
IN 1977 ORGANIZED A SERIES OF TERRORIST ACTS, THE KREMLIN
ZIONISTS WERE OBLIGED BY THE PRESSURE OF PUBLIC OPINION
TO TAKE ACTIVE MEASURES AGAINST THEM, CONDUCTING A SERIES
OF SHOW TRIALS AGAINST WELL-KNOWN MEMBERS OF THE JEWISH
MOVEMENT IN THE USSR.

THE IDEA THAT, AS UNDER STALIN, IT WOULD BE NEDITION OF &quot;THE FLAG OF
DZERZHINSKY.&quot; DURING THE DAYS OF THE CONGRESS, BREZHNEV
CRUDELY VIOLATED THE RULES OF THE PARTY, RECEIVING HEADS OF
DELEGATIONS AS SECRETARY GENERAL. AFTER THE CONGRESS, ALL
OF THE MASS MEDIA OF THE COUNTRY WITH THE VOICE OF ZIONISTS
BEGAN TO TRUMPET THE PRAISES OF BREZHNEV. THE WALLS OF
BUILDINGS WERE &quot;DECORATED&quot; WITH HUGE PORTRAITS OF BREZHNEV
AND HIS &quot;WISE SAYINGS.&quot; WITHIN A BRIEF PERIOD BREZHNEV
ACCOMPLISHES TENS OF HEROIC FEATS AND BECOMES TWICE HERO
OF CZECHOSLOVAKIA, TWICE BULGARIA, TWICE GDR, TWICE
POLAND AND OTHER COUNTRIES. ZIONIST KURT WALDHEIM GAVE
BREZHNEV A UN MEDAL. ON THE EVE OF HIS 70TH BIRTHDAY,
BREZHNEV AWARDED HIMSELF A SECOND HERO STAR, AAPARENTLY FOR
VICTORY OVER A. N. SHELEPIN. IN PEACE TIME, HE CREATES
A DEFENSE COMMITTEE AND ILLEGALLY MAKES HIMSELF ITS CHAIRMAN. HE AWARDS HIMSELF THE TITLE OF MARSHAL OF THE SOVIET
UNION AND WRITES HIS BIOGRAPHY WHICH, WITH THE HELP OF
FOREIGN ZIONIST PUBLISHERS,POSITION. IN THIS WAY, HE WAS ABLE
TO PLAY ON THE

CHINA, BOASTFULLY DECLARING THAT THE RUSSIAN AND UKRANIAN
PEOPLE WILL ALWAYS BE UNDER THE YOKE, IF NOT OF THE JEWS,
THEN OF THE CHINESE. MAO TSE-TUNG AND THE BAND OF FOUR
ARE CHINESE ZIONISTS. TENG HSIAO-PING AND HIS SUPPORTERS ARE HONEST
CHINESE. ON ONE OF THE WALL POSTERS IT WAS SAID THAT NOT ALL OF THE
SUPPORTERS OF THE BAND OF FOUR HAVE BEEN DRIVCEN FROM THE GOVERNMENT
AND THEY CONTINUE TO OCCUPY HIGH POSITIONS. EVIDENTLY THEY HAD IN
MIND THE CHAIRMAN OF THE PARTY HUA KUO-FENG, MINISTER OF FOREIGN
AFFAIRS KUAN-HUA AND OTHERS, WHO ARE ZIONISTS. THE TRUE
RELATIONSHIP OF FRIENDLY RELATIONS WITH THE USSR TO THE
THE FULLEST EXTENT WAS DEMANDED. IT IS IMPORTANT ALWAYS
TO REMEMBER THIS. USA PRESIDENT, THE ENGLISHMAN JAMES
CARTER, HAVING COMPREHENDED THE INSIDIOUS SCHEMES OF THE
ZIONISTS, BREAKS DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS WITH THE REPUBLIC
OF TAIWAN AND ESTABLISHES THEM IN FULL MEASURE WITH CHINA,
WHICH AROUSED A STORM OF INDIGNATION AMONG AMERICAN ZIONISTS LEAD BY GOLDWATER. THE ZIONISTS UNDERSTOOD THAT, BY
THIS ACT, JAMES CARTER IN PRACTICAL TERMS ALMOST REDUCED
TO NOTHING THE POSSIBILITY OF A DIRECT ATTACK BY THE USSR
ON CHINA. SEEING THIS TURN OF EVENTS, THE KREMLIN ZIONISTS
QUICKLY CONCLUDE A TREATY OF FRIENDSHIP AND COOPERATION
WITH VIETNAM (THERE THE ZIONISTS ARE ALSO IN
CONTROL OVER THE PARTY AND GOVERNMENT, OCCUPYING KEY
POSITIONS) AND GIVE VIET NAM AN ORDER TO UNDERTAKE PROVOCATIONS ON THE BORDER WITH CHINA AND CAMBODIA (SIC.), TO
CARRY OUT AN INVASION BY VIET NAM INTO CAMBODIA AND BY

NO ONE PREVENTED THE ZIONISTS FROM SEIZING COMMANDING
POSITIONS IN PARTY AND STATE.&quot; LATER, AFTER SOME REFLECTION AND REMEMBERING THE LAST NAMES OF THE ABOVE MENTIONED
ZIONISTS, YOU YOURSELF CAN GIVE THE ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION
- ZIONISTS, HAVING PENETRATED TO POWER, ARE HIDDEN FROM
VIEW PUTTING THEMSELVES FORWARD AS RUSSIANS, UKRAINIANS,
BYELORUSSIANS AND OTHER NATIONALITIES. AFTER THIS, YOU
WILL NATURALLY ASK, &quot;HOW CAN A DISGUISED ZIONIST BE
DISTINGUISHED?&quot; THE ANSWER TO THIS QUESTION AT FIRST GLANCE
MIGHT SEEM TO BE EASY FOR MANY OF YOU, WHO THINK YOU CAN
DISTINGUISH THEM BY THEIR FACES AND FIGURES. HOWEVER,
IN PRACTICE IT IS NOT ALWAYS POSSIBLE TO DO THIS,
ESPECIALLY FOR ZIONISTS FROM MIXED MARRIAGES. NEVERTHELESS
ZIONISTS WILL ALMOST ALWAYS BE ABLE TO RECOGNIZE ONE
ANOTHER WITHOUT MISTAKES, IN MANY CASES BY SURNAME,
GIVEN NAME AND PATRONYMIC. ON THE BASIS OF AN ANALYSIS
OF DATA FROM NUMEROUS OBSERVATIONS BY ROD EXPERTS, THE
SECRET OF HOW THE ZIONISTS RECOGNIZE EACH OTHER BY SURNAME, GIVEN NAME, AND PATRONYMIC HAS BEEN REVEALED,
WHICH IS AS FOLLOWS: 1) RUSSIAN AND UKRAINIAN SURNAMES
