		<h3>Tor</h3>
		<p><a href="https://www.torproject.org">Tor</a> is an encrypted anonymising network that makes it harder to intercept internet communications, or see where communications are coming from or going to.</p>
		<p>In order to use the WikiLeaks public submission system as detailed above you can download the Tor Browser Bundle, which is a Firefox-like browser available for Windows, Mac OS X and GNU/Linux and pre-configured to connect using the anonymising system Tor.</p>
		<h4>Tails</h4>
		<p>If you are at high risk and you have the capacity to do so, you can also access the submission system through a secure operating system called <a href="https://tails.boum.org">Tails</a>. Tails is an operating system launched from a USB stick or a DVD that aim to leaves no traces when the computer is shut down after use and automatically routes your internet traffic through Tor. Tails will require you to have either a USB stick or a DVD at least 4GB big and a laptop or desktop computer.</p>

		<h3>Tips</h3>
		<p>Our submission system works hard to preserve your anonymity, but we recommend you also take some of your own precautions. Please review these basic guidelines. </p>
		<div>
			<h4>1. Contact us if you have specific problems</h4>
			<p>If you have a very large submission, or a submission with a complex format, or are a high-risk source, please <a href="#submit_help_contact">contact us</a>. In our experience it is always possible to find a custom solution for even the most seemingly difficult situations.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h4>2. What computer to use</h4>
			<p>If the computer you are uploading from could subsequently be audited in an investigation, consider using a computer that is not easily tied to you. Technical users can also use <a href="https://tails.boum.org">Tails</a> to help ensure you do not leave any records of your submission on the computer.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h4>3. Do not talk about your submission to others</h4>
			<p>If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in source protection – it is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This includes other media organisations.</p>
		</div>

	</div>

		<h3>After</h3>

		<div>
			<h4>1. Do not talk about your submission to others</h4>
			<p>If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in source protection – it is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This includes other media organisations.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h4>2. Act normal</h4>
			<p>If you are a high-risk source, avoid saying anything or doing anything after submitting which might promote suspicion. In particular, you should try to stick to your normal routine and behaviour.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h4>3. Remove traces of your submission</h4>
			<p>If you are a high-risk source and the computer you prepared your submission on, or uploaded it from, could subsequently be audited in an investigation, we recommend that you format and dispose of the computer hard drive and any other storage media you used.</p>
			<p>In particular, hard drives retain data after formatting which may be visible to a digital forensics team and flash media (USB sticks, memory cards and SSD drives) retain data even after a secure erasure. If you used flash media to store sensitive data, it is important to destroy the media.</p>
			<p>If you do this and are a high-risk source you should make sure there are no traces of the clean-up, since such traces themselves may draw suspicion.</p>
			<div>
				<h4>4. If you face legal action</h4>
				<p>If a legal action is brought against you as a result of your submission, there are organisations that may help you. The Courage Foundation is an international organisation dedicated to the protection of journalistic sources. You can find more details at <a href="https://www.couragefound.org">https://www.couragefound.org</a>.</p>

		<p>WikiLeaks publishes documents of political or historical importance that are censored or otherwise suppressed. We specialise in strategic global publishing and large archives.</p>
		<p>The following is the address of our secure site where you can anonymously upload your documents to WikiLeaks editors. You can only access this submissions system through Tor. (See our <a href="#submit_help_tor">Tor tab</a> for more information.) We also advise you to read our <a href="#submit_help_tips">tips for sources</a> before submitting.</p>

			<!--<div>
				Copy this address into your Tor browser. Advanced users, if they wish, can also add a further layer of encryption to their submission using <a href="#submit_wlkey">our public PGP key</a>.
			</div>-->
		</div>

		<p>If you cannot use Tor, or your submission is very large, or you have specific requirements, WikiLeaks provides several alternative methods. <a href="#submit_help_contact">Contact us</a> to discuss how to proceed.</p>

NEW ASIAN DYNASTY IN THE STALINIST ATMOSPHERE OF
PYONGYANG. &quot;IF YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND THE SUCCESSION ISSUE,
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND NORTH KOREA,&quot; IS THE WAY ONE ANALYST

THAT THE PRECEPTS OF THEIR &quot;WISE AND BELOVED LEADER&quot;
CONTINUE ON &quot;FROM GENERATION TO GENERATION.&quot; CERTAINLY THE
SUCCESSION OF KIM JONG IL WILL ASSURE THIS. THE CULT OF
KIM IL SUNG HAS ALWAYS BEEN OVERWHELMING. SINCE EARLY
'70S, OR ABOUT THE TIME THAT KIM JONG IL WAS 1ST BEING
BROUGHT CLOSE TO THE SEATS OF POWER, THE CULT HAS TAKEN
ON A NEW DIMENSION. ONE SIDE EFFECT OF THE CULT IS TO
GIVE THE IMPRESSION THAT KIM JONG IL WAS BORN ON KOREAN
SOIL, BUT WESTERN ANALYSTS THINK THE TRUTH IS THAT HE
WAS BORN IN THE SOVIET UNION. IN NK'S PRESENT

ATMOSPHERE OF FERVID NATIONALISM, FOREIGN BIRTH WOULD
BE AN ALMOST FATAL POL HANDICAP. IN HIS RAPID RISE TO
THE TOP, KIM JONG IL ECLIPSED HIS UNCLE, KIM YONG CHU,
THE PRESIDENT'S YOUNGER BROTHER AND THE MAN MOST
ANALYSTS THOUGHT WAS THE DESIGNATED SUCCESSOR. THERE
IS CONSENSUS THAT KIM IL SUNG IS FACING CONSIDERABLE
DOMESTIC OPPOSITION IN HAVING HIS SON ANOINTED AS HIS
SUCCESSOR. THE CULT OF AN INFALLIBLE KIM IL SUNG AND THE
EMERGING MYTH OF THE DYNASTY COME ACROSS TO THE OUTSIDE
WORLD AS OFTEN BIZARRE, FREQUENTLY FATUOUS AND GENERALLY
IRRELEVANT. YET THE KIM IL SUNG CULT CANNOT BE DISMISSED
AS A SIMPLE ABERRATION, A MERE FIGMENT OF PYONGYANG'S
PROPAGANDA APPARATUS. PROF KIM OF GEORGE WASHINGTON U
CAME AWAY FROM HIS VISITS TO NK SURPRISED AT THE
SINCERITY HE DETECTED AMONG INDIVIDUALS WHO SPOKE OF THEIR
RESPECT FOR KIM IL SUNG. EVEN ALLOWING FOR THE FACT THAT
MOST OF THE PEOPLE HE MET WERE MIDDLE-LEVEL OFFICIALS
WITH A STAKE IN THE SYSTEM, PROF KIM WAS IMPRESSED.

STORIES. IT REPORTS MASSIVE HUMAN RTS VIOLATIONS AGAINST
DISSIDENTS, REPRESSION OF CHINESE MINORITIES, MISUSE OF
EDUCATED PEOPLE, ALL DURING THE ASCENDENCY OF THE GANG

ABROAD FOR POSSIBLE CONTAMINATION. BY '85, CHINA EXPECTS
TO HAVE 20,000 STUDENTS OVERSEAS, ABOUT 5,000 IN US.
THE AIM, IN THE WORDS OF &quot;FEER&quot; IS &quot;REPLACING A LOST
GENERATION.&quot; THE US IS THE COUNTRY PRC NEEDS MOST. US
RECOGNITION OF TAIWAN AND DEFENSE COMMITMENTS TO IT ARE THE
OBSTACLES TO NORMALIZATION W/PEKING. WASHINGTON SHOULD BE
AWARE THAT LEVERAGE IS SHIFTING ITS WAY. RECOGNITION
SHOULD BECOME POSSIBLE ON TERMS THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN UNTHINKABLE RECENTLY. MEANWHILE, NORMALIZATION IS POSSIBLE
IN EVERYTHING BUT NAME. CHINA IS BECOMING MORE REASONABLE,
AND SO SHOULD ITS CONDITIONS FOR FULL RECOGNITION, THE
EDIT SAYS.
A NEWS ANALYSIS BY TELFER (JOC) STATES EXPLOSION OF
DISCUSSIONS AND DEALS W/CHINA IS OCCURRING AS PRC TURNS
INCREASINGLY TO THE WEST/JAPAN FOR TECHNOLOGY AND GOODS

RESOURCES AND SOME MANUFACTURES--MOSTLY TRADITIONAL ITEMS.

PRES KIM IL SUNG AND MARXISM'S FIRST CROWN PRINCE, HAS HELD
A NUMBER OF KEY POSTS, USUALLY ONES THAT PUT HIM IN A
POSITION TO INSURE THAT THERE WOULD BE NO CHALLENGE TO THE
POWER AND AUTHORITY OF PRESIDENT. SHARKEY SAYS THAT TO
THE DISMAY OF OTHER SOCIALIST STATES, PARTICULARLY THE
SOVIET UNION, THE WORLD IS WITNESSING THE CREATION OF A

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
NEW ASIAN DYNASTY IN THE STALINIST ATMOSPHERE OF
PYONGYANG. &quot;IF YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND THE SUCCESSION ISSUE,
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND NORTH KOREA,&quot; IS THE WAY ONE ANALYST
PUTS IT. THE NORTH KOREAN PEOPLE HAVE BEEN EX ORTED TO SEE
THAT THE PRECEPTS OF THEIR &quot;WISE AND BELOVED LEADER&quot;
CONTINUE ON &quot;FROM GENERATION TO GENERATION.&quot; CERTAINLY THE
SUCCESSION OF KIM JONG IL WILL ASSURE THIS. THE CULT OF
KIM IL SUNG HAS ALWAYS BEEN OVERWHELMING. SINCE EARLY
'70S, OR ABOUT THE TIME THAT KIM JONG IL WAS 1ST BEING
BROUGHT CLOSE TO THE SEATS OF POWER, THE CULT HAS TAKEN
ON A NEW DIMENSION. ONE SIDE EFFECT OF THE CULT IS TO
GIVE THE IMPRESSION THAT KIM JONG IL WAS BORN ON KOREAN
SOIL, BUT WESTERN ANALYSTS THINK THE TRUTH IS THAT HE
WAS BORN IN THE SOVIET UNION. IN NK'S PRESENT

STATE 261774

ATMOSPHERE OF FERVID NATIONALISM, FOREIGN BIRTH WOULD
BE AN ALMOST FATAL POL HANDICAP. IN HIS RAPID RISE TO
THE TOP, KIM JONG IL ECLIPSED HIS UNCLE, KIM YONG CHU,
THE PRESIDENT'S YOUNGER BROTHER AND THE MAN MOST
ANALYSTS THOUGHT WAS THE DESIGNATED SUCCESSOR. THERE
IS CONSENSUS THAT KIM IL SUNG IS FACING CONSIDERABLE
DOMESTIC OPPOSITION IN HAVING HIS SON ANOINTED AS HIS
SUCCESSOR. THE CULT OF AN INFALLIBLE KIM IL SUNG AND THE
EMERGING MYTH OF THE DYNASTY COME ACROSS TO THE OUTSIDE
WORLD AS OFTEN BIZARRE, FREQUENTLY FATUOUS AND GENERALLY
IRRELEVANT. YET THE KIM IL SUNG CULT CANNOT BE DISMISSED
AS A SIMPLE ABERRATION, A MERE FIGMENT OF PYONGYANG'S
PROPAGANDA APPARATUS. PROF KIM OF GEORGE WASHINGTON U
CAME AWAY FROM HIS VISITS TO NK SURPRISED AT THE
SINCERITY HE DETECTED AMONG INDIVIDUALS WHO SPOKE OF THEIR
RESPECT FOR KIM IL SUNG. EVEN ALLOWING FOR THE FACT THAT
MOST OF THE PEOPLE HE MET WERE MIDDLE-LEVEL OFFICIALS
WITH A STAKE IN THE SYSTEM, PROF KIM WAS IMPRESSED.
