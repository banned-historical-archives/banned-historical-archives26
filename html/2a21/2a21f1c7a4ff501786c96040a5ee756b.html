		<h3>Tor</h3>
		<p><a href="https://www.torproject.org">Tor</a> is an encrypted anonymising network that makes it harder to intercept internet communications, or see where communications are coming from or going to.</p>
		<p>In order to use the WikiLeaks public submission system as detailed above you can download the Tor Browser Bundle, which is a Firefox-like browser available for Windows, Mac OS X and GNU/Linux and pre-configured to connect using the anonymising system Tor.</p>
		<h4>Tails</h4>
		<p>If you are at high risk and you have the capacity to do so, you can also access the submission system through a secure operating system called <a href="https://tails.boum.org">Tails</a>. Tails is an operating system launched from a USB stick or a DVD that aim to leaves no traces when the computer is shut down after use and automatically routes your internet traffic through Tor. Tails will require you to have either a USB stick or a DVD at least 4GB big and a laptop or desktop computer.</p>

		<h3>Tips</h3>
		<p>Our submission system works hard to preserve your anonymity, but we recommend you also take some of your own precautions. Please review these basic guidelines. </p>
		<div>
			<h4>1. Contact us if you have specific problems</h4>
			<p>If you have a very large submission, or a submission with a complex format, or are a high-risk source, please <a href="#submit_help_contact">contact us</a>. In our experience it is always possible to find a custom solution for even the most seemingly difficult situations.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h4>2. What computer to use</h4>
			<p>If the computer you are uploading from could subsequently be audited in an investigation, consider using a computer that is not easily tied to you. Technical users can also use <a href="https://tails.boum.org">Tails</a> to help ensure you do not leave any records of your submission on the computer.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h4>3. Do not talk about your submission to others</h4>
			<p>If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in source protection – it is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This includes other media organisations.</p>
		</div>

	</div>

		<h3>After</h3>

		<div>
			<h4>1. Do not talk about your submission to others</h4>
			<p>If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in source protection – it is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This includes other media organisations.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h4>2. Act normal</h4>
			<p>If you are a high-risk source, avoid saying anything or doing anything after submitting which might promote suspicion. In particular, you should try to stick to your normal routine and behaviour.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h4>3. Remove traces of your submission</h4>
			<p>If you are a high-risk source and the computer you prepared your submission on, or uploaded it from, could subsequently be audited in an investigation, we recommend that you format and dispose of the computer hard drive and any other storage media you used.</p>
			<p>In particular, hard drives retain data after formatting which may be visible to a digital forensics team and flash media (USB sticks, memory cards and SSD drives) retain data even after a secure erasure. If you used flash media to store sensitive data, it is important to destroy the media.</p>
			<p>If you do this and are a high-risk source you should make sure there are no traces of the clean-up, since such traces themselves may draw suspicion.</p>
			<div>
				<h4>4. If you face legal action</h4>
				<p>If a legal action is brought against you as a result of your submission, there are organisations that may help you. The Courage Foundation is an international organisation dedicated to the protection of journalistic sources. You can find more details at <a href="https://www.couragefound.org">https://www.couragefound.org</a>.</p>

		<p>WikiLeaks publishes documents of political or historical importance that are censored or otherwise suppressed. We specialise in strategic global publishing and large archives.</p>
		<p>The following is the address of our secure site where you can anonymously upload your documents to WikiLeaks editors. You can only access this submissions system through Tor. (See our <a href="#submit_help_tor">Tor tab</a> for more information.) We also advise you to read our <a href="#submit_help_tips">tips for sources</a> before submitting.</p>

			<!--<div>
				Copy this address into your Tor browser. Advanced users, if they wish, can also add a further layer of encryption to their submission using <a href="#submit_wlkey">our public PGP key</a>.
			</div>-->
		</div>

		<p>If you cannot use Tor, or your submission is very large, or you have specific requirements, WikiLeaks provides several alternative methods. <a href="#submit_help_contact">Contact us</a> to discuss how to proceed.</p>

VICE MINISTER WANG HAI-JUNG: WELCOME. TODAY, BECAUSE OF THE
SUDDEN EARTHQUAKE THAT OCCURRED THIS MORNING, THERE WAS UNEASI-
NESS CAUSED AMONG OUR FRIENDS. ARE YOU AFRAID NOW?
CONFIDENTIAL

PAGE 03        PEKING 01430  01 OF 03  291132Z

CZARNECKI: AT 3:45 THIS MORNING WE WERE.

WANG: BUT NOT NOW?

CZARNECKI: NO.

WANG: THE EPICENTER WAS AT A PLACE 150 KMS. TO THE SOUTHEAST OF
PEKING. IT REGISTERED 7.4 ON THE RICHTER SCALE. ACCORDING TO THE
GENERAL LAW OF EARTHQUAKES, NORMALLY AFTER THE QUAKE THERE
AFTER-SHOCKS, TODAY, TOMORROW AND THE FOLLOWING DAY. BUT THE
DEPARTMENTS CONCERNED RESPONSIBLE FOR RESEARCH AND PREDICTIONS
WILL LET YOU KNOW AS SOON AS WE HAVE ANY INFORMATION. THE HOST
ORGANIZATION WILL LET YOU KNOW WHEN WE TRULY KNOW. THERE IS NO
NEED TO BE AFRAID. WHERE DO EARTHQUAKES TAKE PLACE MOST FREQUENTLY
IN THE UNITED STATES?

WANG: GENERALLY SPEAKING, WHAT IS THE DEGREE ON THE RICHTER SCALE?

CZARNECKI: I HAVE TO DEFER TO MY FRIEND FROM CALIFORNIA, MR.
LIEBERTHAL.

LIEBERTHAL: I REALLY DON'T KNOW, OVER 6.

HOLT: EVERYTHING IS BIGGER IN CHINA.

WANG: NOT NECESSARILY. THERE HAVE ALSO BEEN MINOR TREMORS, SOME
HAVE BEEN 4 PLUS, SOME HAVE BEEN 5 PLUS. THIS TIME THE EPICENTER
WAS CLOSER TO PEKING, ONLY 150 KMS. TO THE SOUTHEAST. WE FELT IT,
THE TRMOR, MORE THIS TIME. WHAT VIEWS DO THE FRIENDS FROM THE
WESTERN HEMISPHERE HAVE?

CZARNECKI: MADAME VICE FOREIGN MINISTER, LET ME FIRST EXPRESS TO
YOU OUR APPRECIATEION FOR LETTING US MEET WITH YOU, ESPECIALLY IN
VIEW OF THIS MORNING'S EVENTS. ON BEHALF OF MY COLLEAGUES, LET
ME EXPRESS OUR SYMPATHIES TO THE CHINESE PEOPLE WHO MAY HAVE BEEN
HURT AND TO OUR CHINESE HOSTS, WHO HAVE SHOWN GREAT COURAGE AND
GREAT CONCERN FOR OUR HEALTH STARTING FROM VERY EARLY THIS MORNING.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

WANG: BUT YOU ARE OUR FRIENDS WHO HAVE COME TO VISIT OUR COUNTRY.
CONFIDENTIAL

PAGE 04        PEKING 01430  01 OF 03  291132Z

THIS IS OUR OBLIGATION.

CZARNECKI: YOU ARE VERY KIND. WE HAVE MANY ISSUES WHICH WE WOULD
LIKE TO DISCUSS WITH YOU. WITH YOUR PERMISSION I WOULD LIKE TO
LEAD OFF WITH A GENERAL QUESTION, THEN ALLOW MY COLLEAGUES TO ASK
THEIR OWN PERSONAL QUESTIONS.

WANG: ALL RIGHT.

CZARNECKI: I THINK ALL OF US ARE OF THE SAME MIND. WE ARE LOOKING
FORWARD TO AND HOPING FOR A CONTINUATION AND AN INCREASE IN GOOD AND
BETTER RELATIONS WITH CHINA. ONE AREA THAT IS VERY VITAL TO BOTH
COUNTRIES IS ASIA, THE PERIPHERY ESPECIALLY OF ASIA. WHAT IS YOUR
GOVERNMENT'S PERCEPTION OF THE PROPER AND CONSTRUCTIVE ROLE FOR THE
UNITED STATES IN TERMS OF POLITICAL, DIPLOMATIC, MILITARY AND
ECONOMIC INTERESTS IN ALL REGIONS STRETCHING FROM THE INDIAN
OCEAN TO JAPAN AND THE PACIFIC REGION? WHAT IS THE VIEW OF THE
CHINESE GOVERNMENT?

WANG: THIS IS VERY DIFFICULT FOR US TO ANSWER. THIS A MATTER
WHICH IS THE AFFAIR OF THE UNITED STATES.

CZARNECKI: YET IN MANY PLACES IN THAT PARTICULAR REGION OUR
INTERESTS CONVERGE AND SOMETIMES THEY SEEM TO BE OPPOSED. BUT
LOOKING AT THE LARGER FRAMEWORK OF CONTINUING INTERESTS, WE WONDER
HOW YOU VIEW OUR MILITARY PRESENCE IN SOUTH KOREA.

WANG: OUR POSITION ON KOREA AND OUR STAND IS CONSISTENT AND YOU
UNDERSTAND IT QUITE WELL. IN SOUTH KOREA, OUR STAND IS THAT WE
FAVOR DISSOLUTION OF THE UNITED NATIONS COMMAND AND THAT YOU WITH-
DRAW ALL TROOPS FROM SOUTH KOREA AND THAT THE KOREAN QUESTION BE
LEFT TO THE KOREAN PEOPLE THEMSELVES TO SOLVE AND WE ALSO SUPPORT
THE STAND OF NORTH KOREA FOR INDEPENDENCE AND PEACEFUL REUNIFICATION
OF KOREA. THIS STAND HAS ALWAYS BEEN CONSISTENT. IT IS CLEAR TO
YOU. WE HAVE EXPLAINED IT TO OTHER AMERICAN FRIENDS WHO HAVE
VISITED. TO YOUR PRESIDENT FORD WHEN HE WAS HERE. TO YOUR SECRETARY
OF STATE, DR. HENRY KISSINGER. THIS STAND IS KNOW TO ALL AND LAST
YEAR DURING THE 30TH UNITED NATIONS GENERAL ASSEMBLY OUR FOREIGN
MINISTER ALSO EXPRESSED IT VERY CLEARLY. HE EXPRESSED THE POSITION
OF THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT ON KOREA.

CONFIDENTIAL

PAGE 05        PEKING 01430  01 OF 03  291132Z

CZARNECKI: IN THE CONTEXT OF WHAT YOU HAVE SAID, I WOULD JUDGE
THAT THAT KIND OF PROPOSAL THAT SECRETARY KISSINGER MADE LAST WEEK
FOR DISCUSSIONS THAT WOULD INVOLVE THE UNITED STATES, NORTH KOREA,
SOUTH KOREA AND CHINA WOULD NOT BE VIEWED AS ACHIEVING THE OBJEC-
TIVES THAT YOU HAVE OUTLINED.
(NOTE: AT THIS POINT TING YUAN-HUNG AND TANG WEN-SHENG SIMULTAN-
EOUSLY CORRECTED THE TRANSLATOR)

WANG: NO. WELL, I'M AWARE OF THE PROPOSAL BY SECRETARY OF STATE
DR. HENRY KISSINGER IN HIS SEATTLE SPEECH LAST WEEK. HIS PROPOSAL
WAS NOT AT ALL A NEW ONE. WHAT KIND OF NEW PROPOSAL IS THIS? OUR
STAND ON KOREA IS CLEAR TO YOU ALL.

HOLT: THANK YOU. I'D LIKE TO REPEAT THE WORDS OF APPRECIATION
FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO MEET WITH YOU AND TO EMPHASIZE OUR GRATITUDE
TO OUR HOSTS IN THE CHINESE PEOPLE'S INSTITUTE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS
WHO THIS MORNING TOOK EVERY STEP TO INSURE OUR COMFORT AND SAFEY.
THERE ARE AGREAT MANY THINGS I'D BE INTERESTED IN DISCUSSING WITH
THE VICE MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS, BUT WE HAVE A LARGE GROUP
AND I'VE BEEN TAKING A LOT OF TIME ON THIS TRIP, AND I'D LIKE TO
YIELD TO OTHERS IN THIS GROUP.

WANG: DO THE OTHER FRIENDS HAVE QUESTIONS?

LIEBERTHAL: IN 1973 AT THE TENGTH PARTY CONGRESS, PREMIER CHOU
EN-LAI SAID THAT THE USSR IS FEINTING TO THE EAST, BUT ATTACKING
TO THE WEST; BUT AT THE SAME TIME PREMIER CHOU WARNED AGAINST A
SURPRISE ATTACK. DOES THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT STILL BELIEVE THERE
IS ANY POSSIBILITY OF A SURPRISE ATTACK?

WANG: ARE THERE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS?

STARK: I'D LIKE TO HEAR YOUR VIEWS ON CHINA-JAPAN TRADE RELATIONS

WANG: ANY OTHER QUESTIONS?

MOOSE: I'D LIKE TO HEAR FROM THE VICE FOREIGN MINISTER WHETHER
SHE SEES ANY POLICY ARES, EITHER IN THE FAR EAST OR ELSEWHERE
IN THE WORLD, WHERE SHE BELIEVES THAT THE UNITED STATES AND CHINA
HAVE COMMON INTERESTS OR COULD WORK TOGETHER.

WANG: ARE THERE ANYOTHER QUESTIONS? NO? WELL, IN THAT CASE
LET ME DISCUSS THE CONSISTENT STAND O  CHINA ON SOME OF THE ISSUES.
FIRST, I'D LIKE TO DEAL WITH OUR VIEWS ON QUESTIONS OF THE GENERAL
INTERNATIONAL SITUATION. WE HOLD THAT THE OVERALL INTERNATIONAL
SITUATION CAN BE DESCRIBED AS: THERE IS GREAT CHAOS UNDER HEAVEN,
BUT THE SITUATION IS EXCELLENT. AND TODAY THERE ARE VARIOUS
FUNDAMENTAL CONTRADICTIONS WHICH ARE SHARPENING. THERE IS A
GENERAL TREND. NATIONS WANT INDEPENDENCE, COUNTRIES WANT LIBERA-
TION, PEOPLES WANT REVOLUTION. THIS TREND IS IRREVERSIBLE, THIS
TREND IS IRRESISTIBLE. AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE WORLD SITUATION
IS MIRE AND MORE FAVORABLE TO THE PEOPLE OF THE WORLD. IT IS
BECOMING MORE AND MORE UNFAVORABLE TO IMPERIALISM AND TO REVISIONISM.
THE AWAKENING AND THE HEIGHTENED CONSCIOUSNESS OF THE PEOPLE OF
THE DEVELOPING COUNTRIES ARE BEING HEIGHTENED EVERY DAY. ACCORDING
TO OUR CALCULATIONS, GENERALLY SPEAKING, FOLLOWING THE END OF WORLD
WAR II MORE THAN 80 COUNTRIES HAVE GAINED INDEPENDENCE. OUR VIEW
OF THE GENERAL WORLD SITUATION IS OPTIMISTIC. WE HAVE FAITH IN
OUR VIEW OF THE GENERAL WORLD SITUATION. WHEN THE LATE PREMIER
CHOU AT THE FOURTH NATIONAL PEOPLE'S CONGRESS (HERE TANG WEN-SHENG
BREAKS IN AND CORRECTS, SAYING THE TENTH PARTY CONGRESS) GAVE HIS
REPORT STATING THAT THE SOVIET UNION WOULD FEINT TO THE EAST BUT
CONFIDENTIAL

PAGE 02        PEKING 01430  02 OF 04  292137Z

STRIKE TO THE WEST, HE ALSO INDICATED THAT THE FOCAL POINT OF CON-
TENTION IS IN EUROPE. BUT OUR VIEW IS THAT NO MATTER WHAT THE
SOVIET UNION DOES, ITS SPEARHEAD IS DIRECTED AGAINST YOU, THE UNITED
STATES. ALTHOUGH THE SOVIET UNION HAS DEPLOYED (HEREHRANG WEN-SHENG
BREAKS IN, CORRECTING TO SAY &quot;SOMEONE HAS SAID THAT, ALTHOUGH THE
SOVIET UNION HAS DEPLOYED) ONE MILLION TROOPS ALONG THE SINO-
SOVIET BORDER, WE STILL BELIEVE THAT THE SPEARHEAD IS DIRECTED
AGAINST YOU. IN OUR VIEW, THE POLAR BEAR WANTS TO FIX YOU (CHENG NI)
AND BITE YOU (YAO NI). OF COURSE, THEY ARE FIRST AND FOREMOST
DIRECTED AGAINST THE UNITED STATES. BUT THIS DOES NOT EXCLUDE THE
POSSIBILITY THAT AT THE SAME TIME THEY ARE ALSO DIRECTED AGAINST
US. OUR VIEW IS THAT THEY ARE DIRECTED FIRST AGAINST THE UNITED
STATES, SECOND AGAINST JAPAN AND THIRD AGAINST CHINA IN THE EAST.
THIS IS OUR GENERAL VIEW OF THE SITUATION. REGARDING TRADE BETWEEN
OUR TWO COUNTRIES, WHEN OUR RELATIONS ARE STILL NOT NORMALIZED, IT
IS IMPOSSIBLE, JUDGING FROM THE GENERAL SITUATION, THAT THERE CAN
BE AN INCREASE IN TRADE. REGARDING THIS GENTLEMAN'S QUESTION
(POINTING AT THE GENTLEMAN) ON CHINA'S ROLE IN THE UNITED NATIONS.
ON THIS, OUR FRIENDS ARE VERY CLEAR. IN GENERAL, WE SUPPORT THE
THIRD WORLD COUNTRIES IN THE UNITED NATIONS. IN THE UNITED NATIONS,
TO PUT IT VERY FRANKLY, WE VERY OFTEN STATE THAT WE SUPPORT THE
THIRD WORLD IN OPPOSING THE TWO SUPERPOWERS. (TANG WEN-SHENG BREAKS
IN TO SAY, &quot;THE TWO HEGEMONISTS) AS TO THE ROLE OF CHINA IN THE
UNITED NATIONS, EVER SINCE THE 26TH UNITED NATIONS GENERAL ASSEMBLY
WHEN CHINA'S LEGITIMATE RIGHTS WERE RESTORED IN THE UNITED NATIONS,
CHINA HAS PLAYED SOME ROLE. BUT IT IS DIFFICULT TO SAY THAT CHINA
PLAYS A BIG ROLE. BUT EVER SINCE WE HAVE ENTERED THE UNITED NATIONS
THE VOICES OF THE THIRD WORLD COUNTRIES HAVE BECOME MORE RESONANT,
INCREASINGLY HEARD. THAT GENTLEMAN (MEANING MOOSE) ASKED ABOUT
OUR MUTUAL INTERESTS AND AREAS OF COOPERATION (TANG WEN-SHENG BREAKS
IN TO CORRECT, &quot;AREAS OF WORKING TOGETHER&quot;). FIRST, I'D LIKE TO
SAY A FEW WORDS ON SINO-US RELATIONS. WHEN YOUR FORMER PRESIDENT
NIXON VISITED CHINA IN 1972, OUR TWO SIDES ISSUED THE SHANGHAI
COMMUNIQUE. PROVIDED THAT BOTH SIDES ADHERE TO THE PRINCIPLES OF
THE SHANGHAI COMMUNIQUE, OUR RELATIONS CAN BE CONTINUOUSLY IMPROVED.
BOTH CHINA AND THE UNITED STATES HAVE MANY COMMON POINTS ON INTER-
NATIONAL ISSUES, BUT WE HAVE DIFFERENT SOCIAL SYSTEMS AND DIFFERENT
IDEOLOGIES. THERE ALSO EXIST DIFFERENCES OF PRINCIPLE BETWEEN
US. LET US BOTH, CHINA AND THE UNITED STATES, EXERT OUR EFFORTS
ON THE BASIS OF THE PRINCIPLES OF THE SHANGHAI COMMUNIQUE. AS FOR
COOPERATION OR ALLIANCE, WE ARE NOT FOR SUCH A THING. FIRST OF
CONFIDENTIAL

PAGE 03        PEKING 01430  02 OF 04  292137Z

ALL, WE HAVE A COMMON VIEWPOINT. BOTH CHINA AND THE US MUST COUNTER-
OUR &quot;ALLY&quot; IN THE NORTH. BUT WE HAVE A KEY ISSUE IN THE QUESTION
OF NORMALIZATION OF RELATIONS. THE ISSUE OF TAIWAN. REGARDING THE
QUESTION OF TAIWAN, OUR POSITION REGARDING TAIWAN IS VERY CLEAR.
I PRESUME THAT OUR FRIENDS PRESENT ARE VERY CLEAR. FIRST OF ALL,
IT IS THE UNITED STATES THAT OWES US A DEBT. IF NORMALIZATION OF
RELATIONS IS TO TAKE PLACE, WE MUST EXPLICITLY STATE OUR STAND.
THAT IS, WE HAVE THREE CONDITIONS. THEY ARE:  ONE, SEVERANCE OF
DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS WITH TAIWAN; TWO, WITHDRAWAL OF TROOPS FROM

WORLD.  THERE IS NO WAY TO CHANGE THIS.  AS FOR CHINA, CHINA
CONSTITUTES NO THREAT TO ANYBODY.  IT DOES NOT ASPIRE TO EXPAN-
SIONISM. THE INSTRUCTIONS BY CHAIRMAN MAO ARE VERY CLEAR. DIG
TUNNELS DEEP, STORE GRAIN EVERYWHERE AND NEVER SEEK HEGEMONY.
WE HAVE NO TROOPS STATIONED ON THE SOIL OF ANY OTHER COUNTRY IN
THE WORLD.  OUR CHINESE PEOPLE'S VOLUNTEERS WERE COMPLETELY WITH-
DRAWN IN 1958 FROM KOREA.  NOW IT IS THE UNITED STATES THAT HAS
NOT WITHDRAWN ITS TROOPS FROM SOUTH KOREA.  THE SOVIET UNION IS
EXPANDING AND SEEKING HEGEMONY.  THIS IS DETERMINED BY THE NATURE
OF ITS SOCIAL IMPERIALISM.  IT IS VERY AMBITIOUS, BUT ITS STRENGTH
IS LIMITED.  IN A SENSE THE SOCIAL IMPERIALISTS ARE VERY WEAK.

MCFADDED:  YOU HAVE SAID THAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO SEE US WITHDRAW
TROOPS FROM KOREA AND BREAK OUR TREATY WITH SOUTH KOREA.  YOU HAVE
SAID THAT YOU WOULD LIKE US TO WITHDRAW TROOPS FROM TAIWAN AND
BREAK OUR TREATY WITH TAIWAN.  WOULD YOU FAVOR US WITHDRAWING
TROOPS FROM JAPAN AND ABROGATING OUR TREATY WITH JAPAN?

WANG:  IN PRINCIPLE, WE ARE AGAINST ESTABLISHMENT OF MILITARY BASES
OR STATIONING OF ANY TROOPS ON FOREIGN SOIL.  THIS IS OUR CONSISTENT
STAND.  REGARDING TAIWAN, I'VE ALREADY SAID THAT THIS IS AN INTERNAL
AFFAIR OF THE CHINESE PEOPLE. IT IS THE UNITED STATES THAT OWES
US A DEBT.  IT WAS MENTIONED VERY EXPLICITLY IN THE SHANGHAI
COMMUNIQUE THAT TAIWAN IS ONE OF CHINA'S PROVINCES.  WITH REGARD
TO JAPAN, OUR RELATIONS WITH IT TODAY ARE NOT SO GOOD AND ARE NOT
SO BAD.  BUT RECENTLY EVERYONE KNOWS THAT JAPAN'S
MIKI (TING YUAN-HUNG CUTS IN TO CORRECT:  FOREIGN
MINISTER MIYAZAWA).. MIYAZAWA HAS MADE A STATEMENT THAT WE REGARD
CONFIDENTIAL

PAGE 02        PEKING 01430  03 OF 03  291659Z

AS REGRETTABLE; THAT IS A SERIOUS VIOLATION OF THE PRINCIPLES OF
THE SINO-JAPANESE JOINT STATEMENT; AND IT CONSTITUTES CRUDE INTER-
FERENCE IN THE INTERNAL AFFAIRS OF CHINA.  THEREFORE, WE COULD NOT
BUT EXPRESS REGRET AT THE STATEMENT.

CZARNECKI:  MADAME VICE FOREIGN MINISTER, SINCE WE BOTH SEEM TO
AGREE ON IDENTIFICATION OF THE PROBLEMS EVEN THOUGH OUR PERSPECTIVES
DIFFER VIEW POINTS ARE CLOSE HERE.  THE SOVIET UNION IS
EXPANDING IN MANY AREAS. IN VIEW OF THIS, HOW DO YOU REGARD THE
PRESENCE OF THE AMERICAN NAVY IN THE INDIAN OCEAN WHEN THE SOVIET
NAVAL MOVEMENTS HAVE BEEN INCREASING IN RECENT YEARS.  IS THE PRE-
SENCE OF THE AMERICAN NAVY A STABILIZING FACTOR OR A DESTABIL-
IZING FACTOR?

WANG:  THE SOVIET UNION'S NAVAL EXPANSION IN THE INDIAN IS
FIRST OF ALL AIMED AND DIRECTED AT THE UNITED STATES.  AS I HAVE
STATED, OUR CONSISTENT STAND IS, WE OPPOSE ANY ESTABLISHMENT OF
MILITARY BASES OR STATIONING OF TROOPS IN ANY FORIGN COUNTRY BY
ANOTHER COUNTRY.

CZARNECKI:  WOULD THIS APPLY TO THE SOVIET UNION?

WANG:  OF COURSE.

(TANG WEN-SHENG CUTS IN TO SAY, &quot;THE INDIAN OCEAN IS NOT A COUNTRY.&quot;)

WANG:  I WILL STATE AGAIN OUR CONSISTENT STAND.  WE ARE AGAINST
ESTABLISHMENT OF MILITARY BASES OR STATIONING OF FOREIGN TROOPS
ABROAD.  THIS IS ALSO APPLICABLE TO THE SOVIET UNION.  AS I HAVE
MENTIONED, THE NAVL EXPANSION OF THE SOVIET UNION IN THE INDIAN
OCEAN IS FIRST AND FOREMOST DIRECTED AT THE UNITED STATES. BUT THE
FOCAL POINT OF THE SOVIET UNION IS STILL EUROPE.

CZARNECKI:  I THINK WE'LL AGREE ON THAT.

WANG:  WE'VE TOLD OUR FRIENDS FROM EUROPE THAT WE HOPE THEY AND
THE UNITED STATES WOULD MAINTAIN A RELATIONSHIP OF EQUALITY AND
PARTNERSHIP.

BRENNER:  MANY AMERICANS ARE CONCERNED ABNIT NUCLEAR PROLIFERATION.
IT IS BOTH DANGEROUS AND COSTLY.  IS CHINA THINKING ABOUT WAYS TO
CONFIDENTIAL

PAGE 03        PEKING 01430  03 OF 03  291659Z

PREVENT THE SPREAD OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS?

WANG:  WE HAVE ALSO DEVELOPED OUR OWN NUCLEAR WEAPONS, BUT THOSE
WE HAVE DEVELOPED ARE VERY LIMITED.  THEY ARE MAINLY FOR THE PURPOSE
OF SMASHING THE NUCLEAR MONOPOLY.  IT IS AIMED AT DESTROYING NUCLEAR
WEAPONS.  THIS HAS BEEN OUR CONSISTENT STAND.

BEST:  MY VIEW OF THE WORLD IS THAT THE UNITED STATES WANTS PEACE,
THAT IT IS TIRED OF PREJUDICES AND SO FORTH. THE UNITED STATES AND
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE AT A CROSSROADS.  SHOULD WE TAKE STEPS TO
PROTECT OUR INTERESTS? WE HOPE THAT WE CAN HAVE MUTUAL ASSISTANCE
AND CAN HAVE CERTAIN UNDERSTANDINGS IN MILITARY AFFAIRS. BUT HOW
DO WE GET THE AMERICAN PEOPLE TO UNDERSTAND THERE IS A NEED FOR A
STRONG DEFENSE?  HOW CAN WE GET THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT TO UNDER-
STAND THAT THERE IS A NEED FOR A STRONG EUROPE?  IF MY QUESTION AND
MY STATEMENT IS A LITTLE UNCLEAR, I APOLOGIZE BECAUSE I'M VERY
TIRED.

WANG: I CAN UNDERSTAND THAT YOU ARE TIRED. YOU DIDN'T SLEEP AT
ALL LAST NIGHT. I HOPE THAT TONIGHT YOU ALL SLEEP WELL. WITH
REGARD TO YOUR UNDERSTAND ON MILITARY COOPERATION AND THE
DILEMMA OF HOW YOU GET THE AMERICAN PEOPLE TO UNDERSTAND THE NEED
FOR A STRONG DEFENSE, THIS IS YOUR AMERICAN AFFAIR.  MAYBE YOU CAN
ASK PRESIDENT FORD HOW TO SOLVE IT.

MCFADDEN: RECENTLY THE CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES HAS TAKEN A
COVENANT TO MAKE THE MARIANAS A PROVINCE OF THE UNITED STATES, ALSO
THE MARSHALL ISLANDS.  THESE ARE TRUSTS AND WE WILL BE DISCUSSING
THEIR STATUS IN THE FUTURE.  THESE ARE STRATEGIC TRUSTS UNDER THE
UNITED NATIONS CHARTER.  IF ACTION BY THE UNITED NATIONS SECURITY
COUNCIL WERE REQUIRED TO DISPOSE OF THE TRUSTS, WHAT POSITION
WOULD THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT TAKE?
(TANG WEN-SHENG REINTERPRETS THE QUESTION AND EXPLAINS IT TO WANG
HAI-JUNG)

WANG:  WE SHALL WAIT AND WE SHALL STUDY THE QUESTION AT THE UNITED
NATIONS BEFORE WE TAKE UP THE ISSUE.

CZARNECKI:  I KNOW THIS HAS BEEN A VERY INTERESTING SESSION, BUT
I FEAR THAT WE HAVE BEEN TAKING UP TOO MUCH OF YOUR TIME.  WE
APPRECIATE YOUR VERY CLEAR EXPOSITION OF THE VIEWS OF THE CHINESE
CONFIDENTIAL

PAGE 04        PEKING 01430  03 OF 03  291659Z

GOVERNMENT ON A GREAT VARIETY OF ISSUES.  YOU HAVE ALSO SAT PAT-
IENTLY AND LISTENED TO OUR VIEWS.  WE ARE VERY GRATEFUL FOR THE
OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE THIS KIND OF EXCHANGE.

WANG:  WE HAVE EXCHANGED VIEWS IN A FRANK MANNER. ON CERTAIN
ISSUES WHAT I'VE SAID IS PERHAPS NOT VERY PLEASANT FOR YOU (NAN TING)
,
BUT THESE ARE OUR HONEST WORDS.  WE THANK YOU FOR COMING TO VISIT
OUR COUNTRY.  THESE FRANK EXCHANGES OF OPINIONS AND VIEWS ARE USEFUL
IN PROMOTING AND DEVELOPING OUR MUTUAL INTERESTS.  WE HOPE THAT IN
THE COURSE OF YOUR TRAVEL TO OTHER PROVINCES OF THE COUNTRY YOU WILL
WITNESS THE SPIRITUAL AND MENTAL OUTLOOK OF THE PEOPLE WHO AFTER
THE GREAT PROLITARIAN CULTURAL REVOLUTION, THE MOVEMENT TO CRITICIZE
LIN PIAO AND CONFUCIUS, THE ANTI-TENG HSIAO-PING MOVEMENT AND
THE COUNTER BLOW AGAINST THE RIGHT DEVIATIONIST WIND TO REVERSE
PREVIOUS VERDICTS HAVE ACHIEVED GREAT VICTORIES. LAST NIGHT ALL
OF YOU DIDN'T SELLP WELL. YOU MUST BE VERY TIRED. I HOPE THAT
THE CHINESE PEOPLE'S INSTITUTE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS HAS ARRANGED
FOR A BETTER REST TONIGHT. WE ALL SHOOK FOR A WHILE, BUT WE ARE
ALL STILL ON THIS EARTH.  SHALL WE REACH AN AGREEMENT NOW THAT
OUR DISCUSSION WAS OFF THE RECORD AND NOT FOR PUBLICATION?

CZARNECKI: YES, THAT'S FINE.

WANG: MR. KE PO-NIEN IS MY ELDER GENERATION. I CALL KHIM REVERED

VICE MINISTER WANG HAI-JUNG: WELCOME. TODAY, BECAUSE OF THE
SUDDEN EARTHQUAKE THAT OCCURRED THIS MORNING, THERE WAS UNEASI-
NESS CAUSED AMONG OUR FRIENDS. ARE YOU AFRAID NOW?
CONFIDENTIAL

PAGE 03        PEKING 01430  01 OF 03  291132Z

CZARNECKI: AT 3:45 THIS MORNING WE WERE.

WANG: BUT NOT NOW?

CZARNECKI: NO.

WANG: THE EPICENTER WAS AT A PLACE 150 KMS. TO THE SOUTHEAST OF
PEKING. IT REGISTERED 7.4 ON THE RICHTER SCALE. ACCORDING TO THE
GENERAL LAW OF EARTHQUAKES, NORMALLY AFTER THE QUAKE THERE
AFTER-SHOCKS, TODAY, TOMORROW AND THE FOLLOWING DAY. BUT THE
DEPARTMENTS CONCERNED RESPONSIBLE FOR RESEARCH AND PREDICTIONS
WILL LET YOU KNOW AS SOON AS WE HAVE ANY INFORMATION. THE HOST
ORGANIZATION WILL LET YOU KNOW WHEN WE TRULY KNOW. THERE IS NO
NEED TO BE AFRAID. WHERE DO EARTHQUAKES TAKE PLACE MOST FREQUENTLY
IN THE UNITED STATES?

WANG: GENERALLY SPEAKING, WHAT IS THE DEGREE ON THE RICHTER SCALE?

CZARNECKI: I HAVE TO DEFER TO MY FRIEND FROM CALIFORNIA, MR.
LIEBERTHAL.

LIEBERTHAL: I REALLY DON'T KNOW, OVER 6.

HOLT: EVERYTHING IS BIGGER IN CHINA.

WANG: NOT NECESSARILY. THERE HAVE ALSO BEEN MINOR TREMORS, SOME
HAVE BEEN 4 PLUS, SOME HAVE BEEN 5 PLUS. THIS TIME THE EPICENTER
WAS CLOSER TO PEKING, ONLY 150 KMS. TO THE SOUTHEAST. WE FELT IT,
THE TRMOR, MORE THIS TIME. WHAT VIEWS DO THE FRIENDS FROM THE
WESTERN HEMISPHERE HAVE?

CZARNECKI: MADAME VICE FOREIGN MINISTER, LET ME FIRST EXPRESS TO
YOU OUR APPRECIATEION FOR LETTING US MEET WITH YOU, ESPECIALLY IN
VIEW OF THIS MORNING'S EVENTS. ON BEHALF OF MY COLLEAGUES, LET
ME EXPRESS OUR SYMPATHIES TO THE CHINESE PEOPLE WHO MAY HAVE BEEN
HURT AND TO OUR CHINESE HOSTS, WHO HAVE SHOWN GREAT COURAGE AND
GREAT CONCERN FOR OUR HEALTH STARTING FROM VERY EARLY THIS MORNING.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

WANG: BUT YOU ARE OUR FRIENDS WHO HAVE COME TO VISIT OUR COUNTRY.
CONFIDENTIAL

PAGE 04        PEKING 01430  01 OF 03  291132Z

THIS IS OUR OBLIGATION.

CZARNECKI: YOU ARE VERY KIND. WE HAVE MANY ISSUES WHICH WE WOULD
LIKE TO DISCUSS WITH YOU. WITH YOUR PERMISSION I WOULD LIKE TO
LEAD OFF WITH A GENERAL QUESTION, THEN ALLOW MY COLLEAGUES TO ASK
THEIR OWN PERSONAL QUESTIONS.

WANG: ALL RIGHT.

CZARNECKI: I THINK ALL OF US ARE OF THE SAME MIND. WE ARE LOOKING
FORWARD TO AND HOPING FOR A CONTINUATION AND AN INCREASE IN GOOD AND
BETTER RELATIONS WITH CHINA. ONE AREA THAT IS VERY VITAL TO BOTH
COUNTRIES IS ASIA, THE PERIPHERY ESPECIALLY OF ASIA. WHAT IS YOUR
GOVERNMENT'S PERCEPTION OF THE PROPER AND CONSTRUCTIVE ROLE FOR THE
UNITED STATES IN TERMS OF POLITICAL, DIPLOMATIC, MILITARY AND
ECONOMIC INTERESTS IN ALL REGIONS STRETCHING FROM THE INDIAN
OCEAN TO JAPAN AND THE PACIFIC REGION? WHAT IS THE VIEW OF THE
CHINESE GOVERNMENT?

WANG: THIS IS VERY DIFFICULT FOR US TO ANSWER. THIS A MATTER
WHICH IS THE AFFAIR OF THE UNITED STATES.

CZARNECKI: YET IN MANY PLACES IN THAT PARTICULAR REGION OUR
INTERESTS CONVERGE AND SOMETIMES THEY SEEM TO BE OPPOSED. BUT
LOOKING AT THE LARGER FRAMEWORK OF CONTINUING INTERESTS, WE WONDER
HOW YOU VIEW OUR MILITARY PRESENCE IN SOUTH KOREA.

WANG: OUR POSITION ON KOREA AND OUR STAND IS CONSISTENT AND YOU
UNDERSTAND IT QUITE WELL. IN SOUTH KOREA, OUR STAND IS THAT WE
FAVOR DISSOLUTION OF THE UNITED NATIONS COMMAND AND THAT YOU WITH-
DRAW ALL TROOPS FROM SOUTH KOREA AND THAT THE KOREAN QUESTION BE
LEFT TO THE KOREAN PEOPLE THEMSELVES TO SOLVE AND WE ALSO SUPPORT
THE STAND OF NORTH KOREA FOR INDEPENDENCE AND PEACEFUL REUNIFICATION
OF KOREA. THIS STAND HAS ALWAYS BEEN CONSISTENT. IT IS CLEAR TO
YOU. WE HAVE EXPLAINED IT TO OTHER AMERICAN FRIENDS WHO HAVE
VISITED. TO YOUR PRESIDENT FORD WHEN HE WAS HERE. TO YOUR SECRETARY
OF STATE, DR. HENRY KISSINGER. THIS STAND IS KNOW TO ALL AND LAST
YEAR DURING THE 30TH UNITED NATIONS GENERAL ASSEMBLY OUR FOREIGN
MINISTER ALSO EXPRESSED IT VERY CLEARLY. HE EXPRESSED THE POSITION
OF THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT ON KOREA.

CONFIDENTIAL

PAGE 05        PEKING 01430  01 OF 03  291132Z

CZARNECKI: IN THE CONTEXT OF WHAT YOU HAVE SAID, I WOULD JUDGE
THAT THAT KIND OF PROPOSAL THAT SECRETARY KISSINGER MADE LAST WEEK
FOR DISCUSSIONS THAT WOULD INVOLVE THE UNITED STATES, NORTH KOREA,
SOUTH KOREA AND CHINA WOULD NOT BE VIEWED AS ACHIEVING THE OBJEC-
TIVES THAT YOU HAVE OUTLINED.
(NOTE: AT THIS POINT TING YUAN-HUNG AND TANG WEN-SHENG SIMULTAN-
EOUSLY CORRECTED THE TRANSLATOR)

WANG: NO. WELL, I'M AWARE OF THE PROPOSAL BY SECRETARY OF STATE
DR. HENRY KISSINGER IN HIS SEATTLE SPEECH LAST WEEK. HIS PROPOSAL
WAS NOT AT ALL A NEW ONE. WHAT KIND OF NEW PROPOSAL IS THIS? OUR
STAND ON KOREA IS CLEAR TO YOU ALL.

HOLT: THANK YOU. I'D LIKE TO REPEAT THE WORDS OF APPRECIATION
FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO MEET WITH YOU AND TO EMPHASIZE OUR GRATITUDE
TO OUR HOSTS IN THE CHINESE PEOPLE'S INSTITUTE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS
WHO THIS MORNING TOOK EVERY STEP TO INSURE OUR COMFORT AND SAFEY.
THERE ARE AGREAT MANY THINGS I'D BE INTERESTED IN DISCUSSING WITH
THE VICE MINISTER OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS, BUT WE HAVE A LARGE GROUP
AND I'VE BEEN TAKING A LOT OF TIME ON THIS TRIP, AND I'D LIKE TO
YIELD TO OTHERS IN THIS GROUP.

WANG: DO THE OTHER FRIENDS HAVE QUESTIONS?

LIEBERTHAL: IN 1973 AT THE TENGTH PARTY CONGRESS, PREMIER CHOU
EN-LAI SAID THAT THE USSR IS FEINTING TO THE EAST, BUT ATTACKING
TO THE WEST; BUT AT THE SAME TIME PREMIER CHOU WARNED AGAINST A
SURPRISE ATTACK. DOES THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT STILL BELIEVE THERE
IS ANY POSSIBILITY OF A SURPRISE ATTACK?

WANG: ARE THERE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS?

STARK: I'D LIKE TO HEAR YOUR VIEWS ON CHINA-JAPAN TRADE RELATIONS
AND ON UNITED STATES-CHINA TRADE RELATIONS, PARTICULARLY THE OUT-
LOOK FOR THEM.

WANG: ANY OTHER QUESTIONS?

SAYLOR: WE HAVE SEEN THE UNITED NATIONS AND OTHER MULTI-NATIONAL
FOR OVER MANY YEARS TIED UP IN DISCUSSION AND DEBATE THAT SEEMED TO
CONFIDENTIAL

WANG: ANY OTHER QUESTIONS?

MOOSE: I'D LIKE TO HEAR FROM THE VICE FOREIGN MINISTER WHETHER
SHE SEES ANY POLICY ARES, EITHER IN THE FAR EAST OR ELSEWHERE
IN THE WORLD, WHERE SHE BELIEVES THAT THE UNITED STATES AND CHINA
HAVE COMMON INTERESTS OR COULD WORK TOGETHER.

WANG: ARE THERE ANYOTHER QUESTIONS? NO? WELL, IN THAT CASE
LET ME DISCUSS THE CONSISTENT STAND O  CHINA ON SOME OF THE ISSUES.
FIRST, I'D LIKE TO DEAL WITH OUR VIEWS ON QUESTIONS OF THE GENERAL
INTERNATIONAL SITUATION. WE HOLD THAT THE OVERALL INTERNATIONAL
SITUATION CAN BE DESCRIBED AS: THERE IS GREAT CHAOS UNDER HEAVEN,
BUT THE SITUATION IS EXCELLENT. AND TODAY THERE ARE VARIOUS
FUNDAMENTAL CONTRADICTIONS WHICH ARE SHARPENING. THERE IS A
GENERAL TREND. NATIONS WANT INDEPENDENCE, COUNTRIES WANT LIBERA-
TION, PEOPLES WANT REVOLUTION. THIS TREND IS IRREVERSIBLE, THIS
TREND IS IRRESISTIBLE. AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE WORLD SITUATION
IS MIRE AND MORE FAVORABLE TO THE PEOPLE OF THE WORLD. IT IS
BECOMING MORE AND MORE UNFAVORABLE TO IMPERIALISM AND TO REVISIONISM.
THE AWAKENING AND THE HEIGHTENED CONSCIOUSNESS OF THE PEOPLE OF
THE DEVELOPING COUNTRIES ARE BEING HEIGHTENED EVERY DAY. ACCORDING
TO OUR CALCULATIONS, GENERALLY SPEAKING, FOLLOWING THE END OF WORLD
WAR II MORE THAN 80 COUNTRIES HAVE GAINED INDEPENDENCE. OUR VIEW
OF THE GENERAL WORLD SITUATION IS OPTIMISTIC. WE HAVE FAITH IN
OUR VIEW OF THE GENERAL WORLD SITUATION. WHEN THE LATE PREMIER
CHOU AT THE FOURTH NATIONAL PEOPLE'S CONGRESS (HERE TANG WEN-SHENG
BREAKS IN AND CORRECTS, SAYING THE TENTH PARTY CONGRESS) GAVE HIS
REPORT STATING THAT THE SOVIET UNION WOULD FEINT TO THE EAST BUT
CONFIDENTIAL

PAGE 02        PEKING 01430  02 OF 04  292137Z

STRIKE TO THE WEST, HE ALSO INDICATED THAT THE FOCAL POINT OF CON-
TENTION IS IN EUROPE. BUT OUR VIEW IS THAT NO MATTER WHAT THE
SOVIET UNION DOES, ITS SPEARHEAD IS DIRECTED AGAINST YOU, THE UNITED
STATES. ALTHOUGH THE SOVIET UNION HAS DEPLOYED (HEREHRANG WEN-SHENG
BREAKS IN, CORRECTING TO SAY &quot;SOMEONE HAS SAID THAT, ALTHOUGH THE
SOVIET UNION HAS DEPLOYED) ONE MILLION TROOPS ALONG THE SINO-
SOVIET BORDER, WE STILL BELIEVE THAT THE SPEARHEAD IS DIRECTED
AGAINST YOU. IN OUR VIEW, THE POLAR BEAR WANTS TO FIX YOU (CHENG NI)
AND BITE YOU (YAO NI). OF COURSE, THEY ARE FIRST AND FOREMOST
DIRECTED AGAINST THE UNITED STATES. BUT THIS DOES NOT EXCLUDE THE
POSSIBILITY THAT AT THE SAME TIME THEY ARE ALSO DIRECTED AGAINST
US. OUR VIEW IS THAT THEY ARE DIRECTED FIRST AGAINST THE UNITED
STATES, SECOND AGAINST JAPAN AND THIRD AGAINST CHINA IN THE EAST.
THIS IS OUR GENERAL VIEW OF THE SITUATION. REGARDING TRADE BETWEEN
OUR TWO COUNTRIES, WHEN OUR RELATIONS ARE STILL NOT NORMALIZED, IT
IS IMPOSSIBLE, JUDGING FROM THE GENERAL SITUATION, THAT THERE CAN
BE AN INCREASE IN TRADE. REGARDING THIS GENTLEMAN'S QUESTION
(POINTING AT THE GENTLEMAN) ON CHINA'S ROLE IN THE UNITED NATIONS.
ON THIS, OUR FRIENDS ARE VERY CLEAR. IN GENERAL, WE SUPPORT THE
THIRD WORLD COUNTRIES IN THE UNITED NATIONS. IN THE UNITED NATIONS,
TO PUT IT VERY FRANKLY, WE VERY OFTEN STATE THAT WE SUPPORT THE
THIRD WORLD IN OPPOSING THE TWO SUPERPOWERS. (TANG WEN-SHENG BREAKS
IN TO SAY, &quot;THE TWO HEGEMONISTS) AS TO THE ROLE OF CHINA IN THE
UNITED NATIONS, EVER SINCE THE 26TH UNITED NATIONS GENERAL ASSEMBLY
WHEN CHINA'S LEGITIMATE RIGHTS WERE RESTORED IN THE UNITED NATIONS,
CHINA HAS PLAYED SOME ROLE. BUT IT IS DIFFICULT TO SAY THAT CHINA
PLAYS A BIG ROLE. BUT EVER SINCE WE HAVE ENTERED THE UNITED NATIONS
THE VOICES OF THE THIRD WORLD COUNTRIES HAVE BECOME MORE RESONANT,
INCREASINGLY HEARD. THAT GENTLEMAN (MEANING MOOSE) ASKED ABOUT
OUR MUTUAL INTERESTS AND AREAS OF COOPERATION (TANG WEN-SHENG BREAKS
IN TO CORRECT, &quot;AREAS OF WORKING TOGETHER&quot;). FIRST, I'D LIKE TO
SAY A FEW WORDS ON SINO-US RELATIONS. WHEN YOUR FORMER PRESIDENT
NIXON VISITED CHINA IN 1972, OUR TWO SIDES ISSUED THE SHANGHAI
COMMUNIQUE. PROVIDED THAT BOTH SIDES ADHERE TO THE PRINCIPLES OF
THE SHANGHAI COMMUNIQUE, OUR RELATIONS CAN BE CONTINUOUSLY IMPROVED.
BOTH CHINA AND THE UNITED STATES HAVE MANY COMMON POINTS ON INTER-
NATIONAL ISSUES, BUT WE HAVE DIFFERENT SOCIAL SYSTEMS AND DIFFERENT
IDEOLOGIES. THERE ALSO EXIST DIFFERENCES OF PRINCIPLE BETWEEN
US. LET US BOTH, CHINA AND THE UNITED STATES, EXERT OUR EFFORTS
ON THE BASIS OF THE PRINCIPLES OF THE SHANGHAI COMMUNIQUE. AS FOR
COOPERATION OR ALLIANCE, WE ARE NOT FOR SUCH A THING. FIRST OF
CONFIDENTIAL

PAGE 03        PEKING 01430  02 OF 04  292137Z

ALL, WE HAVE A COMMON VIEWPOINT. BOTH CHINA AND THE US MUST COUNTER-
OUR &quot;ALLY&quot; IN THE NORTH. BUT WE HAVE A KEY ISSUE IN THE QUESTION
OF NORMALIZATION OF RELATIONS. THE ISSUE OF TAIWAN. REGARDING THE
QUESTION OF TAIWAN, OUR POSITION REGARDING TAIWAN IS VERY CLEAR.
I PRESUME THAT OUR FRIENDS PRESENT ARE VERY CLEAR. FIRST OF ALL,
IT IS THE UNITED STATES THAT OWES US A DEBT. IF NORMALIZATION OF
RELATIONS IS TO TAKE PLACE, WE MUST EXPLICITLY STATE OUR STAND.
THAT IS, WE HAVE THREE CONDITIONS. THEY ARE:  ONE, SEVERANCE OF
DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS WITH TAIWAN; TWO, WITHDRAWAL OF TROOPS FROM

WORLD.  THERE IS NO WAY TO CHANGE THIS.  AS FOR CHINA, CHINA
CONSTITUTES NO THREAT TO ANYBODY.  IT DOES NOT ASPIRE TO EXPAN-
SIONISM. THE INSTRUCTIONS BY CHAIRMAN MAO ARE VERY CLEAR. DIG
TUNNELS DEEP, STORE GRAIN EVERYWHERE AND NEVER SEEK HEGEMONY.
WE HAVE NO TROOPS STATIONED ON THE SOIL OF ANY OTHER COUNTRY IN
THE WORLD.  OUR CHINESE PEOPLE'S VOLUNTEERS WERE COMPLETELY WITH-
DRAWN IN 1958 FROM KOREA.  NOW IT IS THE UNITED STATES THAT HAS
NOT WITHDRAWN ITS TROOPS FROM SOUTH KOREA.  THE SOVIET UNION IS
EXPANDING AND SEEKING HEGEMONY.  THIS IS DETERMINED BY THE NATURE
OF ITS SOCIAL IMPERIALISM.  IT IS VERY AMBITIOUS, BUT ITS STRENGTH
IS LIMITED.  IN A SENSE THE SOCIAL IMPERIALISTS ARE VERY WEAK.

MCFADDED:  YOU HAVE SAID THAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO SEE US WITHDRAW
TROOPS FROM KOREA AND BREAK OUR TREATY WITH SOUTH KOREA.  YOU HAVE
SAID THAT YOU WOULD LIKE US TO WITHDRAW TROOPS FROM TAIWAN AND
BREAK OUR TREATY WITH TAIWAN.  WOULD YOU FAVOR US WITHDRAWING
TROOPS FROM JAPAN AND ABROGATING OUR TREATY WITH JAPAN?

WANG:  IN PRINCIPLE, WE ARE AGAINST ESTABLISHMENT OF MILITARY BASES
OR STATIONING OF ANY TROOPS ON FOREIGN SOIL.  THIS IS OUR CONSISTENT
STAND.  REGARDING TAIWAN, I'VE ALREADY SAID THAT THIS IS AN INTERNAL
AFFAIR OF THE CHINESE PEOPLE. IT IS THE UNITED STATES THAT OWES
US A DEBT.  IT WAS MENTIONED VERY EXPLICITLY IN THE SHANGHAI
COMMUNIQUE THAT TAIWAN IS ONE OF CHINA'S PROVINCES.  WITH REGARD
TO JAPAN, OUR RELATIONS WITH IT TODAY ARE NOT SO GOOD AND ARE NOT
SO BAD.  BUT RECENTLY EVERYONE KNOWS THAT JAPAN'S
MIKI (TING YUAN-HUNG CUTS IN TO CORRECT:  FOREIGN
MINISTER MIYAZAWA).. MIYAZAWA HAS MADE A STATEMENT THAT WE REGARD
CONFIDENTIAL

PAGE 02        PEKING 01430  03 OF 03  291659Z

AS REGRETTABLE; THAT IS A SERIOUS VIOLATION OF THE PRINCIPLES OF
THE SINO-JAPANESE JOINT STATEMENT; AND IT CONSTITUTES CRUDE INTER-
FERENCE IN THE INTERNAL AFFAIRS OF CHINA.  THEREFORE, WE COULD NOT
BUT EXPRESS REGRET AT THE STATEMENT.

CZARNECKI:  MADAME VICE FOREIGN MINISTER, SINCE WE BOTH SEEM TO
AGREE ON IDENTIFICATION OF THE PROBLEMS EVEN THOUGH OUR PERSPECTIVES
DIFFER VIEW POINTS ARE CLOSE HERE.  THE SOVIET UNION IS
EXPANDING IN MANY AREAS. IN VIEW OF THIS, HOW DO YOU REGARD THE
PRESENCE OF THE AMERICAN NAVY IN THE INDIAN OCEAN WHEN THE SOVIET
NAVAL MOVEMENTS HAVE BEEN INCREASING IN RECENT YEARS.  IS THE PRE-
SENCE OF THE AMERICAN NAVY A STABILIZING FACTOR OR A DESTABIL-
IZING FACTOR?

WANG:  THE SOVIET UNION'S NAVAL EXPANSION IN THE INDIAN IS
FIRST OF ALL AIMED AND DIRECTED AT THE UNITED STATES.  AS I HAVE
STATED, OUR CONSISTENT STAND IS, WE OPPOSE ANY ESTABLISHMENT OF
MILITARY BASES OR STATIONING OF TROOPS IN ANY FORIGN COUNTRY BY
ANOTHER COUNTRY.

CZARNECKI:  WOULD THIS APPLY TO THE SOVIET UNION?

WANG:  OF COURSE.

(TANG WEN-SHENG CUTS IN TO SAY, &quot;THE INDIAN OCEAN IS NOT A COUNTRY.&quot;)

WANG:  I WILL STATE AGAIN OUR CONSISTENT STAND.  WE ARE AGAINST
ESTABLISHMENT OF MILITARY BASES OR STATIONING OF FOREIGN TROOPS
ABROAD.  THIS IS ALSO APPLICABLE TO THE SOVIET UNION.  AS I HAVE
MENTIONED, THE NAVL EXPANSION OF THE SOVIET UNION IN THE INDIAN
OCEAN IS FIRST AND FOREMOST DIRECTED AT THE UNITED STATES. BUT THE
FOCAL POINT OF THE SOVIET UNION IS STILL EUROPE.

CZARNECKI:  I THINK WE'LL AGREE ON THAT.

WANG:  WE'VE TOLD OUR FRIENDS FROM EUROPE THAT WE HOPE THEY AND
THE UNITED STATES WOULD MAINTAIN A RELATIONSHIP OF EQUALITY AND
PARTNERSHIP.

BRENNER:  MANY AMERICANS ARE CONCERNED ABNIT NUCLEAR PROLIFERATION.
IT IS BOTH DANGEROUS AND COSTLY.  IS CHINA THINKING ABOUT WAYS TO
CONFIDENTIAL

PAGE 03        PEKING 01430  03 OF 03  291659Z

PREVENT THE SPREAD OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS?

WANG:  WE HAVE ALSO DEVELOPED OUR OWN NUCLEAR WEAPONS, BUT THOSE
WE HAVE DEVELOPED ARE VERY LIMITED.  THEY ARE MAINLY FOR THE PURPOSE
OF SMASHING THE NUCLEAR MONOPOLY.  IT IS AIMED AT DESTROYING NUCLEAR
WEAPONS.  THIS HAS BEEN OUR CONSISTENT STAND.

BEST:  MY VIEW OF THE WORLD IS THAT THE UNITED STATES WANTS PEACE,
THAT IT IS TIRED OF PREJUDICES AND SO FORTH. THE UNITED STATES AND
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE AT A CROSSROADS.  SHOULD WE TAKE STEPS TO
PROTECT OUR INTERESTS? WE HOPE THAT WE CAN HAVE MUTUAL ASSISTANCE
AND CAN HAVE CERTAIN UNDERSTANDINGS IN MILITARY AFFAIRS. BUT HOW
DO WE GET THE AMERICAN PEOPLE TO UNDERSTAND THERE IS A NEED FOR A
STRONG DEFENSE?  HOW CAN WE GET THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT TO UNDER-
STAND THAT THERE IS A NEED FOR A STRONG EUROPE?  IF MY QUESTION AND
MY STATEMENT IS A LITTLE UNCLEAR, I APOLOGIZE BECAUSE I'M VERY
TIRED.

WANG: I CAN UNDERSTAND THAT YOU ARE TIRED. YOU DIDN'T SLEEP AT
ALL LAST NIGHT. I HOPE THAT TONIGHT YOU ALL SLEEP WELL. WITH
REGARD TO YOUR UNDERSTAND ON MILITARY COOPERATION AND THE
DILEMMA OF HOW YOU GET THE AMERICAN PEOPLE TO UNDERSTAND THE NEED
FOR A STRONG DEFENSE, THIS IS YOUR AMERICAN AFFAIR.  MAYBE YOU CAN
ASK PRESIDENT FORD HOW TO SOLVE IT.

MCFADDEN: RECENTLY THE CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES HAS TAKEN A
COVENANT TO MAKE THE MARIANAS A PROVINCE OF THE UNITED STATES, ALSO
THE MARSHALL ISLANDS.  THESE ARE TRUSTS AND WE WILL BE DISCUSSING
THEIR STATUS IN THE FUTURE.  THESE ARE STRATEGIC TRUSTS UNDER THE
UNITED NATIONS CHARTER.  IF ACTION BY THE UNITED NATIONS SECURITY
COUNCIL WERE REQUIRED TO DISPOSE OF THE TRUSTS, WHAT POSITION
WOULD THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT TAKE?
(TANG WEN-SHENG REINTERPRETS THE QUESTION AND EXPLAINS IT TO WANG
HAI-JUNG)

WANG:  WE SHALL WAIT AND WE SHALL STUDY THE QUESTION AT THE UNITED
NATIONS BEFORE WE TAKE UP THE ISSUE.

CZARNECKI:  I KNOW THIS HAS BEEN A VERY INTERESTING SESSION, BUT
I FEAR THAT WE HAVE BEEN TAKING UP TOO MUCH OF YOUR TIME.  WE
APPRECIATE YOUR VERY CLEAR EXPOSITION OF THE VIEWS OF THE CHINESE
CONFIDENTIAL

GOVERNMENT ON A GREAT VARIETY OF ISSUES.  YOU HAVE ALSO SAT PAT-
IENTLY AND LISTENED TO OUR VIEWS.  WE ARE VERY GRATEFUL FOR THE
OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE THIS KIND OF EXCHANGE.

WANG:  WE HAVE EXCHANGED VIEWS IN A FRANK MANNER. ON CERTAIN
ISSUES WHAT I'VE SAID IS PERHAPS NOT VERY PLEASANT FOR YOU (NAN TING)
,
BUT THESE ARE OUR HONEST WORDS.  WE THANK YOU FOR COMING TO VISIT
OUR COUNTRY.  THESE FRANK EXCHANGES OF OPINIONS AND VIEWS ARE USEFUL
IN PROMOTING AND DEVELOPING OUR MUTUAL INTERESTS.  WE HOPE THAT IN
THE COURSE OF YOUR TRAVEL TO OTHER PROVINCES OF THE COUNTRY YOU WILL
WITNESS THE SPIRITUAL AND MENTAL OUTLOOK OF THE PEOPLE WHO AFTER
THE GREAT PROLITARIAN CULTURAL REVOLUTION, THE MOVEMENT TO CRITICIZE
LIN PIAO AND CONFUCIUS, THE ANTI-TENG HSIAO-PING MOVEMENT AND
THE COUNTER BLOW AGAINST THE RIGHT DEVIATIONIST WIND TO REVERSE
PREVIOUS VERDICTS HAVE ACHIEVED GREAT VICTORIES. LAST NIGHT ALL
OF YOU DIDN'T SELLP WELL. YOU MUST BE VERY TIRED. I HOPE THAT
THE CHINESE PEOPLE'S INSTITUTE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS HAS ARRANGED
FOR A BETTER REST TONIGHT. WE ALL SHOOK FOR A WHILE, BUT WE ARE
ALL STILL ON THIS EARTH.  SHALL WE REACH AN AGREEMENT NOW THAT
OUR DISCUSSION WAS OFF THE RECORD AND NOT FOR PUBLICATION?

CZARNECKI: YES, THAT'S FINE.

WANG: MR. KE PO-NIEN IS MY ELDER GENERATION. I CALL KHIM REVERED
