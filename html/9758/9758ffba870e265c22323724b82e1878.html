		<h3>Tor</h3>
		<p><a href="https://www.torproject.org">Tor</a> is an encrypted anonymising network that makes it harder to intercept internet communications, or see where communications are coming from or going to.</p>
		<p>In order to use the WikiLeaks public submission system as detailed above you can download the Tor Browser Bundle, which is a Firefox-like browser available for Windows, Mac OS X and GNU/Linux and pre-configured to connect using the anonymising system Tor.</p>
		<h4>Tails</h4>
		<p>If you are at high risk and you have the capacity to do so, you can also access the submission system through a secure operating system called <a href="https://tails.boum.org">Tails</a>. Tails is an operating system launched from a USB stick or a DVD that aim to leaves no traces when the computer is shut down after use and automatically routes your internet traffic through Tor. Tails will require you to have either a USB stick or a DVD at least 4GB big and a laptop or desktop computer.</p>

		<h3>Tips</h3>
		<p>Our submission system works hard to preserve your anonymity, but we recommend you also take some of your own precautions. Please review these basic guidelines. </p>
		<div>
			<h4>1. Contact us if you have specific problems</h4>
			<p>If you have a very large submission, or a submission with a complex format, or are a high-risk source, please <a href="#submit_help_contact">contact us</a>. In our experience it is always possible to find a custom solution for even the most seemingly difficult situations.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h4>2. What computer to use</h4>
			<p>If the computer you are uploading from could subsequently be audited in an investigation, consider using a computer that is not easily tied to you. Technical users can also use <a href="https://tails.boum.org">Tails</a> to help ensure you do not leave any records of your submission on the computer.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h4>3. Do not talk about your submission to others</h4>
			<p>If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in source protection – it is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This includes other media organisations.</p>
		</div>

	</div>

		<h3>After</h3>

		<div>
			<h4>1. Do not talk about your submission to others</h4>
			<p>If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in source protection – it is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This includes other media organisations.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h4>2. Act normal</h4>
			<p>If you are a high-risk source, avoid saying anything or doing anything after submitting which might promote suspicion. In particular, you should try to stick to your normal routine and behaviour.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h4>3. Remove traces of your submission</h4>
			<p>If you are a high-risk source and the computer you prepared your submission on, or uploaded it from, could subsequently be audited in an investigation, we recommend that you format and dispose of the computer hard drive and any other storage media you used.</p>
			<p>In particular, hard drives retain data after formatting which may be visible to a digital forensics team and flash media (USB sticks, memory cards and SSD drives) retain data even after a secure erasure. If you used flash media to store sensitive data, it is important to destroy the media.</p>
			<p>If you do this and are a high-risk source you should make sure there are no traces of the clean-up, since such traces themselves may draw suspicion.</p>
			<div>
				<h4>4. If you face legal action</h4>
				<p>If a legal action is brought against you as a result of your submission, there are organisations that may help you. The Courage Foundation is an international organisation dedicated to the protection of journalistic sources. You can find more details at <a href="https://www.couragefound.org">https://www.couragefound.org</a>.</p>

		<p>WikiLeaks publishes documents of political or historical importance that are censored or otherwise suppressed. We specialise in strategic global publishing and large archives.</p>
		<p>The following is the address of our secure site where you can anonymously upload your documents to WikiLeaks editors. You can only access this submissions system through Tor. (See our <a href="#submit_help_tor">Tor tab</a> for more information.) We also advise you to read our <a href="#submit_help_tips">tips for sources</a> before submitting.</p>

			<!--<div>
				Copy this address into your Tor browser. Advanced users, if they wish, can also add a further layer of encryption to their submission using <a href="#submit_wlkey">our public PGP key</a>.
			</div>-->
		</div>

		<p>If you cannot use Tor, or your submission is very large, or you have specific requirements, WikiLeaks provides several alternative methods. <a href="#submit_help_contact">Contact us</a> to discuss how to proceed.</p>

PAGE 02  STATE  081079

OFFICIAL SUGGESTED JACKSON REFERRED TO SERIES OF LETTERS
FROM NIXON THAT PRIVATELY ASSURED THIEU      US WOULD
DEAL FIRMLY WITH C-F VIOLATIONS AND      US SUPPORT
WOULD CONTINUE (AP, PHINQ).  JACKSON BELIEVES      PRES
MAY HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF AGREEMENTS ONLY RECENTLY.
STATEMENTS BY PRES, HAK AND OTHER ADMIN OFFICIALS CHARGING
CONGRESS WITH BREACH OF FAITH IN MIL AID CUTS TO SVN
HAVE TRIGGERED SUSPICIONS      SECRET UNDERSTANDING HAD
BEEN MADE (CHITRIB).  DOS SPOKESMAN REFERRED NEWSMEN TO
COMMENT BY SECSTATE THAT US HAD NO &quot;LEGAL COMMITMENT&quot; TO
SUPPORT GVN, BUT RATHER   &quot;MORAL COMMITMENT.&quot;  WH AND
DOS EXPECTED ISSUE STATEMENTS ON SUBJECT (FINNEY, NYT).
JACKSON CHARGED HAK AND NIXON ENTERED INTO SECRET AGREEMENTS
WITH SVN, WAS TOLD (BUT WOULD NOT SAY WHO TOLD HIM)
SECSTATE AND PRES GAVE THIEU VERBAL ASSURANCES      US
WOULD BE PREPARED USE MIL POWER IF NVN COMMITTED LARGE-

SCALE C-F VIOLATIONS.  JACKSON CHARGE CAUGHT WH BY
SURPRISE, AND NESSEN DECLINED IMMEDIATE COMMENT, BUT
SAID WOULD RESPOND LATER (WIEGHART/CARTER, NYDN).

SUN'S MILLS NOTES BOTH WH AND HAK PASSED UP CHANCES
COMMENT DIRECTLY ON JACKSON'S CHARGE THAT WAS MADE IN
FLOOR SPEECH.  BELIEVES REMARKS CONSTITUTED NOT ONLY
REBUTTAL TO ADMIN SUGGESTIONS      CONGRESS TO BLAME FOR
SVN MIL LOSSES, BUT ALSO   BROADSIDE ATTACK ON HAK
DIPLOMACY IN GENERAL.  WP'S MARDER QUOTES JACKSON THAT
IF NECESSARY HE WILL CALL HEARINGS AND QUESTION ADMIN
OFFICIALS UNDER OATH.  OPINES CHARGE COULD LEAD TO
HIGHLY CONTENTIOUS DEBATE.  NOTES CHARGE BROUGHT EXPRESSIONS
OF SURPRISE FROM MANSFIELD.  MARDER SEES 2 DIFFERENT
KINDS OF ISSUES INVOLVED IN DISPUTE: ONE TURNS ON WHAT
ASSURANCES US GAVE SVN ABOUT SUPPLIES, PLUS OTHER EXPECTA-
TIONS RAISED TO INDUCE GVN    SIGN C-F; OTHER
CONCERNS WHAT US TOLD SVN IT WOULD DO IN EVENT C-F
MASSIVELY BREACHED.

GEN WEYAND TOLD SASC CLOSED MEETING TUESDAY THAT SVN
CANNOT SURVIVE WITHOUT ADDITIONAL US MIL AID (CSM); SAID

TOLD REPORTERS HE HAD RECOMMENDED AT LEAST 550 MILLION
DOLS IN IMMEDIATE ADDITIONAL GVN MIL AID.  DOS' HABIB
TOLD SFRC THERE IS CHANCE SVN COULD SURVIVE IF MORE MIL
AID RECEIVED; SEVERAL SENATORS &quot;EXTREMELY SKEPTICAL,&quot;
INCLUDING HUMPHREY, WHO DEPLORED LOSS OF ESTIMATED
BILLION IN US-SUPPLIED EQUIPMENT (PHINQ).

NYT'S FINNEY NOTES WEYAND &quot;SOMEWHAT LESS EMPHATIC&quot; ON
WHETHER GVN COULD SURVIVE IF GIVEN MORE MIL AID, BUT
OPINED THERE WAS CHANCE.  ONE OF WEYAND REPORT KEY
RECOMMENDATIONS IS THAT US HELP BOLSTER FORCES AROUND
SAIGON BY ARMING, UPGRADING RFS.  REPORTS HABIB EM-
PHASIZED TO SFR POTENTIAL OF ENLISTING RFS FOR DEFENSE OF
SAIGON, DELTA.  ANOTHER WEYAND RECOMMENDATION IS TO RE-WSRX
EQUIP, REORGANIZE ESTIMATED 15,000 MEN WHO MADE WAY BACK TO
GVN AREAS.  FINNEY OPINES WEYAND'S VIEWS AND RECOMMENDA-
TIONS  ASSUMING CONSIDERABLE IMPORTANCE IN DETERMINING
ADMIN'S DECISION ON WHETHER PRESS RELUCTANT CONGRESS FOR
ADDITIONAL MIL AID.

SUN'S PEPPER NOTES SENS STENNIS, TOWER LEFT SFRC MEETING
SAYING WOULD FAVOR MORE MIL AID, BUT FOES REMAINED SET
AGAINST IT.       HUMPHREY, KENNEDY SEEK SHIFT EMPHASIS
TO HUMANITARIAN AID TO REFUGEES REGARDLESS    WHETHER

IN COMMUNIST AREAS.  WP'S WILSON REPORTS STENNIS ARGUED
MORE MIL AID MIGHT HELP GVN NEGOTIATE MORE FAVORABLE
PEACE WITH NVN.

LAT'S AVERILL (4/8) BELIEVES EASTER RECESS HARDENED
CONGRESS' STAND ON INDOCHINA MIL AID, BUT MADE MORE
RECEPTIVE HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE.  WSTAR'S ANGLE (4/8)
SAYS RETURNING CONGRESS BRINGS PRES  MESSAGE FROM
VOTERS: FORGET ABOUT FURTHER MIL AID TO CAMBODIA AND
SVN.  NOTES FOCUS SHIFTING TO HUMANITARIAN AID FOR
ORPHANS, REFUGEES; OPINES EVEN PRES' STAUNCHEST
SUPPORTERS SEE LITTLE LIKELIHOOD CONGRESS WILL GIVE SEA
ADDITIONAL MIL ASSISTANCE, AND MANY THINK FUTILE IN
ANY EVENT.  PHINQ'S MC CARTNEY REPORTS NEW VIET ISSUE
IS REFUGEE PROBLEM, AND INCLUDES BASIC POLITICAL ISSUE
OF THOSE IN COMMUNIST AREAS.  SEES BROAD DEBATE
UNCLASSIFIED

PAGE 04  STATE  081079

DEVELOPING IN CONGRESS OVER HUMANITARIAN AID TO MILLIONS
OF WAR VICTIMS.  CSM NOTES SENATORS PRESS ADMIN TO STEP
UP REFUGEE AID, WHETHER IN SOUTH OR NORTH.  KENNEDY
URGES APPROACHES DIRECTLY OR THROUGH UN TO VC;
HUMPHREY ADVOCATES LEGISLATION WAIVING BAN BARRING

HEAD FOR NOT PROVIDING UN FUNDS TO HELP REFUGEES IN
COMMUNIST AREAS OF SVN; NOTES EA DEPASSTSEC MILLER
TOLD KENNEDY SUBCOMMITTEE US POSITION ON AID IN
ENEMY-CONTROLLED AREAS IS AMONG COMPLEX OF PROBLEMS

MOST PAPERS STILL FEATURE PHOTOS AND ARTICLES, IN-
CLUDING HUMAN-INTEREST STORIES, ABOUT &quot;OPERATION
BABYLIFT&quot; THOUGH NUMBER ARRIVING SLOWING DOWN.  SOME
NOTE  POSSIBLE START OF ORPHAN FLOW FROM CAMBODIA.
CHITRIB REPORTS PETITIONS URGING PRES EASE VIET
ENTRANCE TO BE PRESENTED FORD AND CONGRESSIONAL LEADERS
THIS WEEK BY NEWLY-FORMED CHICAGO ORGANIZATION.  SOUR
NOTE CREEPS IN AS SEVERAL PAPERS NOTE RUSH TO ADOPT
VIET ORPHANS BYPASSES THOUSANDS OF NEEDY US ORPHANS.
NVN CHARGES EMIGRATION OF SVN ADULTS AND CHILDREN
TO US CONSTITUTES KIDNAPPING (AFP, NYT).  EAST GERMANY
ALSO BRANDS &quot;BABYLIFTING&quot; AS KIDNAPPING AND MEANS OF
ANTI-COMMUNIST AGITATION (WP).

AFL-CIO'S MEANY AT TUESDAY LUNCHEON ADDRESS SAID
CONGRESS OUGHT APPROVE PRES' REQUEST FOR MORE GVN ARMS
AID, AND IF USG CANNOT SHORE UP SVN, SHOULD SEND SHIPS
TO TAKE OUT FRIENDS -- &quot;MAYBE 75,000&quot; -- WHO WOULD BE
KILLED.  ADDED BOTH SVN, NVN GOT MESSAGE WHEN CONGRESS
DIDN'T VOTE EXTRA ARMS AID.  STRONGLY CRITICIZED
HAK AS EXPERT IN &quot;DIPLOMATIC HYPOCRISY&quot; (CAHILL, NYDN).
MEANY STATED HE'S BEHIND FORD VN POLICY (SPERLING, CSM).
SAID CONGRESS, SPECIFICALLY MANSFIELD, MUST BEAR PART
OF BLAME FOR ARVN COLLAPSE (NEWKIRK, CHITRIB).  LAT'S
SHOGAN (WP) NOTES MEANY WADED INTO GROWING PUBLIC
DEBATE OVER FOREIGN AFFAIRS, STATED US POLICY REVERSES

OFFICIAL SUGGESTED JACKSON REFERRED TO SERIES OF LETTERS
FROM NIXON THAT PRIVATELY ASSURED THIEU      US WOULD
DEAL FIRMLY WITH C-F VIOLATIONS AND      US SUPPORT
WOULD CONTINUE (AP, PHINQ).  JACKSON BELIEVES      PRES
MAY HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF AGREEMENTS ONLY RECENTLY.
STATEMENTS BY PRES, HAK AND OTHER ADMIN OFFICIALS CHARGING
CONGRESS WITH BREACH OF FAITH IN MIL AID CUTS TO SVN
HAVE TRIGGERED SUSPICIONS      SECRET UNDERSTANDING HAD
BEEN MADE (CHITRIB).  DOS SPOKESMAN REFERRED NEWSMEN TO
COMMENT BY SECSTATE THAT US HAD NO &quot;LEGAL COMMITMENT&quot; TO
SUPPORT GVN, BUT RATHER   &quot;MORAL COMMITMENT.&quot;  WH AND
DOS EXPECTED ISSUE STATEMENTS ON SUBJECT (FINNEY, NYT).
JACKSON CHARGED HAK AND NIXON ENTERED INTO SECRET AGREEMENTS
WITH SVN, WAS TOLD (BUT WOULD NOT SAY WHO TOLD HIM)
SECSTATE AND PRES GAVE THIEU VERBAL ASSURANCES      US
WOULD BE PREPARED USE MIL POWER IF NVN COMMITTED LARGE-

SCALE C-F VIOLATIONS.  JACKSON CHARGE CAUGHT WH BY
SURPRISE, AND NESSEN DECLINED IMMEDIATE COMMENT, BUT

OFFICIALS UNDER OATH.  OPINES CHARGE COULD LEAD TO
HIGHLY CONTENTIOUS DEBATE.  NOTES CHARGE BROUGHT EXPRESSIONS
OF SURPRISE FROM MANSFIELD.  MARDER SEES 2 DIFFERENT
KINDS OF ISSUES INVOLVED IN DISPUTE: ONE TURNS ON WHAT

TIONS RAISED TO INDUCE GVN    SIGN C-F; OTHER

BILLION IN US-SUPPLIED EQUIPMENT (PHINQ).

NYT'S FINNEY NOTES WEYAND &quot;SOMEWHAT LESS EMPHATIC&quot; ON
