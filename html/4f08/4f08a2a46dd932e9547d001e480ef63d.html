		<h3>Tor</h3>
		<p><a href="https://www.torproject.org">Tor</a> is an encrypted anonymising network that makes it harder to intercept internet communications, or see where communications are coming from or going to.</p>
		<p>In order to use the WikiLeaks public submission system as detailed above you can download the Tor Browser Bundle, which is a Firefox-like browser available for Windows, Mac OS X and GNU/Linux and pre-configured to connect using the anonymising system Tor.</p>
		<h4>Tails</h4>
		<p>If you are at high risk and you have the capacity to do so, you can also access the submission system through a secure operating system called <a href="https://tails.boum.org">Tails</a>. Tails is an operating system launched from a USB stick or a DVD that aim to leaves no traces when the computer is shut down after use and automatically routes your internet traffic through Tor. Tails will require you to have either a USB stick or a DVD at least 4GB big and a laptop or desktop computer.</p>

		<h3>Tips</h3>
		<p>Our submission system works hard to preserve your anonymity, but we recommend you also take some of your own precautions. Please review these basic guidelines. </p>
		<div>
			<h4>1. Contact us if you have specific problems</h4>
			<p>If you have a very large submission, or a submission with a complex format, or are a high-risk source, please <a href="#submit_help_contact">contact us</a>. In our experience it is always possible to find a custom solution for even the most seemingly difficult situations.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h4>2. What computer to use</h4>
			<p>If the computer you are uploading from could subsequently be audited in an investigation, consider using a computer that is not easily tied to you. Technical users can also use <a href="https://tails.boum.org">Tails</a> to help ensure you do not leave any records of your submission on the computer.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h4>3. Do not talk about your submission to others</h4>
			<p>If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in source protection – it is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This includes other media organisations.</p>
		</div>

	</div>

		<h3>After</h3>

		<div>
			<h4>1. Do not talk about your submission to others</h4>
			<p>If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in source protection – it is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This includes other media organisations.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h4>2. Act normal</h4>
			<p>If you are a high-risk source, avoid saying anything or doing anything after submitting which might promote suspicion. In particular, you should try to stick to your normal routine and behaviour.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h4>3. Remove traces of your submission</h4>
			<p>If you are a high-risk source and the computer you prepared your submission on, or uploaded it from, could subsequently be audited in an investigation, we recommend that you format and dispose of the computer hard drive and any other storage media you used.</p>
			<p>In particular, hard drives retain data after formatting which may be visible to a digital forensics team and flash media (USB sticks, memory cards and SSD drives) retain data even after a secure erasure. If you used flash media to store sensitive data, it is important to destroy the media.</p>
			<p>If you do this and are a high-risk source you should make sure there are no traces of the clean-up, since such traces themselves may draw suspicion.</p>
			<div>
				<h4>4. If you face legal action</h4>
				<p>If a legal action is brought against you as a result of your submission, there are organisations that may help you. The Courage Foundation is an international organisation dedicated to the protection of journalistic sources. You can find more details at <a href="https://www.couragefound.org">https://www.couragefound.org</a>.</p>

		<p>WikiLeaks publishes documents of political or historical importance that are censored or otherwise suppressed. We specialise in strategic global publishing and large archives.</p>
		<p>The following is the address of our secure site where you can anonymously upload your documents to WikiLeaks editors. You can only access this submissions system through Tor. (See our <a href="#submit_help_tor">Tor tab</a> for more information.) We also advise you to read our <a href="#submit_help_tips">tips for sources</a> before submitting.</p>

			<!--<div>
				Copy this address into your Tor browser. Advanced users, if they wish, can also add a further layer of encryption to their submission using <a href="#submit_wlkey">our public PGP key</a>.
			</div>-->
		</div>

		<p>If you cannot use Tor, or your submission is very large, or you have specific requirements, WikiLeaks provides several alternative methods. <a href="#submit_help_contact">Contact us</a> to discuss how to proceed.</p>

1. SUMMARY. DURING THE PAST SIX MONTHS, DENG XIAOPING'S
POLITICAL POSITION SEEMED TO STRENGTHEN ALMOST DAILY, WITH
SUBSTANTIAL HELP FROM MAJOR FOREIGN POLICY SUCCESSES.
MOBILIZING RESENTMENT AGAINST PAST DOGMATIC EXCESSES AND
ENCOURAGING RISING DEMANDS FOR RAPID MODERNIZATION, DENG
BEGAN TO BUILD VESTED INTERESTS IN HIS PROGRAM AMONG
GOVERNMENT BUREAUCRATS, STUDENTS INDUSTRIAL WORKERS.
HE SEEMED TO PROMISE ALSO THAT RAPID INDUSTRIALIZATION
WOULD ENSURE PEASANT AND MILITARY INTERESTS DID NOT SUFFER.
THROUGH GAINS MADE AT LATE 1978 PARTY SESSIONS, DENG HAS
BEGUN THE CRITICAL TASK OF REFORMING THE PARTY TO ENSURE
ITS DEPENDABILITY IN LEADING THE DRIVE. HE IS BRINGING
BACK EXPERIENCED PARTY ORGANIZERS, WELCOMING NONPARTY

INTELLECTUALS AND TECHNICIANS AS NEW MEMBERS AND DEMOTING
DISGRUNTLED IDEOLOGUES, INCLUDING THOSE AT A HIGH LEVEL.
2. UNTIL FEBRUARY 17, DENG SEEMED TO HAVE THE MOMENTUM
IN HIS FAVOR BUT NEEDED CONTINUING SUCCESSES AS CHINA'S
LEADERSHIP ENTERED A PERIOD OF TENSE HIGH-LEVEL MANEUVERING
PRIOR TO AN NPC SESSION (PRECEDED BY ANOTHER PARTY PLENUM)
SCHEDULED FOR 1979; DENG MAY ALSO PLAN ANOTHER PARTY
CONGRESS THIS YEAR.
3. CHINA'S INVASION OF VIETNAM, HOWEVER, THREATENS TO
DETOUR DENG'S DRIVE TO POWER AS WELL AS HIS MODERNIZATION
PROGRAM. IT FOCUSES ATTENTION ON HIS ONE MAJOR FAILURE
AND CREATES A FLUIDITY IN THE POLITICAL ARENA WHICH MAY
NOT WORK TO HIS BENEFIT. IN ALL, THE CHANCES OF A MAJOR
LEADERSHIP SPLIT HAVE INCREASED.
4. DENG'S PROGRAM. DENG XIAOPING HAS JUSTIFIED HIS
BREATHTAKINGLY UNORTHODOX APPROACH TO BOTH DOMESTIC AND
FOREIGN POLICY BY STRESSING THE OVERWHELMING ENORMITY OF
THE THREAT OF SOVIET ENCIRCLEMENT. SOVIET-BACKED VIETNAMESE EXPANSION, AND TRENDS POTENTIALLY FAVORABLE TO THE

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
USSR IN SOUTH ASIA, AFRICA AND THE MIDDLE EAST, HAVE
STRENGTHENED THIS ARGUMENT. ESPECIALLY AT THE TURN OF THE
YEAR, MEDIA ITEMS STRESSED THAT BECAUSE OF THIS THREAT,
CHINA HAD NO TIME TO LOSE IN DOING EVERYTHING POSSIBLE -IMPLICITLY REGARDLESS OF IDEOLOGICAL CONSIDERATIONS -- TO
PROMOTE RAPID DEVELOPMENT OF ITS ECONOMIC AND MILITARY
STRENGTH, AND TO ENSURE ITS SECURITY DURING THE NEXT
TWENTY YEARS OF CONTINUING RELATIVE WEAKNESS.
5. THE ANTI-SOVIET THEME CAN EE DETECTED IN
PEKING'S CONCILIATORY APPROACH TO TAIPEI -- SO CRITICAL
TO NORMALIZATION OF U.S.-CHINA RELATIONS --WHICH STRESSES
THAT NATIONAL PATRIOTISM PROVIDES A GOOD BASIS FOR PRCCONFIDENTIAL

TAIWAN RECONCILIATION. DENG'S WILLINGNESS TO ALLOW
TAIWAN TO RETAIN ITS ARMED FORCES UNDERCUTS &quot;ON RECORD&quot;
OPPOSITION TO US ARMS SALES TO TAIWAN, AND IN CONTEXT
ALMOST SUGGESTS TAIWAN, ALONG WITH THE US AND JAPAN, CAN
BE PART OF THE ANTI-SOVIET FRONT.
6. SEVERAL ASPECTS OF DENG XIAOPING'S DOMESTIC PROGRAM -AIMED PRIMARILY AT INCREASING PRODUCTIVITY -- FIT WELL
WITH THIS MESSAGE TO TAIWAN:
-- DENG HAS MOVED RAPIDLY TO GUT THE CONCEPT OF &quot;CLASS
STRUGGLE&quot; BETWEEN THE &quot;PEOPLE&quot; AND THE &quot;ENEMY&quot; BY
GIVING AMNESTY TO FORMER LANDLORDS, INDUSTRIALISTS,
AND RIGHTISTS, REDEFINING THEM AND OTHER PREVIOUSLY
SUSPECT GROUPS SUCH AS INTELLECTUALS, RETURNED OVERSEAS CHINESE, AND RELIGIOUS ETHNIC MINORITIES (AND
IMPLICITLY THE &quot;BOURGEOISIE&quot; ON TAIWAN) AS &quot;PEOPLE&quot;
ON THE BASIS OF PATRIOTIC WILLINGNESS TO WORK FOR
ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT;
-- RECENT REFERENCES IN THE MEDIA AND THE COMMUNIQUE OF
THE DECEMBER PARTY PLENUM TO &quot;PEOPLE'S DEMOCRACY&quot;
RATHER THAN &quot;SOCIALIST DEMOCRACY&quot; HARK BACK TO THE
EARLY 1950'S WHEN, IN DEFIANCE OF SOVIET DOCTRINE,
MAO HELD THAT CHINA COULD EVOLVE GRADUALLY AND PEACEFULLY TOWARD SOCIALISM, NOT UNDER A &quot;DICTATORSHIP OF
THE PROLETARIAT&quot; (A COALITION OF THE PROLETARIAT, THE
PEASANTRY, AND THE BOURGEOISIE -- WHICH COULD INCLUDE
KMT PATRIOTS);
-- THE NEW LIBERALIZATION IN CULTURAL AND INTELLECTUAL
MATTERS AND GREATER VENTILATION OF DISSENTING VIEWS
ALSO SERVES TO CONVINCE THE WORLD (INCLUDING TAIWAN)

THERE IS SAFETY IN COOPERATION WITH A &quot;NEW&quot; CHINA.
7. THESE TRENDS -- WHICH EFFECTIVELY CITE MAO'S EARLY
WORKS TO REPUDIATE THE POLICIES OF THE LAST TWENTRS-MAY WELL BE STRENGTHENED BY REWRITES OF BOTH THE PARTY AND
STATE CONSTITUTIONS AT MAJOR PARTY AND GOVERNMENT SESSIONS
IN TIME FOR THE CELEBRATION OF THE THIRTIETH ANNIVERSARY
OF THE PRC ON OCTOBER 1.
8. LARGE ELEMENTS OF DENG XIAOPING'S PROGRAM COULD ENGENDER SERIOUS OPPOSITION, HOWEVER, ALONG THE LINES OF THE
READY-MADE MAOIST CRITIQUE, IF, FOR EXAMPLE:
-- DENG'S APPROACH TO DEVELOPMENT, BASED ON MASSIVE
FOREIGN IMPORTS, WERE SERIOUSLY IMPAIRED BY SOME COMBINATION OF BAD WEATHER, AN UNFAVORABLE INTERNATIONAL
ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT, LACK OF OIL RESERVES, OR AN
INABILITY OF CHINA'S EXPERTISE-POOR, BUREAUCRACYRIDDEN SYSTEM TO ABSORB AND TRANSFORM FOREIGN TECHNOLOGY AND CAPITAL;
-- IN THE NEAR FUTURE, THERE WERE SIGNIFICANT SETBACKS IN
THE EVOLUTION OF THE NEW US-CHINA RELATIONSHIP.
9. DEBATING VIETNAM POLICY. THE MOST OBVIOUS AND
IMMEDIATE FLAW IN DENG'S PROGRAM IS THE DANGER OF WAR
INHERENT IN ITS LOGIC. BEFORE MID-JANUARY, THE CHINESE
LEADERSHIP HOPED TO AVOID MILITARY CONFRONTATION WITH
VIETNAM IN RECOGNITION OF PLA WEAKNESS, IN DEFERENCE TO
MODERNIZATION, AND IN ORDER TO USE DIPLOMACY TO BRING
INTERNATIONAL &quot;UNITED FRONT&quot; PRESSURE TO BEAR ON THE USSR
AND VIETNAM. BUT THROUGHOUT 1978, THERE WERE SIGNS OF
INDECISION REGARDING THE ASSESSMENT OF THE INTERNATIONAL
SITUATION AND THE THREAT TO CHINA (AND PROBABLY, THEREFORE, HOW TO HANDLE IT). THIS BECAME ESPECIALLY EVIDENT
AT THE TURN OF THE YEAR WHEN:

-- THE LATE DECEMBER PARTY PLENUM COMMUNIQUE MADE AN
UNUSUAL REFERENCE TO THE NEED TO STRENGTHEN NATIONAL
DEFENSE IN ORDER TO REPULSE &quot;AT ANY MOMENT&quot; AGGRESSORS
FROM &quot;ANY DIRECTION,&quot; IMPLYING CHINA IS FACED WITH A
SERIOUS THREAT IN THE SOUTH, BUT

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
-- THE ANNUAL NEW YEAR EDITORIAL MADE AN UNPRECEDENTED
OMISSION OF DISCUSSION OF THE INTERNATIONAL SITUATION
AND THE SOVIET THREAT TO CHINA; AN
-- DENG ON JANUARY 1 SEEMED LESS CONCERNED ABOUT AN
IMMINENT THREAT, SPOKE OF VIETNAMESE &quot;SMALL HEGEMONISM&quot;
AS MERELY &quot;MAKING TROUBLE,&quot; MADE NO REFERENCE TO MILITARY PREPAREDNESS, AND POINTEDLY DECLARED THAT THE
THREAT TO PEACE AND POSSIBLITY OF AGRESSION CAME ONLY
&quot;FROM THE NORTH.&quot;
10. DENG MAY HAVE BEEN URGING MILITARY RESTRAINT TOWARD
VIETNAM, STRESSING DIPLOMATIC EFFORTS TO AVOID PROVOKING
A SOVIET REACTION OR ALARMING CHINA'S NEW FRIENDS. THIS
HYPOTHESIS IS SUPPORTED BY DENG.S EARLY JANUARY COMMENTS
TO VISITORS WHICH IMPLICITLY REJECTED AN IMMEDIATE
CHINESE INTERVENTION.
11. THERE IS LITTLE INFORMATION ABOUT THE ARGUMENTS PUT
FORTH WHICH LED TO THE CONSENSUS TO INITIATE A QUICK
STRIKE &quot;LIMITED IN TIME AND SPACE.&quot; THE CONSENSUS WAS NO
DOUBT CEMENTED BY EMOTIONAL REACTION TO PERCEIVED VIETNAMESE INGRATITUDE AND PERFIDY. IT IS LIKELY THAT DENG
XIAOPING'S CHOICES WERE SHAPED BY STRONG ARGUMENTS FROM
KEY CENTRAL AND REGIONAL MILITARY FIGURES IN FAVOR OF
INTERVENTION IN RESPONSE TO INSULTING SOVIET-VIETNAMESE

PROVOCATIONS IN ORDER TO DEFEND THE REPUTATION OF THE PRC
AND THE PLA, AND TO FOREWARN THE USSR AND VIETNAM THAT
CHINA WILL DEFEND ITS INTERESTS WITH FORCE. MAOISTS,
INCLUDING VICE CHAIRMAN WAN DONGXING AND PERHAPS ALSO
CHAIRMAN HUA, PROBABLY HAD LITTLE INFLUENCE ON THE DECISION BUT MAY HAVE AGREED TO INTERVENTION IN THE HOPE OF
RELIEVING PRESSURE ON THE KAMPUCHEAN RESISTANCE MOVEMENT
LED BY POL POT (FOR WHOM THEY HAVE SHOWN SPECIAL CONCERN);
THEY HAVE LITTLE TO LOSE AND MUCH TO GAIN POLITICALLY IF
DENG'S POLICIES SUFFER A SETBACK AS A RESULT. FOREIGN
AFFAIRS SPECIALISTS AND CLOSE ASSOCIATES OF THE LATE
PREMIER CHOU ENLAI -- LIKE VICE CHAIRMAN YE JIANYING AND
LI XIANNIAN AND THE NEWLY-APPOINTED SECRETARY-GENERAL
OF THE MILITARY COMMISSION -- PROBABLY HELD OUT LONGEST,
FEARING DAMAGE TO CHINA'S ECONOMY APLOMACY.
12. DENG'S 1978 HARD LINE TOWARD VIETNAM AS THE &quot;CUBA OF
ASIA&quot; WAS FOLLOWED BY A MILITARY BUILDUP ALONG THE BORDER,
PROBABLY AGREED TO BY CIVILIAN LEADERS ON THE GROUNDS THAT
A CREDIBLE THREAT OF FORCE WOULD BUTTRESS DIPLOMATIC
EFFORTS TO PERSUADE VIETNAM TO MEND ITS WAYS. DENG THUS
COULD BUILD POLITICAL SUPPORT WITHIN BOTH GROUPS FOR HIS
GENERAL PROGRAM, INCLUDING STRENGTHENED TIES WITH THE

WEST.
13. BUT DENG'S POLICY WAS FOUND WANTING WHEN HANOI JOINED
CEMA, SIGNED A TREATY WITH THE USSR, TOOK THE OPPORTUNITY
OF THE US-CHINA NORMALIZATION PROCESS TO INVADE KAMPUCHEA,
ON THE ASSUMPTION CHINA'S REACTION WOULD BE RESTRAINED.
AT THAT POINT, DENG'S ATTACKS ON &quot;APPEASEMENT&quot; ELSEWHERE
MADE CHINESE INACTION LOOK HYPOCRITICAL AND SOLE RELIANCE
ON DIPLOMACY APPEAR INEFFECTUAL. THE MILITARY COULD ARGUE
PERSUASIVELY THAT CHINA MUST &quot;PUT UP OR SHUT UP.&quot;
14. THE CRITICAL FACTOR IN DENG'S DECISION PROBABLY WAS
HIS ASSESSMENT AFTER HIS TRIP TO THE US AND JAPAN THAT HE

STATE 046435

COULD MANAGE THE SHORT TERM INTERNATIONAL FALLOUT WITHOUT
SERIOUS RISK TO CHINA'S FOREIGN RELATIONS OR HIS MODERNIZATION PROGRAM AND THAT THE SUCCESS OF HIS U.S. STOP
MADE STRONG SOVIET REACTION UNLIKELY.
15. DENG GAINS AND HUA LOSES IN PARTY SESSIONS. FROM
EARLY NOVEMBER TO MID-DECEMBER, A MAJOR PARTY WORK
CONFERENCE THRASHED OUT HIGHLY-SENSITIVE POLITICAL AND
POWER ISSUES IN AN ATMOSPHERE OF RANCOROUS DEBATE. AT
LEAST SEVEN MEMBERS OF THE POLITBURO, INCLUDING CHAIRMAN
HUA, FOUND THEIR AUTHORITY UNDERMINED:
--HUA WAS FORCED TO IMPLICITLY ADMIT ERRORS AT THE TIME
OF DENG'S PURGE IN 1976 AND IN ENCOURAGING A DOGMATIC
APPROACH TO MAOISM AND A MINI-&quot;CULT&quot; OF HIS OWN; FOR THE
FIRST TIME, HE HAS A POWERFUL COMPETITOR FOR CONTROL OF
THE PARTY IN NEWLY-APPOINTED POLITBURO MEMBER AND PARTY
SECRETARY-GENERAL HU YAOBANG, WHO IS FOR ALL PRACTICAL
PURPNOW THE SEVENTH MEMBER OF THE STANDING COMMITTEE
(HU IS ELEVEN YEARS YOUNGER THAN HIS PATRON DENG AND ONLY
FIVE YEARS OLDER THAN HUA);
--WANG DONGXING MAY HAVE RETAINED HIS POST AT THE HIGHER
PARTY SCHOOL AND AVOIDED DEMOTION FROM THE STANDING COMMITTEE, BUT HE WAS CRITICIZED INDIRECTLY THROUGH ATTACKS
ON HIS SUPPORTERS, INCLUDING THE FORMER HEAD OF PROPAGANDA, A CLOSE COLLEAGUE OF CHAIRMAN HUA'S, AND NO LONGER
OVERSEES PROPAGANDA WORK AND HAS LOST CONTROL OF THE PARTY
STAFF OFFICE, THE OFFICE IN CHARGE OF MARXIST TRANSLATIONS, AND PROBABLY THE CENTRAL SECURITY UNIT (IT IS NOT
CLEAR WHETHER HE STILL HAS INFLUENCE OVER GENERAL SECURITY
MATTERS);

--WU DE, CHEN YONGGUI AND JI DENGKUI LOST ALL SUBSTANTIVE
RESPONSIBILITY AFTER BEING CRITICIZED RESPECTIVELY FOR
REPRESSION OF THE 1976 TIENANMEN INCIDENT, DEFICIENCIES
IN THE TACHAI MODEL FOR AGRICULTURE, AND MISTAKES IN
HONAN DURING THE CULTURAL REVOLUTION (HUA ALSO BEARS SOME
RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE FIRST TWO MATTERS).
--CHEN XILIAN AND NI ZHIFU REPORTEDLY NOW HAVE NO REAL
POWER IN THEIR PEKING POSITIONS, AND NI HAS ALSO LOST HIS
POST IN SHANGHAI.
16. NEW POLITBURO AND CENTRAL COMMITTEE APPOINTMENTS
SERVED TO TIP THE CAREFUL BALANCE OF THE PAST TWO YEARS
IN DENG'S FAVOR. MANY OF THE NEW APPOINTMENTS CAN BE
IDENTIFIED AS HIS COLLEAGUES, ESPECIALLY HU YAOBANG AND
MOST OF HIS NEW SUBORDINATES IN KEY PARTY SLOTS. NEVERTHELESS, WHILE THREE PARTY VETERANS NOW ON THE POLITBURO,
INCLUDING STANDING COMMITTEE RETURNEE CH'EN YUN AND
CHOU ENLAI'S WIDOW WILL TEND TO SUPPORT DENG, THEY MUST
BE CONSIDERED INDEPENDENT FIGURES IN THEIR OWN RIGHT.
17. DENG DID NOT TOTALLY PREVAIL; HE FAILED TO BRING
BACK TO THE POLITBURO AND CENTRAL COMMITTEE CERTAIN HIGHLEVEL VICTIMS OF THE CULTURAL REVOLUTION, AND THE PLENUM
FURTHER POSTPONED SPECIFIC CRITICISM OF MAO'S MISTAKES
RELATEDHE GREAT LEAP FORWARD AND P'ENG TE-HUAI'S
PURGE AND THE CULTURAL REVOLUTION. THESE DECISIONS POINT
TO CONTINUING OPPOSITION FROM DENG'S OPPONENTS; THEY
APPARENTLY ARE DOWN BUT NOT OUT. SINCE THE PLENUM, HOWEVER, DENG'S COLLEAGUES HAVE BEGUN A FAST, HARD DRIVE TO
FINISH THEIR BUSINESS. A CALL FOR EXPANDED DEMOCRACY
INSIDE AND OUTSIDE THE PARTY HAS BEEN ENGINEERED BY THE
NEW DENG-CONTROLLED PARTY DISCIPLINE INSPECTION COMMISSION, WHICH HAS ALREADY ENGINEERED THE OFFICIAL REHABILITATION OF ALL KEY VICTIMS OF MAO BUT LIU SHAO-CH'I.

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
18. IT IS QUITE LIKELY THAT IN 1979 DENG WILL UNSEAT
HIS OPPONENTS ON THE POLITBURO AND COMPLETELY REHABILITATE THE REPUTATIONS AND FORMER POLICIES OF MAO'S CHIEF
CULTURAL REVOLUTION ENEMIES, INCLUDING HIMSELF. DENG'S
STEAMROLLER TACTICS REMAIN RISKY AND PORTEND A PERIOD OF
CONSIDERABLE POLITICAL TENSION. IF ANY OF SEVERAL FRAIL
PARTY ELDERS DIES, OR IF ELEMENTS OF DENG'S PROGRAM
(INCLUDING THE VIETNAM INVASION) MEET WITH SERIOUS
FAILURE, HIS OPPONENTS MAY BE ENCOURAGED TO SEIZE ON A
WEAK POINT TO CRITICIZE HIM, FORCING A MAJOR POLITICAL
CONFRONTATION WITH SUDDEN, UNPREDICTABLE RESULTS.
19. ALTHOUGH CHAIRMAN HUA APPARENTLY HAS COME TO BACK
MANY OF DENG'S ECONOMIC PLANS, HE CONTINUES TO DIFFER
OVER THE EXTENT OF THE PURGE, REHABILITATION, AND
DEMAOIZATION PROCESS. MOST IMPORTANT, HE HAS CONSISTENTLY
DEFENDED DENG'S OPPONENTS AND HELPED SAVE THEIR POLITBURO
POSTS. IN 1979, HE MAY WELL BE ABLE TO PRESERVE HIS OWN
POSITION ONLY BY ABANDONING THE OTHERS AND ACCEPTING A
FIGUREHEAD STATUS WITH NO GUARANTEED FUTURE. THE HEALTH
AND NUING SUPPORT OF HIS CHIEF DEFENDER THUS FAR-AGING VICE CHAIRMAN YE JIEN-YING, A NUMBER TWO MAN IN
CHINA--WILL BE CRITICAL.
20. POTENTIAL STUMBLING BLOCKS FOR DENG INCLUDE A NUMBER
CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL
PAGE 11

STATE 046435

OF KNOWN DOMESTIC POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC ISSUES. BUT FOR
THE FIRST TIME THERE IS SOME EVIDENCE THAT DENG'S
OPPONENTS MAY ALREADY HAVE LOOKED TO FOREIGN POLICY-SPECIFICALLY POLICY REGARDING VIETNAM--FOR A POLITICAL
WEAPON AGAINST HIM. A VERY SIGNIFICANT DECEMBER MEDIA
ARTICLE RESURRECTED DISCUSSION OF THE MOST IMPORTANT
STRATEGIC DEBATE IN NINETEENTH CENTURY CHINA. THE HERO,
WHO ARGUED THAT THE RUSSIAN THREAT FAR OUTWEIGHED ANY
THREAT FROM THE WESTERN POWERS, BEARS A STRIKING RESEMBLANCE TO DENG. THE HISTORICAL ANALOGY SUGGESTS DENG HAS
BEEN ACCUSED (AS IN 1975) OF OVERSTRESSING THE THREAT FROM
THE NORTH AND &quot;SELLING OUT&quot; CHINA'S INTERESTS TO THE WEST
IN ORDER TO GAIN PERSONAL POWER. RECENT REPORTS OF A
SHAKEUP IN THE FOREIGN MINISTRY MAY ALSO BE INDICATIVE
OF HIGHER LEVEL DISAGREEMENT OVER FOREIGN POLICY.
21. DENG VERY MUCH NEEDS CONTINUING PROOF OF THE WISDOM
OF HIS FOREIGN POLICY APPROACH. A SERIOUS DEFEAT IN
VIETNAM COULD BE USED TO UNDERMINE HIS POLITICAL CREDIBILITY. EVEN A VICTORY, THOUGH IT WOULD REDOUND TO HIS
CREDIT IN THE SHORT-TERM, MAY WELL MEAN A BIGGER MILITARY VOICE IN POLITICAL AND BUDGETARY DECISIONS. THIS

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
COULD DECREASE THE ALREADY SLIM CHANCES THAT HIS AMBITIOUS DEVELOPMENT GOALS WILL BE REACHED. CHINA'S ACTION
HAS ALREADY REDIRECTED SCARCE RESOURCES TO THE MILITARY,
WEAKENING THE BASE OF THE CIVILIAN MODERNIZATION PROGRAM,
AND THERE IS NO &quot;VICTORIOUS&quot; END IN SIGHT. IN MORE
SUBTLE WAYS, CHINA'S ACTION MAY HAVE CHANGED THE ATTITUDES
OF FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS AND INVESTORS TOWARD INVESTING
POLITICALLY OR ECONOMICALLY IN CHINA'S FUTURE.
22. THE CURRENT SITUATION MAY ESPECIALLY IMPACT ON
CHINESE ATTITUOWARD FUTURE RELATIONS WITH THE U.S.
SINCE THE EARLY 1970'S, THE MAJOR CHINESE JUSTIFICATION
FOR NORMALIZATION WITH THE U.S. HAS BEEN THE STRATEGIC
CONFIDENTIAL

SECURITY IT COULD BRING CHINA IN THE FACE OF THE SOVIET
THREAT. DOUBTS EXIST ABOUT US INTENTIONS TO STAND UP TO
SOVIET EXPANSION OF INFLUENCE. THE DEGREE OF U.S. SUPPORT
FOR CHINA IN THE FACE OF SOVIET REACTION TO THE CURRENT
SITUATION IN INDOCHINA WILL BE A STRONG DETERMINING FACTOR
OF SUBSEQUENT SUPPORT IN THE CHINESE LEADERSHIP FOR
COOPERATION WITH THE U.S.
B. THE ECONOMY: AN IDEOLOGICAL FOUNDATION
23. THAT THE POST-MAO LEADERSHIP HAD ACHIEVED A CONSENSUS
BEHIND THE AGGRESSIVE MODERNIZATION POLICIES ADVOCATED BY
DENG XIAOPING AND HIS ASSOCIATES WAS SIGNALLED BY THE
OCTOBER 1 NATIONAL DAY EDITORIALS WHICH ANNOUNCED THAT
CHINA WOULD ACCELERATE THE PACE OF ITS MODERNIZATION. JUST
FIVE DAYS LATER ON OCTOBER 6 THE THEORETICAL GUIDELINES FOR
CHINA'S DEVELOPMENT WERE REVEALED IN A PEOPLE'S DAILY
ARTICLE ENTITLED &quot;ACT IN ACCORDANCE WITH ECONOMIC LAWS.&quot;
THE ARTICLE, WRITTEN BY HU QIAOMU, PRESIDENT OF THE CHINESE
ACADEMY OF SOCIAL SCIENCES, HAD ORIGINALLY BEEN PRESENTED
AS A SPEECH BY HU TO A MEETING OF THE STATE COUNCIL IN JULY
1978. THE LONG DELAY IN ITS PUBLICATION POINTS TO THE
LIKELIHOOD OF SERIOUS DIFFERENCES OVER ITS CONTENTS. HU
ARGUED THAT PRACTICAL ECONOMIC CONSIDERATIONS--OBJECTIVE
ECONOMIC LAWS--RATHER THAN THE DICTATES OF POLITICAL AUTHORITIES SHOULD GOVERN ECONOMIC DECISIONS.
24. THE PARTY PLENUM: AS REVEALED EARLY THIS YEAR, THE
THIRD PLENUM OF THE 11TH SESSION OF THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE
ENDORSED THE APPROACH ADVOCATED BY HU AND ADOPTED SOME OF
HIS SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS, INCLUDING HIS PROPOSAL TO
FURTHER DECENTRALIZE CONTROL OF ECONOMIC MANAGEMENT. THIS
SUBORDINATION OF POLITICS TO OBJECTIVE ECONOMIC MANAGEMENT

WILL HAVE A PROFOUND EFFECT ON THE NATURE OF PARTY CONTROL
OF ECONOMIC ENTERPRISES, AND CANNOT HELP BUT ERODE THE
AUTHORITY OF PARTY ADMINISTRATIVE CADRES AND IDEOLOGUES
VIS A VIS THE TECHNOCRATS AND SPECIALISTS.
25. THE PARTY PLENUM ADOPTED A NUMBER OF CONCRETE MEASURES
INCLUDING:
--RATIFICATION, WITH REVISIONS, OF THE 1979 AND 1980
NATIONAL ECONOMIC PLANS,
--RECOMMENDATION THAT CONTROL OF ECONOMIC ENTERPRISES BE
FURTHER DECENTRALIZED, AND LINES SEPARATING THE RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE PARTY, GOVERNMENT, AND ENTERPRISE BE
MORE SHARPLY DRAWN,
--SETTING STATE AGRICULTURAL TAX AND GRAIN PURCHASING
LEVELS,
RAISING THE PRICES THE STATE WILL PAY PEASANTS FOR THEIR
GRAIN BEGINNING WITH THE 1979 SUMMER HARVEST,
--LOWERING THE PRICES PEASANTS WILL PAY FOR AGRICULTURAL
MACHINERY AND PRODUCTS NEEDED TO INCREASE CROP YIELDS,
ORDERING THE TRIAL USE OF TWO DRAFT DOCUMENTS CONCERNING
AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION AND MANAGEMENT OF RURAL COMMUNES.
26. AGRICULTURAL POLICY. THE PROGRAM ENDORSED BY THE
PLENUM CONCENTRATED HEAVILY ON AGRICULTURAL POLICY (SEE
MEASURES NOTED ABOVE), ILLUSTRATING THE CRITICAL NATURE
OF THE RURAL SECTOR TO CHINA'S ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. SINCE
1949 CHINA HAS ACHIEVED SOME IMPRESSIVE RESULTS IN THIS
SECTOR, BUT IT HAS NOT BEEN ABLE TO BREAK OUT OF THE RANGE
OF SUBSISTENCE-LEVEL PRODUCTION. CHINA HAS BEEN A NET
IMPORTER OF GRAIN EVER SINCE THE EARLY 1960'S, AND PER
CAPITA PRODUCTION HAS ONLY REGAINED THE LEVELS OF THE EARLY

1950'S IN THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS.
27. BEIJING'S 10-YEAR PLAN PLACES HEAVY DEMANDS ON AGRICULTURE FOR BOTH FOODSTUFFS AND INDUSTRIAL RAW MATERIALS.
TO ACCELERATE OUTPUT GROUTH--OR, AT LEAST, TO GUARD AGAINST
THE POSSIBILITY OF POOR HARVESTS UNDERCUTTING THE 10-YEAR
PLAN, BEIJING IS STEPPING UP ITS INVESTMENT IN AGRICULTURE,
INCREASING INCENTIVES TO INDIVIDEASANTS AND TO PRO-

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
DUCTION UNITS, AND GIVING INCREASED AUTHORITY FOR DECISION
MAKING TO THESE PRODUCTION UNITS. NONETHELESS, CHINA'S
PROGRAM FOR ATTAINING THE GROWTH RATES TARGETED AT THE
FIFTH NATIONAL PEOPLE'S CONGRESS (85 PERCENT MECHANIZATION,
4 TO 5 PERCENT INCREASE PER YEAR IN GRAIN PRODUCTION) IS
EXTREMELY AMBITIOUS AND PROBABLY FEASIBLE ONLY UNDER THE
MOST AUSPICIOUS OF CIRCUMSTANCES.
28. INDUSTRIALIZATION: THE CHINESE LEADERSHIP IS ENGAGED
IN AN AMBITIOUS PROGRAM TO ACQUIRE WESTERN MACHINES AND
TECHNOLOGY TO MODERNIZE THE COUNTRY'S BACKWARD INDUSTRIAL
BASE. MAJOR PURCHASES OF PLANTS AND EQUIPMENT HAVE A
POTENTIAL FOREIGN EXCHANGE COST OF 40 BILLION DOLLARS
BETWEEN 1979 AND 1985. EMPHASIS IS ON PETROCHEMICALS AND
SYNTHETIC FIBERS, METALS, FUELS, TRANSPORTATION, AND
COMMUNICATIONS.
29. IDEOLOGICAL CONSTRAINTS WHICH PREVIOUSLY INHIBITED THE
ACQUISITION OF FOREIGN TECHNOLOGY ARE RAPIDLY ERODING, ALTHOUGH THE STILL EXISTING BOUNDARIES ARE UNCERTAIN. AMONG
THE MOST DRAMATIC SHIFTS IN POLICY ARE THE DECISION TO
SEND THOUSANDS OF CHINESE STUDENTS OVERSEAS, AND THE
DECISION TO CONSIDER A VARIETY OF SCHEMES INCLUDING JOINT
VENTURES, BARTER AND PRODUCT PAYBACK DEALS, LONG-TERM
CREDITS, AND EVEN GOVERNMENT-TO-GOVERNMENT LOANS TO FINANCE
CONFIDENTIAL

PAGE 15

STATE 046435

THE COSTS OF MODERNIZATION. IN A MAJOR CONCESSION TO
WESTERN BUSINESSMEN BEIJING IS LAYING THE GROUNDWORK FOR
ADHERENCE TO THE PARIS CONVENTION ON INTERNATIONAL PATENT
PROTECTION.
30. FINANCE, HOWEVER, IS NOT LIKELY TO BE THE PRINCIPAL
CONSTRAINT TO INDUSTRIAL MODERNIZATION. WESTERN MONEY
MARKETS APPEAR TO BE WELL DISPOSED TO EXTEND CHINA THE
CREDITS IT WOULD REQUIRE TO FINANCE ITS CAPITAL IMPORT PROGRAM. THE MAJOR CONSTRAINT RATHER WOULD SEEM TO BE CHINA'S
ABILITY TO EFFECTIVELY ABSORB LARGE AMOUNTS OF CAPITAL AND
TECHNOLOGY. THE SHEER SIZE AND SPEED OF CHINA'S EFFORTS
ARND TO CREATE BOTTLENECKS WHICH WILL HINDER THE RAPID
COMPLETION OF MANY PROJECTS. THE COUNTRY HAS A SERIOUS
SHORTAGE OF SKILLED PLANNERS AND MANAGERS AND THE INTERRUPTIONS TO UNIVERSITY TRAINING FROM 1966-76 HAS LEFT CHINA
WITH A TEN YEAR GAP IN THE RANKS OF ITS SCIENTISTS AND
ENGINEERS.
31. ANY RELUCTANCE OF CADRE AND WORKERS TO FULLY EMBRACE
THE LEADERSHIP PROGRAM COULD ALSO BECOME A CRITICAL RESTRAINT.

32. THE 1978 PERFORMANCE. FIGURES RELEASED IN THE CHINESE
PRESS INDICATE THAT MOST SECTORS OF CHINA'S INDUSTRY
INCREASED PRODUCTION IN 1978, THOUGH SEVERE DROUGHT AFFECTED
AGRICULTURAL PERFORMANCE. THE STEEL INDUSTRY, AFTER YEARS
OF STAGNATION, MADE CONSIDERABLE ADVANCES; NEW CHINA NEWS
AGENCY (NCNA) REPORTED ON 10 DECEMBER TOTAL OUTPUT OF
AROUND 31 MILLION TONS--7 MILLION TONS MORE THAN IN 1977
AND 3 MILLION TONS ABOVE THE 1978 PLAN. COAL PRODUCTION
REACHED 600 MILLION TONS--50 MILLION TONS HIGHER THAN IN
1977 (NCNA 29 DECEMBER). INCREASES IN OTHER KEY SECTORS
DURING THE FIRST 11 MONTHS OF 1978 OVER THE SAME PERIOD
IN 1977 WERE:

TONS OVER 1977, IT WAS CLAIMED (NCNA 28 DECEMBER). TOTAL
INDUSTRIAL OUTPUT FOR JANUARY-NOVEMBER 1978 SHOWED A 12
PER CENT INCREASE OVER THE SAM PERIOD IN 1977, WHILE A 20
PER CENT INCREASE WAS RECORDED FOR TOTAL FOREIGN TRADE
TURNOVER (NCNA 25 AND 26 DECEMBER 1978).
34. ON 26 DECEMBEA ESTIMATED THAT THE 1978 GRAIN
HARVEST WOULD REACH 295 MILLION TONS--A 10 MILLION TON
INCREASE OVER 1977. IN VIEW OF THE DROUGHT THIS IS A
CREDITABLE FIGURE BUT FALLS SHORT OF THE ORIGINAL PRODUCTION TARGET. THE TARGET FOR 1985 IS 400 MILLION TONS, A
4-5 PER CENT ANNUAL INCREASE. THE 1978 FIGURE THUS FALLS
SHORT BY ABOUT 4 MILLION TONS. EIGHT PROVINCES, INCLUDING
THE MAJOR WHEAT AND RICE-GROWING PRODUCERS, RECORDED A
DECREASE, BUT HEILONGJIANG (HEILUNGKIANG), ZHEJIANG
(CHEKIANG) AND SICHUAN (SZECHUAN) SHOWED INCREASES DUE TO

CAREFUL MANAGEMENT AND STUDY OF WEATHER CONDITIONS.
C. CHINESE FOREIGN POLICY
35. SUMMARY. THE CENTRAL THRUST OF CHINESE FOREIGN POLICY
CONTINUES TO BE A VIGOROUS EXPANSION OF FOREIGN TIES,
PARTICULARLY WITH JAPAN AND THE WEST, DESIGNED TO ENHANCE
CHINA'S SECURITY, PROSPERITY, AND PRESTIGE. NORMALIZATION
OF SINO-US RELATIONS, THE MAJOR EVENT OF THE PAST HALFYEAR IN CHINESE FOREIGN POLICY, IS A CAPSTONE OF CHINESE
EFFORTS.
36. WITH NORMALIZATION AND THE SIGNING OF THE SINO-JAPANESE PEACE AND FRIENDSHIP TREATY IN OCTOBER, THE FOUNDATIONS
OF CHINA'S CURRENT POLICY ARE IN PLACE. BEIJING WILL NOW
CONCENTRATE ITS EFFORTS ON MAKING ITS NEW ALIGNMENTS WORK
IN ITS INTERESTS. SPECIFICALLY, IT WILL LOOK FOR CONCRETE
RESULTS FROM ITS CALL FOR UNITED ACTION BY CHINA, JAPAN,
THE US AND EUROPE AGAINST THE DANGER OF SOVIER HEGEMONISM.
IT WILL ENERGETICALLY PURSUE ADVANTAGEOUS DEALS BY WHICH
FOREIGN EXPERTISE, EQUIPMENT, AND CAPITAL CAN ASSIST IN
CHINA'S DRIVE TO REALIZE THE &quot;FOUR MODERNIZATIONS&quot;, AND
FOREIGN WEAPON CAN STRENGTHEN CHINA'S SECURITY.
37. WHILE CHINA'S RECENT FOREIGN POLICY RECORD HAS BEEN
DRAMATIC AND HAS INCLUDED MANY SUCCESSES, SERIOUS PROBLEMS
REMAIN. THE MOST IMPORTANT FAILURE HAS BEEN BEIJING'S
INABILITY TO PREVENT THE EXPANSION OF SOVIET-BACKED
VIETNAMESE INFLUENCE INMPUCHEA, DESPITE ITS INVASION
OF VIETNAM AND SIGNIFICANT AID TO PHNOM PENH. CHINA ALSO
VIEWS WITH PARTICULAR ANXIETY SOVIET GAINS IN AFGHANISTAN,
INCREASED SOVIET NAVAL AND AIR POWER IN THE WESTERN
PACIFIC, AND INSTABILITY IN PAKISTAN AND IRAN. FURTHERMORE, WHILE CHINESE COMMUNIST THINKING CONTAINS AMPLE

NENTS TO DEFEAT A COMMON ADVERSARY, IT IS VERY LIKELY THAT
MANY IN CHINA HAVE RESERVATIONS ABOUT THE CURRENT ENTHUSIASM FOR TIES WITH THE WEST. CRITICISM OF THE PRESENT
COURSE COULD SURFACE IF ENHANCEMENT OF CHINA'S SECURITY,
PROSPERITY, AND PRESTIGE IS NOT EVIDENT WITH THE NEXT
FEW YEARS.
38. SINO-US RELATIONS. NORMALIZATION AND VICE-PREMIER

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
DENG XIAOPING'S VISIT TO THE US HAVE PRODUCED RESULTS
HIGHLY SATISFACTORY TO BEIJING. THE AGREEMENTS SIGNED
DURING DENG'S TRIP AND THE EXPECTED REMOVAL OF REMAINING
OBSTACLES TO TRADE WILL PROVIDE CHINA WITH MUCH INCREASED
ACCESS TO AMERICAN TECHNOLOGY, INDUSTRIAL AND AGRICULTURAL
PRODUCTS, AND MARKETS. THE TAIWAN ISSUE HAS BEEN REMOVED
AS THE PRIMARY STICKING POINT TO IMPROVED SINO-US TIES.
AND FINALLY, BEIJING PROBABLY BELIEVES THAT IT HAS ACHIEVED
AT LAST THE APPEARANCE OF HAVING A POWERFUL FRIEND IN ITS
OPPOSITION TO MOSCOW.
39. AT THE SAME TIME, CHINESE LEADERS RECOGNIZE THAT
US WEAPONS SALES TO TAIWAN UILL CONTINUE TO BE A BONE OF
CONTENTION. MOREOVER, DESPITE CHINESE ATTEMPTS TO WARN
WASHINGTON OF THE DANGERS OF DETENTE, THERE REMAINS A
FUNDAMENTAL DIVERGENCE OF VIEWS ON THIS KEY ISSUE. AND
ALTHOUGH SOMEWHAT IN THE SHADOWS NOW, CHINA DOES HAVE
IMPORTANT CONSTITUENCIES IN THE THIRD WORLD AND AMONG
SOCIALIST COUNTRIES WHICH WILL CONSTRAIN ITS FRIENDSHIP
WITH THE LEADER OF THE WESTERN WORLD.
40. SINO-SOVIET RELATIONS. THERE HAS BEEN NO MOVEMENT IN
SINO-SOVIET BILATERAL RELATIONS IN THE PAST HALF-YEAR.
BONTINUE TO REGARD THE OTHER AS THEIR PRIME ADVERSARY,
AND THE DEGREE OF MUTUAL SUSPICION IS SUCH THAT IT IS
CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL
PAGE 19

STATE 046435

HARD TO IMAGINE ANY THAW IN THE PRESENT DEEP-FROZEN RELATIONS. EVEN THE LINK OF THE 1950 SINO-SOVIET TREATY WILL
PROBABLY BE DENOUNCED BY CHINA IN APRIL. ROUTINE BORDER
RIVER NAVIGATION TALKS ARE SCHEDULED TO BEGIN IN MARCH,
BUT THEY WILL NOT TOUCH ON THE CRUCIAL ISSUE OF BORDER
DEMARCATION. TRADE REMAINS A MODEST LEVEL. BEYOND THIS,
STATE-TO-STATE RELATIONS CONTINUE IN AN ATMOSPHERE OF COLD
PROPRIETY; PARTY-TO-PARTY RELATIONS DO NOT EXIST.
41. AS IN BILATERAL RELATIONS, BOTH MOSCOW AND BEIJING SEE
THE OTHER'S WORLD-WIDE POLICIES ROOTED IN PURE SELFAGGRANDIZEMENT, LEAVING LITTLE POSSIBILITY FOR IMPROVED
RELATIONS.
42. SINO-JAPANESE RELATIONS. RELATIONS BETWEEN CHINA AND
JAPAN ARE GOOD, WITH ECONOMIC TIES PROVIDING THE KEY LINK
BETWEEN ASIA'S MOST POPULOUS AND WEALTHIEST COUNTRIES.
WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF THEIR LONG-TERM TRADE AGREEMENT, DUE
TO RUN UNTIL 1990, CHINA HOPES TO PURCHASE TECHNOLOGY AND
INDUSTRIAL PLANTS WITH EXPORTS OF OIL, COAL, AND OTHER RAW
MATERIALS.
A POSSIBLE IMPEDIMENT
MAY WELL BE CHINA'S

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
DIFFICULTY IN FINANCING ITS EXTENSIVE IMPORT WISH-LIST.
43. CHINA VIEWS JAPAN AS AN IMPORTANT ELEMENT IN THE
STRATEGIC ENVIRONMENT IN ASIA. BEIJING, THEREFORE, ENCOURAGES CLOSE US-JAPANESE SECURITY TIES AS A MEANS OF
RETAINING A US PRESENCE IN ASIA. IT HOPES THAT JAPAN WILL
TAKE A HARD LINE IN ITS BILATERAL RELATIONS WITH MOSCOW,
AS WELL AS ACT AS A BRAKE ON SOVIET AMBITIONS IN SOUTHEAST ASIA BY DISTANCING ITSELF FROM VIETNAM AND SOLIDIFYING
TIES WITH ASEAN.
44. CHINA AND EUROPE. CHINA CONTINUES TO VIEW EUROPE AS
THE FOCUS OF CONFRONTATION BETWEEN THE US AND USSR, EVEN
CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL
PAGE 20

STATE 046435

THOUGH RECENTLY MOSCOW HAS CONCENTRATEDEFFORTS ON
&quot;OUTFLANKING&quot; EUROPE IN THE PERSIAN GULF AND RED SEA AREAS.
BEIJING STRONGLY SUPPORTS NATO AND THE EC AS INDICATIONS
OF EUROPEAN UNITY AND CONTINUES TO STRENGTHEN ITS OWN
BILATERAL RELATIONS WITH ALL COUNTRIES THERE. THE RECENT
ESTABLISHMENT OF DIPLOMATIC TIES WITH PORTUGAL AND CONCLUSION OF A LONG-TERM TRADE PACT WITH FRANCE ARE CONSPICUOUS EXAMPLES. CHINA IS ALSO COUNTING ON EUROPE AS
AN IMPORTANT SUPPLIER OF CAPITAL TECHNOLOGY, AND INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTS. MOREOVER, BEIJING WANTS TO BUY MILITARY
WEAPONS AND TECHNOLOGY FROM EUROPE, SINCE NEITHER THE
US NOR JAPAN WILL SELL THESE ITEMS.
45. PRC-TAIWAN RELATIONS. WITH US RECOGNITION, BEIJING
HAS ESSENTIALLY WON ITS LONG COMPETITION WITH TAIPEI FOR
INTERNATIONAL ACCEPTANCE AS THE LEGITIMATE GOVERNMENT OF
CHINA. THE PRC, HOPING TO UTILIZE THE SHOCK OF US
DERECOGNITION, IS NOW STEPPING UP ITS EFFORTS TO COAX
TAIWAN TOWARD REUNIFICATION, OR AT LEAST TO STABILIZE THE
SITUATION AND PREVENT ANY MOVEMENT TOWARD INDEFINITE SEPARATION. THE PRC HAS OFFERED TO TALK WITH CHIANG CHING-KUO,
CALLED FOR COMMERCIAL, TRANSPORTATION, AND POSTAL LINKS WITH
TAIWN, AND CEASED SHELLING THE OFFSHORE ISLANDS AS GESTURES
OF GOOD FAITH. THE MOST DRAMATIC ENTICEMENT WAS VICEPREMIER DENG'S STATEMENT TO AMERICAN AND JAPANESE VISITORS
THAT AFTER REUNIFICATION TAIWAN AUTHORITIES COULD ENJOY
FULL AUTONOMY, INCLUDING THE RETENTION OF SECURITY FORCES
AND FULL ADMINISTRATIVE POWER. THIS STARTLING CONCESSION
SEEMS TO INDICATE THAT FOR BEIJING &quot;REUNIFICATION&quot; IS
PRIMARILY A MATTER OF TAIPEI'S RECOGNITION OF THE PRC'S
SOVERNEIGNTY, WITH THE QUESTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REINTEGRATION WITH THE MAINLAND TO BE POSTPONED, LIKE THAT OF

HONG KONG AND MACAO, UNTIL AN UNSPECIFIED &quot;APPROPRIATE
TIME.&quot;
46. BEIJING'S SERIOUS CONCERN OVER THE POSSIBILITY OF A
VIGOROUS INDEPENDENCE MOVEMENT ON TAIWS BEEN INDICATED
BY ITS SPECIFIC CONDEMNATION OF SUCH A COURSE AND ITS
EXPLICIT DESIRE TO BEGIN CONTACTS SOON AND WITH CHIANG
CHING-KUO, FOR AT LEAST HE SHARES WITH THEM THE SUPREME
LOYALTY TO ONE CHINA. BEIJING REFUSES TO RULE OUT THE
POSSIBILITY THAT FORCE MAY BE USED AGAINST TAIWAN IF ITS
ENTICEMENTS ARE REFUSED INDEFINITELY. FINALLY, ITS HAS
REPEATED PRIOR WARNINGS ABOUT THE UNACCEPTABILITY OF LINKS
BETWEEN TAIWAN AND THE USSR.
47. CHIANG CHING-KUO AND HIS GOVERNMENT, ALTHOUGH CLEARLY
SHAKEN BY US DERECOGNITION, HAVE RESPONDED TO PRC
BY FIRMLY REITERATING THEIR STANDARD POSITION--RHETORICALLY,
RETAKING OF THE MAINLAND REMAINS THE PRIMARY NATIONAL GOAL
AND UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES WILL THEY NEGOTIATE WITH THE
PRC. TAIWAN HAS ALSO REAFFIRMED ITS DECISION NOT TO DEVELOP N;CLEAR WEAPONS NOR SEEK RELATIONS WITH MOSCOW.
PRESIDENT CHIANG HAS ESTABLISHED A HIGH-RANKING COMMITTEE
TO MONITOR THE BEIJING CAMPAIGN AND DEVELOP NEW PROPAGANDA
MEANS TO DEAL WITH IT.
48. A MORE PRESSING ISSUE FOR TAIPEI IN THE WAKE OF
NORMALIZATION HAS BEEN THE CONCERN THAT OPPOSITION FORCES
WILL NOW PUSH HARDER FOR A LARGER POLITICAL VOICE TO
DISCUSS THE FUTURE OF TAIWAN. SO FAR THE KMT HAS MAINTAINED STABILITY BY NARROWING THE LIMITS OF PERMISSIBLE
DISSENT AND ATTEMPTING THROUGH SIGNIFICANT PERSONNEL
CHANGES TO ENHANCE THE PARTY'S APPEAL.

PRIMARY FOCUS OF CHINESE ATTENTION IN THE MIDDLE EAST

RECOGNIZED THE KHOMEINI GOVERNMENT, BUT FEELS IT HAS NO
LEVERAGE IN IRAN. CHINESE SPOKESMEN HAVE COMPARED THE
IRANIAN SITUATION TO THAT IN INDOCHINA AND EXPRESSED THE
HOPE THAT S WOULD ADOPT A MORE FORTHRIGHTLY ANTISOVIET POLICY IN THE MIDDLE EAST. PEKING'S TIES WITH

BE EXPECTED TO USE THAT LEVERAGE TO DISSUADE IRAQ FROM
ANY THOUGHTS OF ADVENTURISM IN IRAN OR THE GULF.
50. PEKING SHARES WITH SAUDI ARABIA THE APPREHENSION
THAT MOSCOW WILL OBTAIN A NAVAL BASE IN ADEN. CHINESE
EFFORTS TO PERSUADE SAUDI ARABIA TO ESTABLISH DIPLOMATIC
RELATIONS HAVE NOT FOUND A FAVORABLE RESPONSE, DESPITE AN
INCREASE IN SINO-SAUDI TRADE. HOWEVER, CHINA CONTINUES
CORDIAL DIPLOMATIC AND TRADE TIES WITH MOST ARAB STATES.
51. PEKING HAS EXPRESSED ITS SUPPORT FOR THE SADAT
PEACE INITIATIVE AND HAS DETERMINED THAT THE CAMP DAVID
ACCORDS ARE A POSITIVE DEVELOPMENT BECAUSE THEY WERE
REACHED WITHOUT SOVIET INVOLVEMENT. CHINESE SUPPORT FOR
EGYPT HAS CONTRIBUTED TO A COOLING OF RELATIONS WITH THE
PALESTINIANS. THE PALESTINIANS PRESENT CHINA WITH A
DILEMMA, HOWEVER. OUT OF A SENSE OF JUSTICE AND IN ORDER
TO GUARD ITS REVOLUTIONARY IMAGE CHINA SUPPORTS THE
PALESTINE REVOLUTION WHILE AT THE SAME TIME SEEKING PEACE
AND STABILITY IN THE AREA TO THWART SOVIET OPPORTUNITY,
BASED ON ITS ASSESSMENT THAT THE PALESTINIAN ORGANIZATIONS ARE DISUNITED AND UNRELIABLE. THE VISIT OF A
SPECIAL PLO ENVOY TO PEKING IN LATE OCTOBER APPARENTLY
WAS INTENDED TO PRESSURE THE CHINESE INTO MAKING CLEAR

HOW THEY COULD SUPPORT SADAT'S INITIATIVE AND THE
PALESTINIAN CAUSE AT ONCE. THE CHINESE SIDESTEPPED THE
ISSUE. HOWEVER, IN PUBLIC PRONOUNCEMENTS PEKING CONTINUES TO SAY IT WILL HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH &quot;THE
ZIONIST STATE.&quot;
52. SOUTH ASIA. THE VISIT OF VICE PREMIER LI XIANNIAN
TO PAKISTAN IN JANUARY AGAIN UNDERLINED CHINESE CONCERN
THAT THE SITUATION IN IRAN WOULD COMBINE WITH INSTABILITY IN AFGHANISTAN AND PAKISTAN TO ENHANCE SOVIET
OPPORTUNITIES. THE VISIT WAS INTENDED TOSURE
PAKISTAN OF CHINESE SUPPORT. CHINA HAS ENCOURAGED
PAKISTAN TO REMAIN IN CENTO AND CAN NOW BE EXPECTED TO
COORDINATE POLICY EVEN MORE CLOSELY WITH ISLAMABAD.
53. DURING INDIAN FOREIGN MINISTER VAJPAYEE'S MIDFEBRUARY VISIT TO PEKING THE CHINESE MADE CLEAR THEIR
EAGERNESS TO IMPROVE RELATIONS WITH NEW DELHI. VICE
PREMIER DENG TOLD VAJPAYEE THAT THE BOUNDARY QUESTION
COULD BE RESOLVED THROUGH PEACEFUL NEGOTIATIONS AND,
&quot;WE SHOULD NOW LOSE NO TIME IN IMPROVING RELATIONS BETWEEN OUR TWO COUNTRIES.&quot; THE CHINESE STATEMENTS TO

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
VAJPAYEE CONVEYED A SENSE OF URGENCY REFLECTING PEKING'S
EAGERNESS, PARTICULARLY IN VIEW OF THE DETERIORATION OF
SINO-VIETNAMESE RELATIONS, TO WEAN INDIA FROM MOSCOW'S
INFLUENCE. VAJPAYEE'S ABRUPT DEPARTURE AND SUBSEQUENT
INDIAN CONDEMNATION OF THE CHINESE INCURSION INTO VIETNAM
REFLECT NEW DELHI'S CHAGRIN OVER THE TIMING OF THE INVASION AND MISTRUST OF CHINESE INTENTIONS. IT WILL BE
DIFFICULT FOR PEKING TO RECOUP THE DAMAGES.
54. AFRICA. DURING 1978 CHINA INITIATED A SERIES OF
HIGH LEVEL EXCHANGES WITH AFRICAN COUNTRIES IN AN EFFORT

CONGO, RWANDA, THE SEYCHELLES, CHAD AND GABON VISITED
CHINA IN 1978 AND SEVERAL HIGH RANKING CHINESE DELEGATIONS
VISITED AFRICA IN TURN.
55. THE VISIT OF VICE PREMIER LI XIANNIAN IN JANUARY WAS
THE FIRST BY A CHINESE OFFICIAL OF HIS RANK SINCE PREMIER CHOU EN-LAI'S VISIT IN 1965. THE LI TRIP TO TANZANIA, MOZAMBIQUE, ZAMBIA AND ZAIRE WAS INTENDED TO REASSURE THESE STATES OF CHINA'S GOODWILL AND CONTINUE THE
IMAGE OF CHINA AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO RELIANCE ON THE SOVIET
UNION. IT ALSO APPARENTLY SERVED TO SMOOTH OVER SOME
RECENT DIFFERENCES WITH TANZANIA AND MOZAMBIQUE.
56. UNABLE TO TE WITH THE SOVIET UNION EITHER IN
PROVISION OF MILITARY OR ECONOMIC AID, CHINA FINDS ITSELF
ON THE WHOLE FORCED TO REACT TO SOVIET ACTIONS. CHINA
CONTINUES TO ADVOCATE POLITICAL SOLUTIONS IN AFRICA TO
PREVENT AFRICANS TURNING TO THE SOVIETS FOR MILITARY AID.
CUBA AS A &quot;CATS PAW&quot; FOR SOVIET INTENTIONS COMES UNDER
FREQUENT ATTACK IN THE CHINESE MEDIA.
57. ALTHOUGH CHINESE AID TO AFRICAN STATES HAS DECLINED
IN THE PAST FEW YEARS DUE TO CHINA'S MODERNIZATION DRIVE
AT HOME, PEKING CONTINUES LIMITED AMOUNTS OF AID TO
SEVERAL COUNTRIES AND HAS A GOOD REPUTATION IN AFRICA FOR
&quot;NO STRINGS ATTACHED&quot; ASSISTANCE. MILITARY AID HAS
PRIMARILY BEEN SMALL ARMS AMMUNITION, COMBINED WITH A
SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF TRAINING BY CHINESE ADVISORS,

MUGABE'S PATRIOTIC FRONT OF ZAMBIA AND THE SOUTHWEST
AFRICAN PEOPLE'S ORGANIZATION.
59. IN JANUARY BEIJING ANNOUNCED THE ESTABLISHMENT OF
DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS WITH DJIBOUTI, A STATE CHINA CONSIDERS STRATEGICALLY PLACED TO HELP BLOCK SOVIET DESIGNS
IN AFRICA'S HORN AND THE ARABIAN PENINSULA. CHINA HAS
ALSO BEGUN PRELIMINARY TALKS TOWARD NORMALIZATION OF
RELATIONS WITH ANGOLA. HOWEVER, WHILE PEKING'S RELATIONS
WITH AFRICAN STATES ARE MAINLY CORDIAL CHINA'S ABILITY
TO AFFECT EVENTS IN AFRICA WILL LIKELY BE MINIMAL UNTIL
CHINA'S ECONOMY IS SUFFICIENTLY MODERNIZED TO ALLOW
PEKING TO COMPETE WITH SOVIET AND WESTERN INTERESTS.
59. LATIN AMERICA. ALTHOUGH LATIN AMERICA HAS TRADITIONALLY BEEN OF LITTLE CONCERN TO CHINA, IN RECENT
MONTHS PEKING HAS SHOWN AN INCREASED AWARENESS OF THE
AREA. DURING A STATE VISIT TO CHINA IN OCTOBER, MEXICN
DENT PORTILLO EXPRESSED WILLINGNESS TO HELP CHINA
EXPAND ITS TIES WITH OTHER LATIN AMERICAN STATES.
60. A VISIT TO CHINA BY CHILEAN FOREIGN MINISTER
CUBILLOS IN OCTOBER FURTHER DEMONSTRATED CHINA'S
AWAKENING INTEREST IN LATIN AMERICA. XINHUA STRESSED
THAT CUBILLOS' TALKS WITH CHINESE LEADERS SHOWED A
SIMILARITY OF INTEREST ON MAJOR INTERNATIONAL ISSUES
BECAUSE BOTH COUNTRIES BELONG TO THE THIRD WORLD. DESPITE RECENT TRADE AGREEMENTS WITH CHILE, BRAZIL, AND
PERU, CHINA'S COMMERCIAL RELATIONS WITH LATIN AMERICA
REMAIN LIMITED.

CHINESE INVASION OF VIETNAM.
63. THE LOSS OF KAMPUCHEA HAS BEEN A SEVERE EMBARRASSMENT TO THE CHINESE AND PEKING CONTINUES ITS SUPPORT
FOR THE KAMPUCHEAN RESISTANCE MOVEMENT. IN JANUARY CHINA
SPONSORED NORODOM SIHANOUK'S APPEARANCE BEFORE THE UN
SECURITY COUNCIL AND FELT IT HAD GAINED A DIPLOMATIC
TRIUMPH WHEN THE COUNCIL IN EFFECT VINDICATED CHINA'S
POSITION BY CALLING FOR WITHDRAWAL OF ALL FOREIGN FORCES
FROM KAMPUCHEA.
64. RELATIONS BETWEEN THAILAND AND CHINA HAVE APPARENTLY
BEEN STRENGTHENED BY THAI APPREHENSION OVER VIETNAM'S
MOTIVES IN KAMPUCHEA. THAILAND, HOWEVER, HAS PUBLICLY
DENIED THAT IT WILL FACILITATE CHINESE RESUPPLY TO THE
DEMOCRATIC KAMPUCHEAN RESISTANCE. CHINA HAS BEEN ENCOURAGED BY THE ASEN STATES' UNANIMOUS CONDEMNATION OF
VIETNACTIONS IN KAMPUCHEA. IT HAS NOT, HOWEVER,
BEEN ABLE TO PERSUADE EITHER JAKARTA OR SINGAPORE TO
ESTABLISH DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS. THE CHINESE INVASION OF
VIETNAM WILL LIKELY RETARD EVEN FURTHER THE PROSPECTS FOR
SUCH NORMALIZATION.

CLOSE AND THERE IS FREQUENT CONSULTATION. PYONGYANG
CONTINUED ITS PRO-CHINA &quot;TILT&quot; AT THE EXPENSE OF THE
SOVIET UNION WHEN IN MID-JANUARY IT PUBLICLY BRANDED
VIETNAM'S &quot;MASSIVE MILITARY ACTION&quot; AGAINST KAMPUCHEA
A &quot;CRUDE VIOLATION&quot; OF INTERNATIONAL LAW AND SAID VIETNAM
WAS FOLLOWING A &quot;DOMINATIONIST COURSE.&quot; BEIJING, HOWEVER, IS RELUCTANT TO APPLY OVERT PRESSURE ON PYONGYANG
TO MODERATE SOME OF ITS MORE EXTREME POLICIES FOR FEAR OF
DRIVING THE NORTH KOREANS BACK TO A MORE PRO-SOVIET
STANCE. IN LATE JANUARY PEOPLE'S DAILY SUPPORTED
PYONGYANG'S FOUR-POINT PROPOSAL FOR NORTH-SOUTH TALKS.

A. DOMESTIC POLITICS
66. THE VICTORY OF MASAYOSHI OHIRA IN THE NOVEMBER
ELECTION FOR A NEW PRESIDENT OF JAPAN'S RULING LIBERAL
DEMOCRATIC PARTY (AND PRIME MINISTER) CAME AS A SURPRISE
TO MOST OBSERVERS, BUT DOES NOT SIGNAL ANY DRAMATIC SHIFTS
IN JAPAN'S POLICY ORIENTATION. OHIRA IS ONE OF JAPAN'S
MOST EXPERIENCED POLITICIANS, HAVING SERVED AS FINANCE

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
AND FOREIGN MINISTERS AND, MORE RECENTLY, AS A POWERFUL
AND EFFECTIVE SECRETARY GENERAL OF THE PARTY. HE IS
ONE OF THE LONG LINE OF BUREAUCRATS-TURNED-POLITICIAN WHO
HAVE EFFECTIVELY GOVERNED JAPAN SINCE THE END OF WORLD
WAR II. HIS ELECTION AT SOME POINT IN TIME HAS BEEN A
FOREGONE CONCLUSION FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS. HIS EXPERIENCE
AND STRONG SUPPORT WITHIN THE RULING PARTY SHOULD ASSURE
AN ADMINISTRATION OF CONSIDERABLE LONGEVITY. HE HAS
PROVEN HIMSELF ADEPT IN RELATIONS WITH JAPAN'S MODERATE
OPPOSITION. ALTHOUGH MORE COMFORTABLE WITH DOMESTIC
ISSUES, HE WILL DEAL COMPETENTLY WITH FOREFFAIRS
PROBLEMS, BUT WE EXPECT HIM TO ESCHEW THE DRAMATIC
APPROACH TO FOREIGN AFFAIRS OF HIS PREDECESSORS.
CONFIDENTIAL

67. ALTHOUGH WITH THE CONCLUSION OF THE PEACE AND
FRIENDSHIP TREATY WITH CHINA AND OF THE CONTINENTAL SHELF
AGREEMENT WITH THE REPUBLIC OF KOREA, TWO LONG-PENDING
ITEMS OF JAPAN'S FOREIGN AFFAIRS AGENDA HAVE BEEN COMPLETED, OHIRA HAS INHERITED A NUMBER OF THORNY INTERNATIONAL AS WELL AS DOMESTIC PROBLEMS AND HIS RESPONSE WILL
HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE PARTY'S FATE IN LOCAL
ELECTIONS SCHEDULED FOR APRIL, 1979. THE CONSERVATIVES
STAND A GOOD CHANCE OF MAKING SIGNIFICANT GAINS, AT
PRESENT, BUT THE STATE OF THE ECONOMY AND OF JAPAN'S
RELATIONS WITH ITS KEY TRADING PARTNERS COULD AFFECT THE
OUTCOME.
B. FOREIGN AFFAIRS, TRADE PROBLEMS
68. DESPITE SOME PROGRESS IN THE MULTILATERAL TRADE
NEGOTIATIONS, CONTINUED IMPORT LIBERALIZATION, AND A
DRAMATIC APPRECIATION OF THE YEN, TOKYO'S ALREADY LARGE
TRADE SURPLUS NEARLY DOUBLED TO 18.3 BILLION DOLLARS IN
1978. THE 1978 TRADE SURPLUS OF 10.5 BILLION DOLLARS
WITH THE US SHOWS SIGNS OF BECOMING A MAJOR POLITICAL
PROBLEM IN THE US. JAPAN'S LACK OF SUCCESS IN DEALING
WITH THIS SURPLUS HAS CREATED CO'SIDERABLE TENSIONS WITH
ITS PRINCIPAL TRADING PARTNERS.
OHIRA'S WILLINGNESS TO GIVE UP HIS PREDECESSOR'S SEVEN
PER CENT GROWTH TARGET HAS CONTRIBUTED TO THESE TENSIONS,
AS HAS JAPAN'S RELUCTANCE TO DISMANTLE ITS COMPLEX IMPORT
BARRIERS.

JAPANESE FOREIGN POLICY, WHICH CONTINUES TO BE ONE OF

LOW-KEY INVOLVEMENT WITHOUT EXCEPTIONAL INITIATIVES.
JAPAN HAS AN IMPORTANT GROWING STAKE IN CHINA'S MODERNIZATION EFFORT, HOWEVER, AND WILL STRIVE TO ASSURE ITS
SHARE OF THE EXPANDING CHINESE MARKET. THERE IS SOME
SPECULATION THAT CHINA WILL BECOME JAPSECOND LARGEST
MARKET, ALTHOUGH PROBLEMS OF FINANCING CHINESE IMPORTS
MAY SERVE TO RESTRAIN A RAPID EXPANSION OF TRADE.
70. JAPAN'S RELATIONS WITH THE REPUBLIC OF KOREA ARE
SATISFACTORY. TRADE CONTINUES UNABATED AND JAPANESE
INVESTMENT IN KOREA IS AT A HIGH LEVEL. RELATIONS WITH
NORTH KOREA REMAIN AT A VERY LOW LEVEL, BUT JAPAN HAS A
STRONG INTEREST IN THE PRESERVATION OF STABILITY ON THE
PENINSULA AND HAS ENCOURAGED THE VERY TENTATIVE RESUMPTION
OF NORTH-SOUTH TALKS.
71. JAPAN'S WARMING RELATIONS WITH CHINA, SOVIET MILITARY
ACTIVITIES IN THE JAPAN-CLAIMED NORTHERN TERRITORIES, AND
CONTINUING SOVIET HIGHHANDEDNESS IN DEALING WITH JAPAN
HAVE SERVED FURTHER TO CHILL JAPAN SOVIET RELATIONS.
MOSCOW HAS EVEN CHARGED JAPAN WITH JOINING AN ANTISOVIET ALLIANCE WITH THE US AND CHINA. WHILE RELATIONS
REMAIN CORRECT, THERE APPEARS LITTLE THE JAPANESE CAN
DO TO RESTORE MORE BALANCE IN ITS RELATIONS WITH THE
SOVIETS. PROSPECTS FOR MAJOR PARTICIPATION IN SIBERIAN
DEVELOPMENT, SO PROMISING A FEW YEARS AGO, ARE DIM AND,
IN ANY CASE, THE SOVIETS HAVE GIVEN LITTLE ENCOURAGEMENT.
72. RELATIONS WITH THE ASEAN COUNTRIES ARE GOOD, WITH
PROSPECTS FOR INCREASED JAPANESE DEVELOPMENT ASSISTANCE.
JAPAN IS, HOWEVER, VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE FIGHTING IN
KAMPUCHEA AND ON THE SINO-VIETNAM BORDER. ALTHOUGH IT
HAS REFUSED TO CONDEMN VIETNAMESE AGGRESSION, IT HAS
SUSPENDED ITS AID COMMITMENT AND CALLED ON ALL PARTIES TO
WITHDRAW. WE EXPECT JAPAN TO PLAY A CONSTRUCTIVE, LOWPROFILE ROLE IN INTERNATIONAL EFFORTS TO RESTORE STABILITY

TO THE REGION.
73. SINCE THE 1973-74 OIL CRISIS JAPAN HAS BEEN INCREASINGLY ATTENTIVE TO ITS RELATIONS WITH THE MIDDLE EAST.
ADDITIONAL AID, INCREASED ASSISTANCE FOR PETRO-CHEMICAL
PROJECTS AND MORE HIGH LEVEL VISITS HAVE SERVED TO IMPROVE
JAPAN'S POSITION. IT IS VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE SITUAT-

ION IN, FROM WHICH IT OBTAINED SOME 17 PER CENT OF
ITS PETROLEUM, BUT IS TENTATIVELY CONFIDENT THAT ITS LONG
RANGE POSITION WILL SURVIVE. A PROTRACTED CUT-OFF OF
IRANIAN CRUDE COULD, OF COURSE AFFECT JAPAN'S ECONOMIC
PERFORMANCE.
C. NATIONAL SECURITY
74. ALTHOUGH THE JAPANESE WERE INITIALLY CONCERNED ABOUT
THE US DECISION TO WITHDRAW GROUND FORCES FROM THE REPUBLIC OF KOREA, SUBSEQUENT US ACTIONS HAVE BEEN REASSURING.
THE SLOWLY INCREASING SOVIET NAVAL PRESENCE IN THE
PACIFIC, SOVIET DEPLOYMENTS TO THE NORTHERN TERRITORIES,
AND THE FIGHTING IN SOUTHEAST ASIA, HOWEVER, ARE MAJOR
CONCERNS. PARTIALLY AS A RESULT OF THESE CONCERNS, THERE
HAS BEEN UNPRECEDENTED OPENNESS IN THE DISCUSSION OF
DEFENSE ISSUES IN THE PAST YEAR, WHICH THE WESTERN PRESS
HAS TENDED TO EXAGGERATE. IN OUR OPINION, HOWEVER, THIS
IMPROVED CLIMATE FOR DEBATE HAS RESULTED IN A MORE RATIONAL APPROACH TO THE PROBLEM AND IN A REAFFIRMATION OF THE
SECURITY RELATIONSHIP WITH THE UNITED STATES.
75. THAT RELATIONSHIP IS IN GOOD SHAPE. WE ARE CONSULTING EVEN MORE CLOSELY WITH JAPAN. WE HAVE ESTABLISHED
A NEW DEFENSE PLANNING MECHANISM UNDER THE BILATERAL SUBCONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL
PAGE 31

STATE 046435

COMMITTEE FOR DEFENSE COOPERATION. THE JAPANESE HAVE
MOVED TO INCREASE THEIR FINANCIAL CONTRIBUTION TO THE
MAINTENANCE OF US FORCES IN JAPAN--SOME 650 MILLION
DOLLARS IN JFY 1979. PUBLIC OPINION IS SIGNIFICANTLY
MORE SUPPORTIVE THAN IN THE PAST OF JAPAN'S PRESENT
LEVEL OF DEFENSE EFFORT AND OF THE MUTUAL SECURITY TREATY
WITH THE US. JAPAN'S 10.5 BILLION DOLLARS JFY-1979
DEFENSE BUDGET PROVIDES FOR CONTINUING QUALITATIVE IMPROVEMENTS IN THE SELF DEFENSE FORCES AND WILL SIGNIFICANTLY
UPGRADE ITS AIR DEFENSE AND ASW CAPABILITY.
76. THESE DEVELOPMENTS ARE COMPATIBLE WITH US INTERESTS.
DESPITE SOME INTERPRETATIONS TO THE CONTRARY, THERE ARE
NO SIGNS THAT JAPAN'S DEFENSE BUDGET WILL CROSS THE
POAL BARRIER OF ONE PER CENT OF THE GNP IN THE NEXT
FEW YEARS. JAPAN'S LEADERSHIP IS SATISFIED WITH THE
PRESENT SECURITY ARRANGEMENTS, AND IS NOT LOOKING TOWARD
ACQUIRING A MILITARY CAPABILITY GREATER THAN AT PRESENT.
MORE FUNDAMENTALLY, THE DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL CONSTRAINTS AND POPULAR FEAR OF MILITARISM REMAIN
STRONG.
III. KOREAN PENINSULA

A. NORTH KOREA
77. KIM IL-SONG, 65, WHO IS IN GOOD HEALTH, REMAINS FIRMLY IN CONTROL OF PARTY, GOVERNMENT, AND SOCIETY IN NORTH
KOREA; HE APPARENTLY MAKES ALL MAJOR POLICY DECISIONS
HIMSELF. UNDER KIM'S REGIME, PYONGYANG HAS BEEN USING
POLITICAL AND DIPLOMATIC MEANS TO PURSUE ITS INTERNATIONAL
COMPETITION WITH SOUTH KOREA AND TO PROMOTE ITS LONG-TERM
GOAL OF KOREAN REUNIFICATION UNDER TERMS ACCEPTABLE TO
THE NORTH.
78. ALTHOUGH THE KOREAN PENINSULA HAS BEEN RELATIVELY
CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL
PAGE 32

STATE 046435

STABLE, NORTH KOREA HAS ALSO BEEN EMBARKED ON A MAJOR
BUILDUP OF ITS ARMED FORCES SINCE THE EARLY 1970'S.
U.S. INTELLIGENCE STUDIES STILL IN PREPARATION ARE EXPECTED TO CONCLUDE THAT NORTH KOREA'S FORCES ARE LARGER
THAN PREVIOUSLY BELIEVED, POSSIBLY NUMBERING 41 DIVISIONS
OR BRIGADES, 600,000 MEN, 610 TACTICAL AIRCRAFT, AND
2,700 TANKS. WHILE MAINTAINING AND EXPANDING THESE
FORCES, NORTH KOREA HAS ALSO BEEN SEEKING TO DEVELOP
SELF-RELIANCE IN THE MILITARY FIELD AND NOW MANUFACTURES
ITS OWN TANKS, ASSAULT GUNS, NAVAL SURFACE CRAFT, AND
SUBMARINES.
79. THERE ARE SOME SIGNS OF DOMESTIC DIFFICULTIES IN THE
PYONGYANG REGIME. KIM'S 37-YEAR-OLD SON KIM CHONG-IL HAS
EMERGED IN RECENT YEARS AS A MAJOR POLICY FIGURE, APPARENTLY WITH LITTLE SUPPORT FROM THE MILITARY. WE ARE
UNCERTAIN, HOWEVER, WHETHER KIM IS SEEKING TO GROOM HIS
SON AS HIS OWN SUCCESSOR OR, IF SO, WHETHER THE EFFORT
HAS BROAD SUPPORT. APPARENTLY, THERE IS ALSO SOME
INTERNAL DEBATE OVER MILITARY VERSUS ECONOMIC PRIORITIEOVER THE EXTENT OF NORTH KOREA'S NEED FOR OUTSIDE
MILITARY ASSISTANCE, AND OVER THE CORRECT STRATEGY FOR
PURSUING THE GOAL OF REUNIFICATION.
80. EARLY THIS YEAR, NORTH KOREA RESPONDED TO A PROPOSAL
FOR TALKS BY ROK PRESIDENT PARK CHUNG-HEE, INDICATING ITS
WILLINGNESS TO RENEW THE 1972-73 POLITICAL DIALOGUE
BETWEEN THE TWO KOREAN STATES. THIS MARKED A REVERSAL OF
PYONGYANG'S POSITION, AS OF THE MID-1970'S, THAT NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE PRESENT LEADERS IN SEOUL WOULD BE FUTILE
UNTIL THERE OCCURRED SOME FUNDAMENTAL CHANGE IN SOUTH
KOREAN POLICY. THE NORTH APPARENTLY HAS TACTICAL MOTIVES
FOR PARTICIPATING IN NEW TALKS, INCLUDING ITS HOPE THAT

REDUCED TENSIONS WILL INFLUENCE THE U.S. TO CONTINUE
ITS TROOP WITHDRAWALS. PYONGYANG MAY HAVE BEEN
INFLUENCED TOWARD A MORE &quot;MODERATE&quot; STANCE BY THE NORMALIZATION OF RELATIONS BETWEEN THE U.S. AND THE PEOPLES
REPUBLIC OF CHINA. THE HISTORY OF DIFFERENCES WITH THE
SOUTH IS SUCH, HOWEVER, THAT CONCRETE RESULTS, IF ANY,
WILL LIKELY TAKE TIME AND COMPROMISE BY BOTH SIDES.
81. NORTH KOREA ENJOYS CLOSE TIES WITH PEKING; BOTH
PREMIER HUA KUO-FENG AND VICE PREMIER TENG HSIAO-P'ING
VISITED PYONGYANG IN 1978. CHINA CONTINUES TO PROVIDE
SOME MILITARY HARDWARE TO THE KOREANS. THERE WERE NO
COMPARABLE SOVIET VISITS, AND SOVIET MILITARY ASSISTANCE
SINCE 1973 HAS REMAINED AT A VIRTUAL TOKEN LEVEL.
82. FAR FROM SEEING ITSELF AS A PAWN BETWEEN PEKING AND
MOSCOW, PYONGYANG PERCEIVES ITSELF AS GUARDING ITS OWN
INDEPENDENCE OF ACTION TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE. BECAUSE
NEITHER THE USSR NOR THE CHINESE ARE LIKELY TO SUPPORT
ACTUAL HOSTILITIES ON THE KOREAN PENINSULA, PYONGYANG
APPEARS TO FEEL THAT ITS MILITARY POSTURE, TO BE CREDIBLE,
MUST RELY ON NEITHER. NORTH KOREA APPARENTLY HAS SUCCEEDED IN DEVELOPING THE CAPABILITY TO ATTACK THE SOUTH, AND
TO SUSTAIN OPERATIONS FOR SEVERAL WEEKS WITHOUT DE
HELP.
83. NORTH KOREA FACES SERIOUS INTERNATIONAL DEBT PROBLEMS
WITH BOTH ITS COMMUNIST ALLIES AND ITS WESTERN TRADING
PARTNERS ($1.65 BILLION) AND HAS AVOIDED MAJOR DEFAULTS
ONLY BY OBTAINING LONG-TERM RESCHEDULING OF DEBTS. AT
HOME, THE NEW SEVEN-YEAR-ECONOMIC PLAN FOR THE PERIOD
1978-84 HAS MORE MODEST GOALS THAN EARLIER PLANS AND
ACKNOWLEDGES SEVERE DIFFICULTIES WITH INDUSTRY, TRANSPORTATION, MINING, AND THE PRODUCTION AND DISTRIBUTION
OF FOOD.

KOREA APPEARS LIKELY TO REFRAIN FROM PROVOCATIVE ACTIONS
AS LONG AS AN EMBRYONIC DIALOGUE WITH THE SOUTH IS
DEVELOPING, AND AS LONG AS THE U.S. MILITARY COMMITMENT
TO SOUTH KOREA REMAINS FIRM. PYONGYANG PROBABLY WILL
CONTINUE TO SEEK TO AVOID THE ANNUAL UNITED NATIONS DEBATE
ON THE KOREAN QUESTION THIS YEAR. NORTH KOREA WILL CON-

TINUE TO SEARCH FOR SIGNS OF WEAKNESS IN THE GOVERNMENT
AND SOCIETY OF SOUTH KOREA AND TO EXPLOIT ANY OPPORTUNITIES CREATED BY CHANGES IN THE SOUTH.
B. SOUTH KOREA
85. SOUTH KOREA'S CLOSE TIES WITH THE UNITED STATES HAVE
LARGELY RETURNED TO NORMAL FOLLOWING SEVERAL YEARS OF
STRAIN CAUSED BY THE &quot;KOREAGATE&quot; CONTROVERSY, AMERICAN
CONCERN OVER THE RESTRAINTS ON PEACEFUL DISSENT IN KOREA,
AND MISPERCEPTIONS OF U.S. INTENTIONS IN CONNECTION WITH
THE CAREFULLY PHASED WITHDRAWAL FROM KOREA OF AMERICAN
GROUND COMBAT TROOPS. PRESIDENT PARK CHUNG-HEE AND
KOREAN LEADERS HAVE BEEN REASSURED BY THE CLOSE CONSULTATIONS THEY HAVE HAD WITH WASHINGTON OVER MATTERS OF
MUTUAL CONCERN THIS PAST YEAR, AND BY THE US COMMITMENT
TO KEEP UNDER REVIEW ITS TROOP WITHDRAWAL POLICY. ON
FEBRUARY 9, PRESIDENT CARTER STATED THAT FURTHER WITHDRAWALS OF U.S. FORCES WILL BE HELD IN ABEYANCE PENDING
THE OUTCOME OF A NEW EXAMINATION OF NORTH KOREA'S FORCEND INTENTIONS AS WELL AS OTHER DEVELOPMENTS IN THE
REGION. THAT ASSESSMENT SHOULD BE COMPLETED BY MID-1979.
86. THE CLOSE ROK-US MILITARY RELATIONSHIP WAS FURTHER
CONFIDENTIAL

PAGE 35

STATE 046435

ENHANCED IN NOVEMBER 1978 BY A STRENGTHENING OF US
TACTICAL AIRPOWER IN KOREA AND BY INAUGURATION OF A
COMBINED FORCES COMMAND, UNDER WHICH AMERICAN AND KOREAN
OFFICERS SHARE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE DEFENSE OF SOUTH
KOREA.
87. SOUTH KOREA'S IMPRESSIVE ECONOMIC GROWTH MAKES THE
ROK A MAJOR PARTICIPANT IN THE INTERNATIONAL TRADING
SYSTEM, BOTH AS A SUPPLIER OF QUALITY GOODS AND AS A
MAJOR AND GROWING MARKET. SOUTH KOREA'S DOMESTIC ECONOMY
EXCEEDED ITS 1978 GROWTH RATE TARGET OF 12 PER CENT AND
THE FOREIGN TRADE PICTURE APPEARS ENCOURAGING. DEPENDENCE
ON PETROLEUM IMPORTS FROM OUTSIDE SUPPLIERS HAS CONTRIBUTED TO HEAVY INVESTMENT IN A MAJOR NUCLEAR ELECTRIC
POWER PROGRAM. AS HAS BEEN THE CASE IN RECENT YEARS, ROK
ECONOMIC GROWTH CONTINUED TO BE GREATER THAN THAT OF NORTH
KOREA.
88. THE DOMESTIC POLITICAL CLIMATE IN SOUTH KOREA WAS
IMPROVED IN 1978 BY THE GOVERNMENT'S RELEASE OF PROMINENT
DISSIDENT FIGURES AND BY FAIRLY CONDUCTED NATIONAL
ASSEMBLY ELECTIONS IN DECEMBER. IN THE ELECTIONS, THE
OPPOSITION NEW DEMOCRATIC PARTY WON A SLIGHT PLURALITY
OF THE POPULAR VOTE, ALTHOUGH THE GOVERNMENT DEMOCRATIC
REPUBLICAN PARTY RETAINED CONTROL OF THE LEGISLATURE.

WHILE THERE REMAIN LEGAL CONSTRAINTS ON DIRECTLY CRITICIZING PRESIDENT PARK OR THE CONSTITUTION, POLITICAL DISSIDENTS HAVE ENJOYED GREATER FREEDOM TO SPEAK OUT ON PUBLIC
ISSUES AND MOST SOUTH KOREAN CITIZENS GENERALLY SUPPORT
THEIR GOVERNMENT AND ITS POLICIES.

DISCONTINUED IN 1973--EVOLVED FROM A JANUARY 19 OFFER BY
PRESIDENT PARK TO HOLD MEETINGS BETWEEN THE AUTHORITIES

CONTIAL
PAGE 36

STATE 046435

OF THE TWO SIDES AT ANY TIME, AT ANY LEVEL. PRESIDENT
PARK APPEARS TO FEEL THAT HE CAN DEAL WITH THE NORTH
KOREANS FROM A POSITION OF STRENGTH AND CONFIDENCE, AND
WHILE SERIOUS DIFFERENCES BETWEEN SEOUL AND PYONGYANG
CLOUD THE FUTURE OF THESE CONTACTS, WE BELIEVE THE ROK IS
COMMITTED TO TESTING ANY OPPORTUNITY FOR MEANINGFUL
DIALOGUE BETWEEN RESPONSIBLE OFFICIALS. SEOUL WILL
PROCEED CAUTIOUSLY IN THESE PRELIMINARY MEETINGS, HOPING
FOR GENUINE PROGRESS, BUT WARY OF RAISING PUBLIC EXPECTATIONS UNDULY.
90. SOUTH KOREA'S DOMESTIC CONFIDENCE AND CLOSE TIES WITH
THE US PROVIDE A FIRM BASIS FOR ITS MORE INNOVATIVE AND
FLEXIBLE FOREIGN POLICY. THE ROK HAS ADOPTED INCREASINGLY FLEXIBLE POSITIONS TOWARD ITS COMMUNIST NEIGHBORS.
ROK LEADERS ARE SERIOUSLY INTERESTED IN ESTABLISHING
SOME FORM OF RELATIONSHIP WITH BOTH PEKING AND MOSCOW.
IN 1978, A SOUTH KOREAN CABINET OFFICIAL ATTENDED AN
INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE IN THE USSR FOR THE FIRST TIME,
AND PRESIDENT PARK HAS INDICATED THAT HE HOPES TO SEE
FURTHER CONTACT.
91. ALTHOUGH THERE HAS BEEN NO SIGNIFICANT RESPONSE TO
ROK OVERTURES FROM THE SOVIET OR CHINESE CAPITALS, WE
BELIEVE ATTITUDES IN BOTH PEKING AND MOSCOW SEEM RECEPTIVE TO DEVELOPMENT OF SOME CONTACTS AT AN APPROPRIATE
TIME. FOR THE PRESENT EACH PREFERS NOT TO CREATE STRAINS
IN ITS RELATIONSHIP WITH NORTH KOREA WHICH COULD BE
EXPLOITED BY THE OTHER, OR CREATE DIVERSIONS WHICH MIGHT
DETRACT FROM THE IMPETUS FOR DIRECT NORTH-SOUTH KOREAN
CONTACTS.

CONTACTS WITH NORTH KOREA IN A SYMMETRICAL FASHION IF
NORTH KOREA'S PRINCIPAL ALLIES ARE PREPARED TO DO THE
SAME WITH THE REPUBLIC OF KOREA. AT THIS TIME, HOWEVER,
IT IS ALSO OUR EVALUATION THAT NO STEP SHOULD BE TAKEN
WHICH COULD DIMINISH THE INCENTIVES FOR NORTH KOREA TO
DEALMATICALLY AND DIRECTLY WITH SEOUL. ALTHOUGH WE
ARE GRATIFIED AT THE INITIATION OF NEW CONTACTS BETWEEN
NORTH AND SOUTH, IT IS CLEARLY TOO EARLY TO DETERMINE
WHETHER PYONGYANG IS PREPARED TO DEAL REALISTICALLY WITH
MAJOR OUTSTANDING ISSUES IN A MANNER WHICH ULTIMATELY CAN
LEAD TO A REDUCTION OF TENSIONS ON THE PENINSULA. MEANWHILE, THERE SHOULD BE NO DOUBT IN THE MIND OF ANY
POTENTIAL ADVERSARY OF THE FIRM, OPEN U.S. COMMITMENT
TO OUR DEFENSE TREATY WITH THE REPUBLIC OF KOREA.
IV. SOUTHEAST ASIA
93. A. VIETNAM DOMESTIC POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC SITUATION.
THE ECONOMIC INTEGRATION AND SOCIAL ASSIMILATION OF
SOUTHERN VIETNAM INTO THE COMMUNIST SYSTEM CONTINUES TO
POSE SERIOUS DIFFICULTIES FOR HANOI. IT WILL TAKE YEARS
TO REMAKE THE STRUCTURE AND VALUES OF SOUTHERN SOCIETY,
AND UNTIL THEN HANOI WILL HAVE TO DEAL WITH A RESENTFUL
AN;D UNTRUSTWORTHY POPULATION. STRINGENT POPULATION CONTROLS ARE IN EFFECT, BUT THERE IS LITTLE EVIDENCE OF
VIOLENT REPRISALS BY THE VICTORIOUS NORTHERNERS. NORTH
VIETNAMESE HOLD ALMOST ALL POSITIONS OF IMPORTANCE IN THE
SOUTH,MAKING REUNIFICATION APPEAR LITTLE MORE THAN A
EUPHEMISM FOR NORTHERN DOMINATION.
94. SCATTERED ANTIGOVERNMENT VIOLENCE, INCLUDING SABOTAGE,
AMBUSH OF SECURITY UNITS, AND ASSASSINATION OF MILITARY
AND PUBLIC SECURITY OFFICIALS OCCURS THROUGHOUT THE SOUTH
BUT POSES NO THREAT TO THE STABILITY OF THE REGIME. IMPORTANT SOURCES OF DISSIDENCE ARE THE MONTAGNARDS IN THE

SOUTHERN BORDER PROVINCES, AND MEMBERS OF THE CAO DAI AND
HOA HAO SECTS AND CATHOLIC COMMUNITIES IN THE MEKONG DELTA
REGION. THESE GROUPS DO NOT COORDINATE THEIR ACTIVITIES,
HOWEVER, AND OFTEN THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN RESISTANCE AND
BANDITRY IS BLURRED.
95. THE LIMITATIONS OF THE VIETNAMESE BUREAUCRACY PROBABLY
ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT OBSTACLEHE REGIME'S ABILITY TO
IMPLEMENT DOMESTIC ECONOMIC AND ADMINISTRATIVE REFORMS.
THERE IS A MARKED LACK OF COORDINATION AND COOPERATION

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
AMONG GOVERNMENT ENTITIES WHICH ARE COMPARTMENTALIZED,
JEALOUS OF THE PREROGATIVES, AND SECRETIVE IN DEALING WITH
EACH OTHER. EVEN THE SIMPLEST ISSUES AND DECISIONS TEND
TO BECOME MIRED IN RED TAPE AND SUBJECT TO CONSIDERATION
AT RELATIVELY HIGH LEVELS. THE CONTROLLED PRESS PUBLISHES
NUMEROUS ALLEGATIONS OF INEFFICIENCY, CORRUPTION, AND
ARROGANCE IN THE BUREAUCRACY.
96. MORE THAN THREE YEARS AFTER THE FALL OF SAIGON AND
OVER TWO YEARS SINCE HANOI'S DECLARATION OF UNIFICATION,
THERE HAS BEEN LITTLE PROGRESS IN RAISING VIETNAMESE OUTPUT AND LIVING STANDARDS BEYOND LEVELS OF 15 YEARS AGO.
THE LARGELY AGRICULTURAL, MARKET ORIENTED SOUTHERN ECONOMY
HAS YET TO RECOVER FROM ITS NEAR COLLAPSE OF 1975 AND IS
ONLY SLOWLY BEING INTEGRATED INTO THE MORE INDUSTRIALIZED,
COMMUNIST SYSTEM OF THE NORTH.
97. OUTPUT GOALS UNDER THE CURRENT FIVE YEAR PLAN
(1976-80) AND THE RAPID DEVELOPMENT OF AN EFFICIENT
INTEGRATED ECONOMY ARE BECOMING LESS AND LESS ATTAINABLE.

AVERAGING ABOUT 15 ANNUALLY AND FOR ACHIEVING FOOD SELF
SUFFICIENCY BY 1980 ARE NOW WELL OUT OF REACH. LAST YEAR,
FOR EXAMPLE, REAL GNP WAS ONLY 3 ABOVE 1974. AT THE SAME
TIME, HANOI HAD TO IMPORT 1.5 MILLION TONS OF WHEAT AND
RICE. IMPORTS THIS YEAR WILL BE EVEN GREATER BECAUSE OF
SEVERE FLOOD DAMAGE.
98. LACK OF PROGRESS IN ATTAINING ECONOMIC GOALS IS
APPARENTLY STRENGTHENING PRESSURES WITHIN THE HANOI POLITBURO TO PUSH FOR MORE RAPID INTEGRATION OF BOTH ECONOMIES
BEFORE 1980. THUS, IN MARCH 1978 THE GOVERNMENT NATIONALIZED THE COMMERCIAL SECTOR IN THE SOUTH. THE ACTION,
WHICH STRUCK HEAVILY AT VIETNAM'S 1.5 MILLION ETHNIC
CHINESE, WAS INTENDED TO ELIMINATE THE FREEWHEELING PRI- MARKET IN THE SOUTH AND TO BRING THE DISTRIBUTION
AND PRICING OF SCARCE COMMODITIES FULLY WITHIN THE
GOVERNMENT ORBIT.
99. FOR THE MOMENT, HANOI REMAINS WARY OF SOCIALIZING
LAND HOLDINGS TOO QUICKLY IN THE SENSITIVE SOUTHERN
AGRICULTURAL SECTOR. MOST ESTABLISHED FARMS IN THE MEKONG
DELTA REMAIN PRIVATELY OWNED, EVEN THOUGH FARMERS MUST
INCREASINGLY DEAL WITH STATE AGENCIES IN PURCHASING
NECESSARY INPUTS AND DISPOSING OF THEIR PRODUCTS. DESPITE
THIS GO-SLOW APPROACH IN EXPANDING STATE OWNERSHIP,
AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION IN THE SOUTH HAS LAGGED. MEKONG
DELTA FARMERS BELIEVE GOVERNMENT TAKEOVER OF THEIR LAND
IS INEVITABLE AND HAVE RESPONDED BY GROWING ONLY ENOUGH

TO MEET COMPULSORY SALES TO THE STATE AND THE NEEDS OF
THEIR FAMILIES.
100. HANOI'S MOST AMBITIOUS POSTWAR EFFORT IN AGRICULTURE
AND AT SOCIOECONOMIC REFORM IS EMBODIED IN THE &quot;NEW
ECONOMIC ZONES&quot; PRIMITIVE AREAS IN THE COUNTRY SIDE SET
ASIDE FOR AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT. THEY REPRESENT
HANOI'S EFFORTS TO DEAL WITH MILLIONS OF URBAN UNEMPLOYED,

AND INADEQUATE POLITICAL CONTROL IN SOME SOUTHERN AREAS.
ABOUT 1.5 MILLION PEOPLE HAVE BEEN MOVED, BUT MANY HAVE
DRIFTED BACK TO THE CITIES BECAUSE OF HARSH LIVING CONDITIONS IN THE NEW AREAS. SOFAR FEW IF ANY OF THESE AREAS
HAVE ACTUALLY SUPPLIED AN AGRICULTURAL SURPLUS TO THE
STATE.
101. VIETNAM'S CHRONIC TRADE GAP - $600 MILLION AND
GROWING - STILL MUST BE COVERED BY FOREIGN AID. THE BULK
OF POSTWAR AID - PLEDGES TOTALING $5.6 MILLION - IS BEING
SUPPLIED BY VIETNAM'S COMMUNIST ALLIES. CHINA'S SUSPENSION OF ECONOMIC AID TO VIETNAM WILL TROUBLE BUT NOT
CRIPPLE THE LANQUISHING ECONOMY. NON-COMMUNIST AID REMAINS
SMALL DESPITE AN INITIAL FLURRY OF POSTWAR OFFERS. MANY
WESTERN DONORS APPEAR TO HAVE BEEN TURNED OFF BY VIETNAM'S
DEMONSTRATED INABILITY TO A THE AMOUNT OF AID ALREADY
LINED UP.
FOREIGN RELATIONS
102.HANOI'S RELATIONS WITH PEKING DETERIORATED STEADILY
OVER THE PAST YEAR. TENSIONS WHICH ESCALATED AS A RESULT
OF CHINA'S SUPPORT TO THE POL POT REGIME IN ITS BORDER CONFLICT WITH VIETNAM WERE GREATLY EXACERBATED BY HANOI'S
INVASION AND OCCUPATION OF KAMPUCHEA. THIS HAS RESULTED
IN A SERIES OF MINOR INCIDENTS ALONG THE SINO-VIETNAMESE
BORDER, A LARGE SCALE CHINESE MILITARY BUILD UP THERE, AND
THE PRESENT CONFLICT BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES. AT THE
SAME TIME, HANOI MOVED CLOSER TO THE USSR HAVING JOINED
CEMA IN JUNE OF 1978 AND SIGNING A PEACE AND FRIENDSHIP
TREATY WITH THE SOVIET UNION LAST NOVEMBER, JUST TWO
MONTHS PRIOR TO ITS INVASION OF KAMPUCHEA.

103.THE USSR AND ITS EAST EUROPEAN ALLIES WILL PROVIDE
SOME ADDITIONAL ECONOMIC ASSISTANCE TO COMPENSATE FOR THE
CURTAILING OF CHINESE AID. AN IMPORTANT FACTOR IN VIETNAM'S DECISION TO JOIN CEMA WAS UNDOUBTEDLY A BELIEF THAT
THIS WOULD BRING INCREASED ASSISTANCE. ALTHOUGH MEMBERSHIP
IS UNLIKELY TO BRING SUBSTANTIAL LOANS UNDER CEMA AUSPICES,
IT SHOULD FACILITATE THE FLOW OF BILATERAL AID AND TRADE
ON MORE FAVORABLE TERMS.
104.VIETNAM MADE EXTENSIVE EFFORTS TO IMPROVE RELATIONS
WITH ASEAN AS AN ORGANIZATION AS WELL AS WITH INDIVIDUAL
ASEAN STATES.DURING THE PAST YEAR. THESE EFFORTS INCLUDED
A SERIES OF VISITS BY HIGH RANKING VIETNAMESE OFFICIALS
WHO ATTEMPTED TO PERSUADE THE ASEAN STATES OF HANOI'S
INTEREST IN COOPERATING TO PROMOTE REGIO;AL STABILITY AND
DEVELOPMENT. DESPITE THESE EFFORTS, HANOI'S INVASION OF
KAMPUCHEA HAS RAISED SERIOUS DOUBTS, PARTICULARLY IN
THAILAND, CONCERNING THE PROSPECTS FOR DEVELOPING SATISFACTORY RELATIONS WITH THE HANOI REGIME.
B. THE SITUATION IN KAMPUCHEA.
105.THERE IS ESSENTIALLY NO FUNCTIONING COUNTRY-WIDE
GOVERNMENT IN KAMPUCHEA TODAY. DESPITE ITS LIGHTNINAKEOVER OF THE COUNTRY IN EARLY JANUARY, VIETNAMESE
FORCES APPEAR TO HAVE BECOME MIRED IN WHAT MAY BECOME A
PROTRACTED CONFLICT. ALTHOUGH VIETNAMESE FORCES CONTINUE
TO ATTACK POSSIBLE DEMOCRATIC KAMPUCHEAN (DK) BASE AREAS,
THE DK FORCES THUS FAR APPEAR ABLE TO SUSTAIN HARASSING
GUERRILLA TACTICS AND HAVE BEEN ABLE THUS FAR TO PREVENT
ANY MEANINGFUL CONSOLIDATION OF VIETNAMESE GAINS.

AIRFIELDS, COMMUNICATIONS POINTS, THE DEEPWATER PORT OF

MANY OF WHICH WERE SIMPLY BY-PASSED BY THE MOTORIZED
VIETNAMESE COLUMNS, HAVE REGROUPED, REGAINED RADIO CONTACT,
AND LAUNCHED WIDESPREAD COUNTER-ATTACKS.
107. VIETNAM FACES VERY DIFFICULT PROBLEMS IN TRYING TO
ESTABLISH A PUPPET STATE IN KAMPUCHEA. ALTHOUGH THERE ARE
NUMEROUS DIMENSIONS TO THE TASK, IT WOULD SEEM TO DEPEND
PRIMARILY UPON: WHETHER HANOI CAN ESTABLISH GENERAL POPULATION AND COMMUNICATION CONTROL THROUGHOUT MOST OF KAMPUCHEA
SO THAT THE HENG SAMRIN ADMINISTRATION CAN BE SET IN PLACE;

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
HOW QUICKLY THE VIETNAMESE CAN TRAIN A KHMER POLITICALADMINISTRATIVE SYSTEM TO GOVERN KAMPUCHEA; AND WHETHER
THIS CAN BE DONE RAPIDLY, BEFORE POPULAR KHMER RESENTMENT
BEGINS TO BUILD BECAUSE OF THE LARGE VIETNAMESE PRESENCE
THROUGHOUT KAMPUCHEA. ON THE KAMPUCHEA SIDE THE BASIC
QUESTIONS INCLUDE: WHETHER THEY CAN ESTABLISH ADEQUATE
SUPPLY CHANNELS OVER THE LONGER RUN EITHER FROM EXTERNAL
SOURCES, OR THROUGH CAPTURE OF FOOD, AMMUNITION, AND
WEAPONS FROM THE VIETNAMESE THEMSELVES AND WHETHER THE DK
FORCES CAN OVERCOME THE DEVASTATING UNPOPULARITY OF THE
POL POT REGIME AND BUILD TIES WITH THE KHMER PEOPLE WHICH
WILL ENABLE THEM TO STRENGTHEN AND MAINTAIN RESISTANCE TO
THENAMESE.
C. ASEAN
108. DURING THE PAST YEAR, AND PARTICULARLY THE LAST SIX
MONTHS, THE FIVE MEMBERS OF THE ASSOCIATION OF SOUTHEAST
ASIAN NATIONS HAVE DEMONSTRATED A NEW DEGREE OF POLITICAL
AND DIPLOMATIC COOPERATION, IN ADDITION TO CONTINUING
CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL
PAGE 43

STATE 046435

ECONOMIC, SOCIAL AND CULTURAL COOPERATION. POLITICAL
COOPERATION IS REFLECTED IN COORDINATION OF POSITIONS IN
DIALOGUES WITH MAJOR INDUSTRIALIZED-NATION ECONOMIC
PARTNERS--INCLUDING THE FIRST ASEAN-EEC MINISTERIALLEVEL CONFERENCE IN NOVEMBER--AND WITH VISITING VIETNAMESE,
CHINESE AND SOVIET OFFICIALS.
109. WHILE THE INDIVIDUAL MEMBERS PRIVATELY DIFFER OVER
THE NATURE AND SEVERITY OF THE THREAT TO THEIR SECURITY,
AS A GROUP THEY HAVE RESPONDED PUBLICLY TO VIETNAM'S
INVASION OF KAMPUCHEA AND CHINA'S OF VIETNAM WITH A STRONG
AND UNANIMOUS VOICE DEPLORING THE AGGRESSION AND REAFFIRMING ASEAN SOLIDARITY. THE TWO ASEAN STATEMENTS TO VIETNAM (JANUARY 13) AND TO CHINA (FEBRUARY 20)--ARE SIMILAR:
BOTH WERE ISSUED QUICKLY, DO NOT IDENTIFY ANY OF THE
BELLIGERENTS, AND REFLECT THE ASEAN MEMBERS' DETERMINATION TO REMAIN BOTH UNINVOLVED IN THE CONFLICTS AND
CONCILIATORY TOWARD ALL PARTIES.
110. THE ASEAN MEMBERS ARE LIKELY TO CONTINUE TO VALUE
THEIR UNITY AND TO PURSUE A COORDINATED, TWO-TRACK POLICY
TOWARD POTENTIAL EXTERNAL THREATS: CONCILATORY DIPLOMACY
COMBINED WITH ENHANCEMENT OF INDIVIDUAL AND COLLECTIVE
DEFENSE CAPABILITIES. IN RESPONSE TO THE GROWING NUMBER
OF INDOCHINESE REFUGEES LANDING ON THEIR SHORES, THE FIVE
STATES HAVE AGREED TO APPROACH HANOI TO STOP THE FLOW,
TO ASK THIRD COUNTRIES AND THE UN TO RE-SETTLE MORE OF
THE EXISTING REFUGEES, AND TO PROVIDE AN ISLAND HOLDING

CENTER IN THE ASEAN REGION (PROBABLY INDONESIA).
111. MALAYSIA. PRIME MINISTER HUSSEIN BIN ONN, LEADER
OF THE GOVERNING POLITICAL COALITION, THE NATIONAL FRONT,
AND PRESIDENT OF HIS OWN PARTY,, CONTINUES TO PRESIDE OVER A STABLE AND EFFECTIVE GOVERNMENT STRUGGLING TO
SATISFY THE OFTEN CONFLICTING INTERESTS OF THE TWO MAJOR
COMMUNITIES (THE MALAYS AND THE CHINESE.)

--MALAY ATTEMPTS TO OBTAIN A LARGER SHARE OF THE ECONOMIC
REWARDS HAVE ALIENATED MANY CHINESE AND INDIANS.
--THE DISTURBING TREND TOWARD RACIAL POLARIZATION IS ALSO
REFLECTED IN THE GROWING IDENTIFICATION OF THE MALAY
COMMUNITY WITH WORLD-WIDE ISLAMIC RESURGENCE. THE MALAY
MUSLIM &quot;DAKWAH&quot; MOVEMENT, AS YET UNORGANIZED, HAS BECOME
AN INTEREST GROUP TO BE RECKONED WITH IN MALAYSIAN POLITICS.
112. DURING THE PAST SEVERAL MONTHS, THE CONTINUING
ARRIVAL OF PREDOMINANTLY ETHNIC CHINESE REFUGEES FROM
VIETNAM ON MALAYSIA'S EAST COAST HAS CAUSED SEVERE
DOMESTIC SOCIAL AND POLITICAL DISLOCATIONS. UNDER PRESSURE FROM WITHIN THE GOVERNING PARTY, FROM RURAL MALAY
CONSTITUENTS IN THE HEAVILY AFFECTED COASTAL AREAS, AND
FROM CHAUVINIST MUSLIM OPPOSITION, THE MALAYSIAN GOVERNMENT HAS HARDENED ITS POLICY OF PROVIDING FIRST ASYLUM
TO INDOCHINESE REFUGEES.
113. IN FOREIGN AFFAIRS, MALAYSIA HAS ATTEMPTED TO MAINTAIN ITS CREDENTIALS AS A NON-ALIGNED NATION. BUT, AT
THE SAME TIME, IT HAS SOUGHT BOTH TO RETAIN CORDIAL
RELATIONS WITH WESTERN NATIONS AND TO IDENTIFY MORE
CLOSELY WITH THE ISLAMIC WORLD. WITHIN THE IMMEDIATE
REGION, MALAYSIA IS AN ACTIVE MEMBER OF ASEAN AND FAVORS
A CONCILIATORY APPROACH TOWARD ITS COMMUNIST NEIGHBORS.

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
DURING THE LAST HALF YEAR, THE POLITICAL SITUATION HAS
REMAINED STABLE, ALTHOUGH THE GOVERNMENT CONTINUES TO BE
ALERT TO THREATS TO ITS SECURITY PRO-BEIJINGCHINESE
AND COMMUNIST PARTY OF MALAYA ELEMENTS.
115. SINGAPORE'S FOREIGN POLICY REFLECTS ITS EMPHASIS ON
TRADE. IT WELCOMES TRADE AND INVESTMENT FROM COMMUNIST
AND NON-COMMUNIST COUNTRIES ALIKE. A SMALL, WEALTHY
CITY-STATE SURROUNDED BY LARGE, POOR COUNTRIES, SINGAPORE
FEELS EXTREMELY VULNERABLE TO POTENTIALLY UNFAVORABLE
POLITICAL CHANGES IN THE IMMEDIATE REGION. CONSEQUENTLY,
DESPITE ITS HIGH LEVEL OF DEVELOPMENT (WHICH IN TERM OF
PER CAPITA GNP WOULD CATAGORIZE IT AS A DEVELOPED COUNTRY)
AND DIVERGENT ECONOMIC INTERESTS, SINGAPORE IS DRIVEN BY
POLITICAL AND SECURITY CONCERNS TO FOSTER CLOSE, COOPERATIVE RELATIONSHIPS WITH ITS FOUR ASEAN PARTNERS ON BOTH
REGIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL ISSUES. SINGAPORE IS SENSITIVE
TO LONG TERM SOVIET INTENTIONS IN THE REGION AND HAS OFTEN
VOICED ITS SUPPORT FOR CONTINUED US AND WESTERN PRESENCE
IN SOUTHEAST ASIA. IN THIS REGARD, SINGAPORE ALLOWS US
NAVAL VESSELS AND AIRCRAFT TO UTILIZE PORT AND AIRFIELD
FACILITIES.
116. THAILAND.
PRIME MINISTER KRIANGSAK, WHO SEIZED POWER IN A
BLOODLESS COUP IN OCTOBER 1977 AND PLEDGED AN EVENTUAL
RETURN TO DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENT, HAS MOVED THAILAND
CLOSER TO THAT GOAL. UNDER HIS LEADERSHIP, A NEW CONSTITUTION RESTORING A PARTIALLY ELECTED LEGISLATURE WAS
PROMULGATED ON DECEMBER 22. NATIONAL ELECTIONS HAVE BEEN
SCHEDULED FOR APRIL AND CAMPAIGNING BY A NUMBER OF RECENTLY RESURRECTED PARTIES IS UNDERWAY. KRIANGSAK'S PROSPECTS
FOR REMAINING IN OFFICE AFTER THE ELECTION ARE EXCELLENT,
LARGELY DUE TO HIS SKILLFUL BALANCING OF THE POLITICAL
FORCES UNLEASHED BY THE TWO MAJOR POLITICAL UPHEAVALS OF
CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL
PAGE 46

STATE 046435

THE LAST FIVE YEARS. HE HAS DEVELOPED IMPRESSIVE SUPPORT
FOR HIS MODERATE AND PRAGMATIC POLICIES. IN LAST OCTOBER'S DRAMATIC RESHUFFLE OF SENIOR MILITARY OFFICERS,
KRIANGSAK APPOINTED A HIGHLY RESPECTED PROFESSIONAL
OFFICER AND CLOSE FRIENDRMY COMMANDER. THIS AND
OTHER APPOINTMENTS VIRTUALLY RULE OUT THE POSSIBILITY OF
A MILITARY COUP AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT THROUGH THE CHAIN
OF COMMAND--THE KIND OF COUP WHICH BROUGHT DOWN THE LAST
ELECTED GOVERNMENT IN 1976.
117. THE GOVERNMENT TO BE ELECTED IN APRIL WILL BE CONFRONTED BY A NUMBER OF POTENTIALLY SERIOUS DOMESTIC
PROBLEMS. COMPREHENSIVE DEVELOPMENT STRATEGIES FOR

ADDRESSING THAILAND'S PRESSING RURAL PROBLEMS WILL HAVE
TO BE IMPLEMENTED SOON IF THAILAND IS TO ESCAPE THE
MALTHUSIAN SPECTRE WHICH HAUNTS ITS FUTURE. PROBLEMS IN
THE COUNTRYSIDE CONTINUE TO FEED THAILAND'S COMMUNIST
INSURGENCY WHICH, WHILE REMAINING CONTAINED, HAS HAD ITS
PROSPECTS IMPROVED BY THE CONSOLIDATION OF COMMUNIST
POWER IN NEIGHBORING INDOCHINA.
118. THE KRIANGSAK GOVERNMENT'S GREATEST SUCCESS HAVE
BEEN IN ORCHESTRATING AN EVEN-HANDED IMPROVEMENT IN
RELATIONS WITH CHINA AND VIETNAM. THE VIETNAMESE INVASION OF CAMBODIA AND THE SINO-VIETNAMESE BORDER WAR HAVE
CREATED EXTRAORDINARY CHALLENGES FOR THAI POLICY. WARY
OF VIETNAM'S LONG RANGE INTENTIONS TOWARD THAILAND AND
BANGKOK HAS NONETHELESS SOUGHT TO MAINTAIN THE MOMENTUM
OF RAPPROCHEMENT. IT CONTINUES TO IMPROVE RELATIONS WITH
CHINA, BUT AT THE SAME TIME, HAS STEADFASTLY MAINTAINED
A PUBLIC NEUTRALITY TOWARD THE SINO-VIETNAMESE CONFLICT.

THAILAND ALSO CONTINUES TO REGARD ITS RELATIONS WITH THE
OTHER ASEAN COUNTRIES AS FUNDAMENTAL AND SOUGHT ASEAN
SOLIDARITY IN CONDEMNING THE VIETNAMESE INVASION OF
CAMBODIA.
119. INDONESIA. THE SUHARTO ADMINISTRATION ENTERED 1979
IN AS STRONG A POLITICAL POSITION AS IT HAS ENJOYED OVER
THE PAST FIVE YEARS. IT SEEMS TO BE PROFITING NOT ONLY
FROM A NATURAL LULL FOLLOWING THE ELECTORAL S OF THE
PAST TWO YEARS BUT ALSO FROM THE PREEMPTION OF OPPOSITION
CRITICISMS THROUGH NEW DEFENSE MINISTER JUSUF'S REFORM
MOVEMENT AIMED AT GOVERNMENTAL CORRUPTION AND POLITICAL
REPRESSION, AND BY THE THIRD FIVE-YEAR DEVELOPMENT PLAN'S
EMPHASIS ON EQUALIZING INCOME DISTRIBUTION. WHILE THE
GOVERNMENT HAS FOR THE MOMENT SEEMINGLY STOLEN THE
OPPOSITION'S THUNDER, IT HAS NOT WON THE HEARTS OF THE
DISSAFFECTED, WHICH CONTINUE TO INCLUDE A LARGE PERCENTAGE
OF UNIVERSITY STUDENTS, THE PRESS, THE EDUCATED ELITE AND
MILITANT MUSLIMS. IN PARTICULAR, THE GOVERNMENT WILL
CONTINUE TO HAVE DIFFICULTY MANAGING THE UNPOPULAR
ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL SIDE-EFFECTS OF THE 15 NOVEMBER DEVALUATION OF THE RUPIAH (BY ABOUT 33 PER CENT) AND THE
PLANNED 50 PER CENT INCREASE IN DOMESTIC OIL PRICES ON
APRIL 1.

WITHIN THE GROUP OF 77 AND THE NON-ALIGNED MOVEMENT AND

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
GENERALLY FAVORS COOPERATION WITH THE UNITED STATES AND
WESTERN NATIONS. INDONESIA HAS DECIDED NOT TO NORMALIZE
RELATIONS WITH CHINA FOR THE TIME BEING. THE GOVERNMENT
REMAINS APPREHENSIVE ABOUT CHINESE INTENTIONS AND INFLUENCE
WITH THE ETHNIC CHINESE COMMUNITY IN INDONESIA. INDONESIA
MAINTAINS CORRECT BUT DISTANT RELATIONS WITH THE USSR AND

121. PHILIPPINES. AFTER SIX AND A HALF YEARS OF MARTIAL
LAW, PRESIDENT MARCOS REMAINS FIRMLY IN CONTROL. HIS MUCH
PUBLICIZED CAMPAIGN TO RESTORE &quot;POLITICAL NORMALCY&quot; HAS
RESULTED IN SOME LIBERALIZATION AND THE INTERIM NATIONAL
ASSEMBLY, ELECTED LAST YEAR, HAS PROVIDED A LIMITED FORUM
FOR POLITICAL DEBATE. DESPITE THESE DEVELOPMENTS, THERE
REMAIN FEW CHECKS ON MARCOS' EXECUTIVE POWER. THE MILITARY AND ECONOMIC ELITES CONTINUE TO BACK HIM, THOUGH
SOME ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE EXTENSIVE CORRUPTION IN THE
GOVERNMENT, PARTICULARLY IN MARCOS' INNER CIRCLE. IN THE
PAST TNTHS, MARCOS HAS INVEIGHED AGAINST CORRUPTION,
REMOVED A FEW OFFICIALS AND PUBLICLY LAUNCHED INVESTIGATIONS OF OTHERS, BUT CRITICS SEE THIS CAMPAIGN AS AN
ATTEMPT TO DEFLECT CRITICISM AWAY FROM HIS CLOSE SUPPORTERS.
122. MARCOS'S OPPOSITION APPEARS IN A QUANDARY. MARCOS'
LIBERALIZATION MEASURES SEEM TO HAVE DEFUSED SOME OF THE
EXPLOSIVE ISSUES SEIZED BY THE OPPOSITION LAST YEAR,
LEAVING LITTLE TO GALVANIZE A UNITED MOVEMENT AGAINST THE
GOVERNMENT. WITHIN THE RANKS OF HIS SUPPORTERS, FIRST
LADY IMELDA MARCOS' BID TO BECOME DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER
THREATENED DISUNITY AND MARCOS SEEMS TO HAVE SET ASIDE
INDEFINITELY THE IDEA OF NAMING HER AS HIS SUCCESSOR.
123. WHILE THE COMMUNIST INSURGENCY CONTINUES TO SPUTTER
AWAY IN A NUMBER OF PROVINCES, THE MUSLIM INSURGENCY IN
THE SOUTHERN PHILIPPINES HAS AGAIN TAKEN A TURN FOR THE
WORSE. IN SOME AREAS, FIGHTING HAS REACHED PRE-CEASE-FIRE
LEVELS. THE GOVERNMENT STILL SEEMS INTENT ON A MILITARY
SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEM, BUT IT IS ALSO EXPECTED TO TRY
TO ISOLATE THE INSURGENTS FROM THEIR ISLAMIC SUPPORTERS

124. MARCOS CONTINUES TO PURSUE A &quot;BALANCED FOREIGN
POLICY&quot; BUT IN RELATIONS WITH THE SOVIET UNION, CHINA,
VIETNAM, AND EVEN JAPAN, THE PHILIPPINES HAS SOUGHT TO
KEEP ITS POLICY CONSISTENT WITH THOSE OF THE OTHER ASEAN
STATES. DESPITE RHETORICAL SUPPORT FOR G-77 POSITIONS,
THE PHILIPPINES REMAINS RELATIVELY MODERATE ON NORTHSOUTH ISSUES AND IT IS EXPECTED TO AVOID EXTREME POSITIONS
AT THE UPCOMING UNCTAD V, (WHICH IT WILL HOST).
125. ON JANUARY 7, 1979, AN AMENDMENT OF THE 1947 MILITARY BASES AGREEMENT WAS SIGNED, CONCLUDING THE ROUND OF
NEGOTIATIONS WHICH BEGAN IN SEPTEMBER 1977. THE MAIN
THRUST OF THE AMENDMENT WAS TO REAFFIRM PHILIPPINE
SOVEREIGNTY OVER CLARK AIR BASE AND SUBIC BAY NAVAL BASE
WHILE ASSURING THE US CONTINUED AND EFFECTIVE COMMND
CONTROL OVER ESSENTIAL MILITARY FACILITIES. AS PART OF
THE AMENDED AGREEMENT, EACH BASE WAS PLACED UNDER PHILIPPINE COMMAND AND RESPONSIBILITY FOR PERIMETER SECURITY
WAS ASSUMED BY THE PHILIPPINE ARMED FORCES. THE RAISING
OF THE PHILIPPINE FLAG AT BOTH BASES ON FEBRUARY 16
MARKED THE FIRST STEP IN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE AMENDED
AGREEMENT.

OF TWO LARGE SOUTHERN STATES AND ERODING THE JANATA BASE

IN A NOVEMBER BY-ELECTION, SHE FACES SERIOUS OBSTACLES.
ON A JANATA INITATIVE IN DECEMBER SHE WAS EXPELLED FROM

PARLIAMENT AND BRIEFLY IMPRISONED. SHE STILL FACES A
STRING OF LEGAL CASES WHICH THE JANATA LEADERS HOPE WILL
KEEP HER ON THE DEFENSIVE.
128. THE INDIAN ECONOMY CURRENTLY IS IN RELATIVELY GOOD
SHAPE, LARGELY BECAUSE OF A SUCCESSION OF GOOD CROPS AND
MASSIVE REMITTANCES FROM OVERSEAS INDIANS. GOVERNMENT
PERFORMANCE HAS NOT, HOWEVER, MATCHED THE HIGH EXPECTATIONS AROUSED IN THE 1977 ELECTORAL CAMPAIGN, AND FUNDAMENTAL ILLS, SS UNEMPLOYMENT, SLUGGISH INDUSTRIAL
GROWTH, POVERTY AND A HIGH POPULATION GROWTH RATE REMAIN.
129. FOREIGN AFFAIRS. THE DESAI GOVERNMENT'S EFFORTS TO
BUILD GOOD RELATIONS WITH ITS SOUTH ASIAN NEIGHBORS HAVE
BEEN RELATIVELY SUCCESSFUL. AN INDO-NEPALI TRADE AND
TRANSIT AGREEMENT WAS SIGNED IN MARCH, AND IN FEBRUARY
1979 DESAI MADE A WELL-RECEIVED VISIT TO SRI LANKA.

130. NEW DELHI REMAINS CONCERNED THAT POLITICAL UNREST
IN NEIGHBORING STATES WILL SPOIL THE PROSPECTS FOR A
STABLE SOUTH ASIA INSULATED FROM OUTSIDE INTERVENTION.
IT PARTICULARLY FEARS THAT PAKISTAN IN THE WAKE OF
DEVELOPMENTS IN IRAN AND AFGHANISTAN WILL SIGNIFICANTLY
STEP UP PURCHASE OF MILITARY HARDWARE AND BECOME LESS
WILLING TO RESOLVE BILATERAL INDO-PAKISTANI PROBLEMS.
131. CHINA AND INDIA SEEM PREPARED FOR THE FIRST TIME
SINCE THE 1962 SINO-INDIAN WAR TO TALK ABOUT FUNDAMENTAL
PROBLEMS, MOST NOTABLY THEIR DISPUTED BORDERS. IN MARCH
CHINA INVITED FOREIGN MINISTER VAJPAYEE TO VISIT, WHICH
HE DID IN FEBRUARY 1979. THE TWO SIDES AGREED THAT THE
DIFFICULT BORDER ISSUES SHOULD ;OT HINDER RAPPROCHEMENT.
HOWEVER, THE DESAI REGIME WAS EMBARRASSED BY THE CHINESE
INCURSION IN VIETNAM DURING VAJPAYEE'S VISIT, WHICH WILL
GIVE MRS. GANDHI MORE AMMUNITION AND MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR DESAI TO TAKE STEPS TO RESOLVE OUTSTANDING
PROBLEMS.
132. THE SOVIETS ARE CONCERNED THAT DESAI'S COMMITMENT
TO &quot;GENUINE NONALIGNMENT&quot; WILL ERODE INDO-SOVIET TIES.
MOSCOW'S FEARS ARE FUELED BY NEW DELHI'S PURCHASE OF
DEEP PENETRATION STRIKE AIRCRAFT FROM THE WEST, ITS HESITATION IN RECONIZING THE NEW KAMPUCHEA REGIME, AE

PROSPECT OF IMPROVED SINO-INDIAN RELATIONS. HOWEVER, THE
INDIANS HAVE REPEATEDLY ASSURED MOSCOW THAT RAPPROACHEMENT
WITH THE PRC WOULD NOT BE AT THE EXPENSE OF THE USSR.
AT THE SAME TIME, THEY HAVE SUCCESSFULLY RESISTED SOVIET
BLANDISHMENTS SUCH AS BREZHNEV'S ASIAN COLLECTIVE
SECURITY SCHEME, AND THERE REMAIN COMPELLING REASONS FOR

LAW ADMINISTRATION HAS MERELY SURVIVED ANOTHER YEAR. ZIA
TRIED TO PUT A BETTER FACE ON HIS GOVERNMENT IN AUGUST
BY APPOINTING A CABINET, INCLUDING CIVILIANS FROM
RELIGIOUS PARTIES, AND BY APPOINTING HIMSELF PRESIDENT ON
SEPTEMBER 16. DURING THE PAST TWELVE MONTHS, THE COUNTRY
HAS BEEN OBSESSED WITH THE BHUTTO MURDER CASE. IN LIGHT
OF THE SUPREME COURT'S DECISION TO UPHOLD THE DEATH VERDICT, A DECISION FOR CLEMENCY RESTS WITH PRESIDENT ZIA.
134. ZIA FACES SEVERE PROBLEMS WHETHER HE COMMUTES THE
SENTENCE OR NOT. IF HE LETS BHUTTO LIVE, HE WILL FACE
THE WRATH OF THOSE--INCLUDING HIS MILITARY CONSTITUENCY-WHO FEEL THAT BHUTTO SHOULD DIE. IF HE HANGS BHUTTO, HE
WILL FACE A PU0LIC REACTION BY BHUTTO SUPPORTERS AS WELL
AS INTERNATIONAL CONDEMNATION. ZIA'S SLIM CHANCE FOR SURVIVAL AS PRESIDENT PROBABLY LIES IN THE FACT THAT,WITHOUT
BHUTTO, THERE IS NO OTHER POLITICAL FIGURE BEHIND WHOM
PEOPLE CAN COALESCE.
135. THE ECONOMY, ALONG WITH OTHER DEVELOPMENT PROGRESS
IN THE COUNTRY, IS AT A STANDSTILL DUE TO THE ZIA
GOVERNMENT'S RELUCTANCE TO TAKE SUBSTANTIVE DECISIONS.

THE TWO GOVERNMENTS WERE WORKING OUT. PAKISTAN ALSO FEARS
THAT THE AFGHANS, BACKED BY THE SOVIETS, WILL ENCOURAGE
THE SEPARATIST SENTIMENT AMONG PAKISTAN'S TRIBALS,
ALTHOUGH THE TARAKI REGIME HAS HAD SO MUCH DIFFICULTY IN
CONS?LIDATING POWER IN ITS OWN EASTERN DISTRICTS THAT IT
HAS MADE NO MOVES SO FAR. PAKISTAN'S RELATIONS WITH INDIA
REMAIN STRAINED, PARTIALLY OVER INDIA'S QUICK RECOGNITION
OF THE NEW AFGHAN REGIME. ISLAMABAD'S CLOSE TIES WITH
CHINA REMAIN VERY GOOD, WITH PEKING SHARING ITS WORRY
ABOUT AFGHANISTAN. WHILE PAKISTAN HAS MADE MOTIONS TOWARDS
REACHING SOME SORT OF AN &quot;ACCOMMODATION&quot; WITH THE USSR,
THEY ARE GENERALLY PERCEIVED TO BE WITHOUT SUBSTANCE
BECAUSE OF OTHER CONSIDERATIONS. PAKISTAN'S PROBABLE
WITHDRAWAL FROM CENTO IN THE NEXT YEAR WILL MOST LIKELY
MEAN A CLOSER IDENTIFICATION WITH THIRD-WORLD COUNTRIES
IN THE NON-ALIGNED MOVEMENT.
C. AFGHANISTAN
138. INTERNAL SITUATION. THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF
AFGHANISTAN (DRA) CONTINUES TO TRY TO CONSOLIDATE ITS
HOLD ON THE KEY LEVERS OF POWER, INCLUDING THE MILITARY
AND THE BUREAUCRACY. THROUGH COMMITTEES TO DEFEND THE
REVOLUTION, ESTABLISHED BY THE PEOPLE'S DEMOCRATIC PARTY,
IT IS SLOWLY EXTENDING ITS INFLUENCE THROUGHOUT THE
COUNTRY. IN PURSUANCE OF ANNOUNCED ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL
GOALS, LAND REFORM IS UNDER WAY AND THE PREPARATION OF
THE FIVE YEAR PLAN IS RECEIVING HIGH PRIORITY.

139. AT THE SAME TIME, THERE ARE SERIOUS SIGNS OF STR
AND INDICATIONS OF TROUBLE AHEAD. SERIOUS DROUGHT AND
FOOD SHORTAGES ARE ANTICIPATED, WHICH COULD LEAD TO WIDESPREAD RESENTMENT. THE OPPOSITION OF CONSERVATIVE
RELIGIOUS LEADERS AND OF TRIBAL REBELS FIGHTING IN EASTERN AFGHANISTAN ARE OF MAJOR CONCERN TO THE DRA. THE
TARAKI GOVERNMENT CONTINUES TO TAKE HARSH REPRESSIVE
MEASURES AGAINST PERCEIVED SOURCES OF OPPOSITION, BUT HAS
BEEN UNABLE TO QUELL THE LOW-LEVEL REBELLIONS IN THE
EASTERN PROVINCES. EXILE DISSIDENT GROUPS, BASED IN PAKISTAN, ARE ISSUING EXAGGERATED PUBLICITY ABOUT THEIR
ACTIVITIES. THE RECENT KILLING OF THE AMERICAN AMBASSADOR
IN KABUL WILL AGAIN FOCUS ATTENTION ON THE DRA'S INTERNAL

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
PROBLEMS AND ITS CONTINUING RELIANCE ON SOVIET SUPPORT AND
ADVISORS.
140. FOREIGN AFFAIRS. THE TREATY OF FRIENDSHIP, GOOD
NEIGHBORLINESS AND COOPERATION WITH THE USSR SIGNED
DURING TARAKI'S VISIT TO MOSCOW IN EARLY DECEMBER STANDS
OUT AS THE CENTER-PIECE OF AFGHANISTAN'S FOREIGN POLICY.
SOVIET INFLUENCE IN AFGHANISTAN HAS INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY, AND SOVIET ADVISORS ARE STATIONED THROUGHOUT THE
GOVERNMENT AND ARMED FORCES. WE BELIEVE THAT TARAKI VIEWS
THE DECEMBER 5 TREATY AS A GUARANTEE OF HIS REGIME'S
SECURITY, BUT THAT THE SOVIETS WOULD EVALUATE ANY CRISIS
SITUATION IN TERMS OF THEIR BROADER FOREIGN POLICY
INTERESTS.
141. AFGHANISTAN HAS STRENGTHENED ITS TIES WITH THE
RADICAL ELEMENTS OF THE NON-ALIGNED MOVEMENT. KABUL WAS
ONE OF THE FIRST GOVERNMENTS TO RECOGNIZE THE NEW REGIME
IN CAMBODIA AND MORE RECENTLY TO CONDEMN THE CHINESE ATTACK ON VIETNAM. IT ALSO QUICKLY RECOGNIZED THE BAZARGAN

GOVERNMENT IN IRAN, AND HAS MAINTAINED CORRECT RELATIONS
WITH PAKISTAN, ALTHOUGH IT PRESERVES THE OPTION TO
ADOPT A MORE AGGRESSIVE POLICY ON PASHTUNISTAN AND
BALUCHISTAN. THE DRA SEEKS TO MAINTAIN GOOD RELATIONS
WITH INDIA.
142. AFTER THE TARAKI GOVERNMENT CAME TO POWEE U.S.
CONTINUED ITS MODEST PROGRAM OF ECONOMIC ASSISTANCE IN THE
INTERESTS OF REGIONAL STABILITY AND ACCESS. THE CIRCUMSTANCES SURROUNDING THE KILLING OF OUR AMBASSADOR HAVE,
HOWEVER, PUT A SERIOUS STRAIN ON RELATIONS. THIS,
TOGETHER WITH OTHER CONSIDERATIONS, HAS LED TO A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN OUR AID PROGRAM.

1. SUMMARY. DURING THE PAST SIX MONTHS, DENG XIAOPING'S
POLITICAL POSITION SEEMED TO STRENGTHEN ALMOST DAILY, WITH
SUBSTANTIAL HELP FROM MAJOR FOREIGN POLICY SUCCESSES.
MOBILIZING RESENTMENT AGAINST PAST DOGMATIC EXCESSES AND
ENCOURAGING RISING DEMANDS FOR RAPID MODERNIZATION, DENG
BEGAN TO BUILD VESTED INTERESTS IN HIS PROGRAM AMONG
GOVERNMENT BUREAUCRATS, STUDENTS INDUSTRIAL WORKERS.
HE SEEMED TO PROMISE ALSO THAT RAPID INDUSTRIALIZATION
WOULD ENSURE PEASANT AND MILITARY INTERESTS DID NOT SUFFER.
THROUGH GAINS MADE AT LATE 1978 PARTY SESSIONS, DENG HAS
BEGUN THE CRITICAL TASK OF REFORMING THE PARTY TO ENSURE
ITS DEPENDABILITY IN LEADING THE DRIVE. HE IS BRINGING
BACK EXPERIENCED PARTY ORGANIZERS, WELCOMING NONPARTY

INTELLECTUALS AND TECHNICIANS AS NEW MEMBERS AND DEMOTING
DISGRUNTLED IDEOLOGUES, INCLUDING THOSE AT A HIGH LEVEL.
2. UNTIL FEBRUARY 17, DENG SEEMED TO HAVE THE MOMENTUM
IN HIS FAVOR BUT NEEDED CONTINUING SUCCESSES AS CHINA'S
LEADERSHIP ENTERED A PERIOD OF TENSE HIGH-LEVEL MANEUVERING
PRIOR TO AN NPC SESSION (PRECEDED BY ANOTHER PARTY PLENUM)
SCHEDULED FOR 1979; DENG MAY ALSO PLAN ANOTHER PARTY
CONGRESS THIS YEAR.
3. CHINA'S INVASION OF VIETNAM, HOWEVER, THREATENS TO
DETOUR DENG'S DRIVE TO POWER AS WELL AS HIS MODERNIZATION
PROGRAM. IT FOCUSES ATTENTION ON HIS ONE MAJOR FAILURE
AND CREATES A FLUIDITY IN THE POLITICAL ARENA WHICH MAY
NOT WORK TO HIS BENEFIT. IN ALL, THE CHANCES OF A MAJOR
LEADERSHIP SPLIT HAVE INCREASED.
4. DENG'S PROGRAM. DENG XIAOPING HAS JUSTIFIED HIS
BREATHTAKINGLY UNORTHODOX APPROACH TO BOTH DOMESTIC AND
FOREIGN POLICY BY STRESSING THE OVERWHELMING ENORMITY OF
THE THREAT OF SOVIET ENCIRCLEMENT. SOVIET-BACKED VIETNAMESE EXPANSION, AND TRENDS POTENTIALLY FAVORABLE TO THE

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
USSR IN SOUTH ASIA, AFRICA AND THE MIDDLE EAST, HAVE
STRENGTHENED THIS ARGUMENT. ESPECIALLY AT THE TURN OF THE
YEAR, MEDIA ITEMS STRESSED THAT BECAUSE OF THIS THREAT,
CHINA HAD NO TIME TO LOSE IN DOING EVERYTHING POSSIBLE -IMPLICITLY REGARDLESS OF IDEOLOGICAL CONSIDERATIONS -- TO
PROMOTE RAPID DEVELOPMENT OF ITS ECONOMIC AND MILITARY
STRENGTH, AND TO ENSURE ITS SECURITY DURING THE NEXT
TWENTY YEARS OF CONTINUING RELATIVE WEAKNESS.
5. THE ANTI-SOVIET THEME CAN EE DETECTED IN
PEKING'S CONCILIATORY APPROACH TO TAIPEI -- SO CRITICAL
TO NORMALIZATION OF U.S.-CHINA RELATIONS --WHICH STRESSES
THAT NATIONAL PATRIOTISM PROVIDES A GOOD BASIS FOR PRCCONFIDENTIAL

TAIWAN RECONCILIATION. DENG'S WILLINGNESS TO ALLOW
TAIWAN TO RETAIN ITS ARMED FORCES UNDERCUTS &quot;ON RECORD&quot;
OPPOSITION TO US ARMS SALES TO TAIWAN, AND IN CONTEXT
ALMOST SUGGESTS TAIWAN, ALONG WITH THE US AND JAPAN, CAN
BE PART OF THE ANTI-SOVIET FRONT.
6. SEVERAL ASPECTS OF DENG XIAOPING'S DOMESTIC PROGRAM -AIMED PRIMARILY AT INCREASING PRODUCTIVITY -- FIT WELL
WITH THIS MESSAGE TO TAIWAN:
-- DENG HAS MOVED RAPIDLY TO GUT THE CONCEPT OF &quot;CLASS
STRUGGLE&quot; BETWEEN THE &quot;PEOPLE&quot; AND THE &quot;ENEMY&quot; BY
GIVING AMNESTY TO FORMER LANDLORDS, INDUSTRIALISTS,
AND RIGHTISTS, REDEFINING THEM AND OTHER PREVIOUSLY
SUSPECT GROUPS SUCH AS INTELLECTUALS, RETURNED OVERSEAS CHINESE, AND RELIGIOUS ETHNIC MINORITIES (AND
IMPLICITLY THE &quot;BOURGEOISIE&quot; ON TAIWAN) AS &quot;PEOPLE&quot;
ON THE BASIS OF PATRIOTIC WILLINGNESS TO WORK FOR
ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT;
-- RECENT REFERENCES IN THE MEDIA AND THE COMMUNIQUE OF
THE DECEMBER PARTY PLENUM TO &quot;PEOPLE'S DEMOCRACY&quot;
RATHER THAN &quot;SOCIALIST DEMOCRACY&quot; HARK BACK TO THE
EARLY 1950'S WHEN, IN DEFIANCE OF SOVIET DOCTRINE,
MAO HELD THAT CHINA COULD EVOLVE GRADUALLY AND PEACEFULLY TOWARD SOCIALISM, NOT UNDER A &quot;DICTATORSHIP OF
THE PROLETARIAT&quot; (A COALITION OF THE PROLETARIAT, THE
PEASANTRY, AND THE BOURGEOISIE -- WHICH COULD INCLUDE
KMT PATRIOTS);
-- THE NEW LIBERALIZATION IN CULTURAL AND INTELLECTUAL
MATTERS AND GREATER VENTILATION OF DISSENTING VIEWS
ALSO SERVES TO CONVINCE THE WORLD (INCLUDING TAIWAN)

THERE IS SAFETY IN COOPERATION WITH A &quot;NEW&quot; CHINA.
7. THESE TRENDS -- WHICH EFFECTIVELY CITE MAO'S EARLY
WORKS TO REPUDIATE THE POLICIES OF THE LAST TWENTRS-MAY WELL BE STRENGTHENED BY REWRITES OF BOTH THE PARTY AND
STATE CONSTITUTIONS AT MAJOR PARTY AND GOVERNMENT SESSIONS
IN TIME FOR THE CELEBRATION OF THE THIRTIETH ANNIVERSARY
OF THE PRC ON OCTOBER 1.
8. LARGE ELEMENTS OF DENG XIAOPING'S PROGRAM COULD ENGENDER SERIOUS OPPOSITION, HOWEVER, ALONG THE LINES OF THE
READY-MADE MAOIST CRITIQUE, IF, FOR EXAMPLE:
-- DENG'S APPROACH TO DEVELOPMENT, BASED ON MASSIVE
FOREIGN IMPORTS, WERE SERIOUSLY IMPAIRED BY SOME COMBINATION OF BAD WEATHER, AN UNFAVORABLE INTERNATIONAL
ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT, LACK OF OIL RESERVES, OR AN
INABILITY OF CHINA'S EXPERTISE-POOR, BUREAUCRACYRIDDEN SYSTEM TO ABSORB AND TRANSFORM FOREIGN TECHNOLOGY AND CAPITAL;
-- IN THE NEAR FUTURE, THERE WERE SIGNIFICANT SETBACKS IN
THE EVOLUTION OF THE NEW US-CHINA RELATIONSHIP.
9. DEBATING VIETNAM POLICY. THE MOST OBVIOUS AND
IMMEDIATE FLAW IN DENG'S PROGRAM IS THE DANGER OF WAR
INHERENT IN ITS LOGIC. BEFORE MID-JANUARY, THE CHINESE
LEADERSHIP HOPED TO AVOID MILITARY CONFRONTATION WITH
VIETNAM IN RECOGNITION OF PLA WEAKNESS, IN DEFERENCE TO
MODERNIZATION, AND IN ORDER TO USE DIPLOMACY TO BRING
INTERNATIONAL &quot;UNITED FRONT&quot; PRESSURE TO BEAR ON THE USSR
AND VIETNAM. BUT THROUGHOUT 1978, THERE WERE SIGNS OF
INDECISION REGARDING THE ASSESSMENT OF THE INTERNATIONAL
SITUATION AND THE THREAT TO CHINA (AND PROBABLY, THEREFORE, HOW TO HANDLE IT). THIS BECAME ESPECIALLY EVIDENT
AT THE TURN OF THE YEAR WHEN:

-- THE LATE DECEMBER PARTY PLENUM COMMUNIQUE MADE AN
UNUSUAL REFERENCE TO THE NEED TO STRENGTHEN NATIONAL
DEFENSE IN ORDER TO REPULSE &quot;AT ANY MOMENT&quot; AGGRESSORS
FROM &quot;ANY DIRECTION,&quot; IMPLYING CHINA IS FACED WITH A
SERIOUS THREAT IN THE SOUTH, BUT

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
-- THE ANNUAL NEW YEAR EDITORIAL MADE AN UNPRECEDENTED
OMISSION OF DISCUSSION OF THE INTERNATIONAL SITUATION
AND THE SOVIET THREAT TO CHINA; AN
-- DENG ON JANUARY 1 SEEMED LESS CONCERNED ABOUT AN
IMMINENT THREAT, SPOKE OF VIETNAMESE &quot;SMALL HEGEMONISM&quot;
AS MERELY &quot;MAKING TROUBLE,&quot; MADE NO REFERENCE TO MILITARY PREPAREDNESS, AND POINTEDLY DECLARED THAT THE
THREAT TO PEACE AND POSSIBLITY OF AGRESSION CAME ONLY
&quot;FROM THE NORTH.&quot;
10. DENG MAY HAVE BEEN URGING MILITARY RESTRAINT TOWARD
VIETNAM, STRESSING DIPLOMATIC EFFORTS TO AVOID PROVOKING
A SOVIET REACTION OR ALARMING CHINA'S NEW FRIENDS. THIS
HYPOTHESIS IS SUPPORTED BY DENG.S EARLY JANUARY COMMENTS
TO VISITORS WHICH IMPLICITLY REJECTED AN IMMEDIATE
CHINESE INTERVENTION.
11. THERE IS LITTLE INFORMATION ABOUT THE ARGUMENTS PUT
FORTH WHICH LED TO THE CONSENSUS TO INITIATE A QUICK
STRIKE &quot;LIMITED IN TIME AND SPACE.&quot; THE CONSENSUS WAS NO
DOUBT CEMENTED BY EMOTIONAL REACTION TO PERCEIVED VIETNAMESE INGRATITUDE AND PERFIDY. IT IS LIKELY THAT DENG
XIAOPING'S CHOICES WERE SHAPED BY STRONG ARGUMENTS FROM
KEY CENTRAL AND REGIONAL MILITARY FIGURES IN FAVOR OF
INTERVENTION IN RESPONSE TO INSULTING SOVIET-VIETNAMESE
CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL
PAGE 07

STATE 046435

PROVOCATIONS IN ORDER TO DEFEND THE REPUTATION OF THE PRC
AND THE PLA, AND TO FOREWARN THE USSR AND VIETNAM THAT
CHINA WILL DEFEND ITS INTERESTS WITH FORCE. MAOISTS,
INCLUDING VICE CHAIRMAN WAN DONGXING AND PERHAPS ALSO
CHAIRMAN HUA, PROBABLY HAD LITTLE INFLUENCE ON THE DECISION BUT MAY HAVE AGREED TO INTERVENTION IN THE HOPE OF
RELIEVING PRESSURE ON THE KAMPUCHEAN RESISTANCE MOVEMENT
LED BY POL POT (FOR WHOM THEY HAVE SHOWN SPECIAL CONCERN);
THEY HAVE LITTLE TO LOSE AND MUCH TO GAIN POLITICALLY IF
DENG'S POLICIES SUFFER A SETBACK AS A RESULT. FOREIGN
AFFAIRS SPECIALISTS AND CLOSE ASSOCIATES OF THE LATE
PREMIER CHOU ENLAI -- LIKE VICE CHAIRMAN YE JIANYING AND
LI XIANNIAN AND THE NEWLY-APPOINTED SECRETARY-GENERAL
OF THE MILITARY COMMISSION -- PROBABLY HELD OUT LONGEST,
FEARING DAMAGE TO CHINA'S ECONOMY APLOMACY.
12. DENG'S 1978 HARD LINE TOWARD VIETNAM AS THE &quot;CUBA OF
ASIA&quot; WAS FOLLOWED BY A MILITARY BUILDUP ALONG THE BORDER,
PROBABLY AGREED TO BY CIVILIAN LEADERS ON THE GROUNDS THAT
A CREDIBLE THREAT OF FORCE WOULD BUTTRESS DIPLOMATIC
EFFORTS TO PERSUADE VIETNAM TO MEND ITS WAYS. DENG THUS
COULD BUILD POLITICAL SUPPORT WITHIN BOTH GROUPS FOR HIS
GENERAL PROGRAM, INCLUDING STRENGTHENED TIES WITH THE

WEST.
13. BUT DENG'S POLICY WAS FOUND WANTING WHEN HANOI JOINED
CEMA, SIGNED A TREATY WITH THE USSR, TOOK THE OPPORTUNITY
OF THE US-CHINA NORMALIZATION PROCESS TO INVADE KAMPUCHEA,
ON THE ASSUMPTION CHINA'S REACTION WOULD BE RESTRAINED.
AT THAT POINT, DENG'S ATTACKS ON &quot;APPEASEMENT&quot; ELSEWHERE
MADE CHINESE INACTION LOOK HYPOCRITICAL AND SOLE RELIANCE
ON DIPLOMACY APPEAR INEFFECTUAL. THE MILITARY COULD ARGUE
PERSUASIVELY THAT CHINA MUST &quot;PUT UP OR SHUT UP.&quot;
14. THE CRITICAL FACTOR IN DENG'S DECISION PROBABLY WAS
HIS ASSESSMENT AFTER HIS TRIP TO THE US AND JAPAN THAT HE
CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL
PAGE 08

STATE 046435

COULD MANAGE THE SHORT TERM INTERNATIONAL FALLOUT WITHOUT
SERIOUS RISK TO CHINA'S FOREIGN RELATIONS OR HIS MODERNIZATION PROGRAM AND THAT THE SUCCESS OF HIS U.S. STOP
MADE STRONG SOVIET REACTION UNLIKELY.
15. DENG GAINS AND HUA LOSES IN PARTY SESSIONS. FROM
EARLY NOVEMBER TO MID-DECEMBER, A MAJOR PARTY WORK
CONFERENCE THRASHED OUT HIGHLY-SENSITIVE POLITICAL AND
POWER ISSUES IN AN ATMOSPHERE OF RANCOROUS DEBATE. AT
LEAST SEVEN MEMBERS OF THE POLITBURO, INCLUDING CHAIRMAN
HUA, FOUND THEIR AUTHORITY UNDERMINED:
--HUA WAS FORCED TO IMPLICITLY ADMIT ERRORS AT THE TIME
OF DENG'S PURGE IN 1976 AND IN ENCOURAGING A DOGMATIC
APPROACH TO MAOISM AND A MINI-&quot;CULT&quot; OF HIS OWN; FOR THE
FIRST TIME, HE HAS A POWERFUL COMPETITOR FOR CONTROL OF
THE PARTY IN NEWLY-APPOINTED POLITBURO MEMBER AND PARTY
SECRETARY-GENERAL HU YAOBANG, WHO IS FOR ALL PRACTICAL
PURPNOW THE SEVENTH MEMBER OF THE STANDING COMMITTEE
(HU IS ELEVEN YEARS YOUNGER THAN HIS PATRON DENG AND ONLY
FIVE YEARS OLDER THAN HUA);
--WANG DONGXING MAY HAVE RETAINED HIS POST AT THE HIGHER
PARTY SCHOOL AND AVOIDED DEMOTION FROM THE STANDING COMMITTEE, BUT HE WAS CRITICIZED INDIRECTLY THROUGH ATTACKS
ON HIS SUPPORTERS, INCLUDING THE FORMER HEAD OF PROPAGANDA, A CLOSE COLLEAGUE OF CHAIRMAN HUA'S, AND NO LONGER
OVERSEES PROPAGANDA WORK AND HAS LOST CONTROL OF THE PARTY
STAFF OFFICE, THE OFFICE IN CHARGE OF MARXIST TRANSLATIONS, AND PROBABLY THE CENTRAL SECURITY UNIT (IT IS NOT
CLEAR WHETHER HE STILL HAS INFLUENCE OVER GENERAL SECURITY
MATTERS);

--WU DE, CHEN YONGGUI AND JI DENGKUI LOST ALL SUBSTANTIVE
RESPONSIBILITY AFTER BEING CRITICIZED RESPECTIVELY FOR
REPRESSION OF THE 1976 TIENANMEN INCIDENT, DEFICIENCIES
IN THE TACHAI MODEL FOR AGRICULTURE, AND MISTAKES IN
HONAN DURING THE CULTURAL REVOLUTION (HUA ALSO BEARS SOME
RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE FIRST TWO MATTERS).
--CHEN XILIAN AND NI ZHIFU REPORTEDLY NOW HAVE NO REAL
POWER IN THEIR PEKING POSITIONS, AND NI HAS ALSO LOST HIS
POST IN SHANGHAI.
16. NEW POLITBURO AND CENTRAL COMMITTEE APPOINTMENTS
SERVED TO TIP THE CAREFUL BALANCE OF THE PAST TWO YEARS
IN DENG'S FAVOR. MANY OF THE NEW APPOINTMENTS CAN BE
IDENTIFIED AS HIS COLLEAGUES, ESPECIALLY HU YAOBANG AND
MOST OF HIS NEW SUBORDINATES IN KEY PARTY SLOTS. NEVERTHELESS, WHILE THREE PARTY VETERANS NOW ON THE POLITBURO,
INCLUDING STANDING COMMITTEE RETURNEE CH'EN YUN AND
CHOU ENLAI'S WIDOW WILL TEND TO SUPPORT DENG, THEY MUST
BE CONSIDERED INDEPENDENT FIGURES IN THEIR OWN RIGHT.
17. DENG DID NOT TOTALLY PREVAIL; HE FAILED TO BRING
BACK TO THE POLITBURO AND CENTRAL COMMITTEE CERTAIN HIGHLEVEL VICTIMS OF THE CULTURAL REVOLUTION, AND THE PLENUM
FURTHER POSTPONED SPECIFIC CRITICISM OF MAO'S MISTAKES
RELATEDHE GREAT LEAP FORWARD AND P'ENG TE-HUAI'S
PURGE AND THE CULTURAL REVOLUTION. THESE DECISIONS POINT
TO CONTINUING OPPOSITION FROM DENG'S OPPONENTS; THEY
APPARENTLY ARE DOWN BUT NOT OUT. SINCE THE PLENUM, HOWEVER, DENG'S COLLEAGUES HAVE BEGUN A FAST, HARD DRIVE TO
FINISH THEIR BUSINESS. A CALL FOR EXPANDED DEMOCRACY
INSIDE AND OUTSIDE THE PARTY HAS BEEN ENGINEERED BY THE
NEW DENG-CONTROLLED PARTY DISCIPLINE INSPECTION COMMISSION, WHICH HAS ALREADY ENGINEERED THE OFFICIAL REHABILITATION OF ALL KEY VICTIMS OF MAO BUT LIU SHAO-CH'I.

THEIR CAMPAIGN IS INCREASINGLY AIMED AT WANG DONGXING.
WANG AND HIS PREDECESSORS IN SECURITY WORK ARE LIKELY
SOON TO JOIN THE LIST OF SCAPEGOATS FOR THE 'FEUDAL
FASCIST DICTATORSHIP&quot; IN CHINA DURING THE LAST FIFTEEN
YEARS.
STABILITY AND UNITY REMAIN ELUSIVE

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
18. IT IS QUITE LIKELY THAT IN 1979 DENG WILL UNSEAT
HIS OPPONENTS ON THE POLITBURO AND COMPLETELY REHABILITATE THE REPUTATIONS AND FORMER POLICIES OF MAO'S CHIEF
CULTURAL REVOLUTION ENEMIES, INCLUDING HIMSELF. DENG'S
STEAMROLLER TACTICS REMAIN RISKY AND PORTEND A PERIOD OF
CONSIDERABLE POLITICAL TENSION. IF ANY OF SEVERAL FRAIL
PARTY ELDERS DIES, OR IF ELEMENTS OF DENG'S PROGRAM
(INCLUDING THE VIETNAM INVASION) MEET WITH SERIOUS
FAILURE, HIS OPPONENTS MAY BE ENCOURAGED TO SEIZE ON A
WEAK POINT TO CRITICIZE HIM, FORCING A MAJOR POLITICAL
CONFRONTATION WITH SUDDEN, UNPREDICTABLE RESULTS.
19. ALTHOUGH CHAIRMAN HUA APPARENTLY HAS COME TO BACK
MANY OF DENG'S ECONOMIC PLANS, HE CONTINUES TO DIFFER
OVER THE EXTENT OF THE PURGE, REHABILITATION, AND
DEMAOIZATION PROCESS. MOST IMPORTANT, HE HAS CONSISTENTLY
DEFENDED DENG'S OPPONENTS AND HELPED SAVE THEIR POLITBURO
POSTS. IN 1979, HE MAY WELL BE ABLE TO PRESERVE HIS OWN
POSITION ONLY BY ABANDONING THE OTHERS AND ACCEPTING A
FIGUREHEAD STATUS WITH NO GUARANTEED FUTURE. THE HEALTH
AND NUING SUPPORT OF HIS CHIEF DEFENDER THUS FAR-AGING VICE CHAIRMAN YE JIEN-YING, A NUMBER TWO MAN IN
CHINA--WILL BE CRITICAL.
20. POTENTIAL STUMBLING BLOCKS FOR DENG INCLUDE A NUMBER
CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL
PAGE 11

STATE 046435

OF KNOWN DOMESTIC POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC ISSUES. BUT FOR
THE FIRST TIME THERE IS SOME EVIDENCE THAT DENG'S
OPPONENTS MAY ALREADY HAVE LOOKED TO FOREIGN POLICY-SPECIFICALLY POLICY REGARDING VIETNAM--FOR A POLITICAL
WEAPON AGAINST HIM. A VERY SIGNIFICANT DECEMBER MEDIA
ARTICLE RESURRECTED DISCUSSION OF THE MOST IMPORTANT
STRATEGIC DEBATE IN NINETEENTH CENTURY CHINA. THE HERO,
WHO ARGUED THAT THE RUSSIAN THREAT FAR OUTWEIGHED ANY
THREAT FROM THE WESTERN POWERS, BEARS A STRIKING RESEMBLANCE TO DENG. THE HISTORICAL ANALOGY SUGGESTS DENG HAS
BEEN ACCUSED (AS IN 1975) OF OVERSTRESSING THE THREAT FROM
THE NORTH AND &quot;SELLING OUT&quot; CHINA'S INTERESTS TO THE WEST
IN ORDER TO GAIN PERSONAL POWER. RECENT REPORTS OF A
SHAKEUP IN THE FOREIGN MINISTRY MAY ALSO BE INDICATIVE
OF HIGHER LEVEL DISAGREEMENT OVER FOREIGN POLICY.
21. DENG VERY MUCH NEEDS CONTINUING PROOF OF THE WISDOM
OF HIS FOREIGN POLICY APPROACH. A SERIOUS DEFEAT IN
VIETNAM COULD BE USED TO UNDERMINE HIS POLITICAL CREDIBILITY. EVEN A VICTORY, THOUGH IT WOULD REDOUND TO HIS
CREDIT IN THE SHORT-TERM, MAY WELL MEAN A BIGGER MILITARY VOICE IN POLITICAL AND BUDGETARY DECISIONS. THIS

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
COULD DECREASE THE ALREADY SLIM CHANCES THAT HIS AMBITIOUS DEVELOPMENT GOALS WILL BE REACHED. CHINA'S ACTION
HAS ALREADY REDIRECTED SCARCE RESOURCES TO THE MILITARY,
WEAKENING THE BASE OF THE CIVILIAN MODERNIZATION PROGRAM,
AND THERE IS NO &quot;VICTORIOUS&quot; END IN SIGHT. IN MORE
SUBTLE WAYS, CHINA'S ACTION MAY HAVE CHANGED THE ATTITUDES
OF FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS AND INVESTORS TOWARD INVESTING
POLITICALLY OR ECONOMICALLY IN CHINA'S FUTURE.
22. THE CURRENT SITUATION MAY ESPECIALLY IMPACT ON
CHINESE ATTITUOWARD FUTURE RELATIONS WITH THE U.S.
SINCE THE EARLY 1970'S, THE MAJOR CHINESE JUSTIFICATION
FOR NORMALIZATION WITH THE U.S. HAS BEEN THE STRATEGIC

SECURITY IT COULD BRING CHINA IN THE FACE OF THE SOVIET
THREAT. DOUBTS EXIST ABOUT US INTENTIONS TO STAND UP TO
SOVIET EXPANSION OF INFLUENCE. THE DEGREE OF U.S. SUPPORT
FOR CHINA IN THE FACE OF SOVIET REACTION TO THE CURRENT
SITUATION IN INDOCHINA WILL BE A STRONG DETERMINING FACTOR
OF SUBSEQUENT SUPPORT IN THE CHINESE LEADERSHIP FOR
COOPERATION WITH THE U.S.
B. THE ECONOMY: AN IDEOLOGICAL FOUNDATION
23. THAT THE POST-MAO LEADERSHIP HAD ACHIEVED A CONSENSUS
BEHIND THE AGGRESSIVE MODERNIZATION POLICIES ADVOCATED BY
DENG XIAOPING AND HIS ASSOCIATES WAS SIGNALLED BY THE
OCTOBER 1 NATIONAL DAY EDITORIALS WHICH ANNOUNCED THAT
CHINA WOULD ACCELERATE THE PACE OF ITS MODERNIZATION. JUST
FIVE DAYS LATER ON OCTOBER 6 THE THEORETICAL GUIDELINES FOR
CHINA'S DEVELOPMENT WERE REVEALED IN A PEOPLE'S DAILY
ARTICLE ENTITLED &quot;ACT IN ACCORDANCE WITH ECONOMIC LAWS.&quot;
THE ARTICLE, WRITTEN BY HU QIAOMU, PRESIDENT OF THE CHINESE
ACADEMY OF SOCIAL SCIENCES, HAD ORIGINALLY BEEN PRESENTED
AS A SPEECH BY HU TO A MEETING OF THE STATE COUNCIL IN JULY
1978. THE LONG DELAY IN ITS PUBLICATION POINTS TO THE
LIKELIHOOD OF SERIOUS DIFFERENCES OVER ITS CONTENTS. HU
ARGUED THAT PRACTICAL ECONOMIC CONSIDERATIONS--OBJECTIVE
ECONOMIC LAWS--RATHER THAN THE DICTATES OF POLITICAL AUTHORITIES SHOULD GOVERN ECONOMIC DECISIONS.
24. THE PARTY PLENUM: AS REVEALED EARLY THIS YEAR, THE
THIRD PLENUM OF THE 11TH SESSION OF THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE
ENDORSED THE APPROACH ADVOCATED BY HU AND ADOPTED SOME OF
HIS SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS, INCLUDING HIS PROPOSAL TO
FURTHER DECENTRALIZE CONTROL OF ECONOMIC MANAGEMENT. THIS
SUBORDINATION OF POLITICS TO OBJECTIVE ECONOMIC MANAGEMENT

WILL HAVE A PROFOUND EFFECT ON THE NATURE OF PARTY CONTROL
OF ECONOMIC ENTERPRISES, AND CANNOT HELP BUT ERODE THE
AUTHORITY OF PARTY ADMINISTRATIVE CADRES AND IDEOLOGUES
VIS A VIS THE TECHNOCRATS AND SPECIALISTS.
25. THE PARTY PLENUM ADOPTED A NUMBER OF CONCRETE MEASURES
INCLUDING:
--RATIFICATION, WITH REVISIONS, OF THE 1979 AND 1980
NATIONAL ECONOMIC PLANS,
--RECOMMENDATION THAT CONTROL OF ECONOMIC ENTERPRISES BE
FURTHER DECENTRALIZED, AND LINES SEPARATING THE RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE PARTY, GOVERNMENT, AND ENTERPRISE BE
MORE SHARPLY DRAWN,
--SETTING STATE AGRICULTURAL TAX AND GRAIN PURCHASING
LEVELS,
RAISING THE PRICES THE STATE WILL PAY PEASANTS FOR THEIR
GRAIN BEGINNING WITH THE 1979 SUMMER HARVEST,
--LOWERING THE PRICES PEASANTS WILL PAY FOR AGRICULTURAL
MACHINERY AND PRODUCTS NEEDED TO INCREASE CROP YIELDS,
ORDERING THE TRIAL USE OF TWO DRAFT DOCUMENTS CONCERNING
AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION AND MANAGEMENT OF RURAL COMMUNES.
26. AGRICULTURAL POLICY. THE PROGRAM ENDORSED BY THE
PLENUM CONCENTRATED HEAVILY ON AGRICULTURAL POLICY (SEE
MEASURES NOTED ABOVE), ILLUSTRATING THE CRITICAL NATURE
OF THE RURAL SECTOR TO CHINA'S ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. SINCE
1949 CHINA HAS ACHIEVED SOME IMPRESSIVE RESULTS IN THIS
SECTOR, BUT IT HAS NOT BEEN ABLE TO BREAK OUT OF THE RANGE
OF SUBSISTENCE-LEVEL PRODUCTION. CHINA HAS BEEN A NET
IMPORTER OF GRAIN EVER SINCE THE EARLY 1960'S, AND PER
CAPITA PRODUCTION HAS ONLY REGAINED THE LEVELS OF THE EARLY

1950'S IN THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS.
27. BEIJING'S 10-YEAR PLAN PLACES HEAVY DEMANDS ON AGRICULTURE FOR BOTH FOODSTUFFS AND INDUSTRIAL RAW MATERIALS.
TO ACCELERATE OUTPUT GROUTH--OR, AT LEAST, TO GUARD AGAINST
THE POSSIBILITY OF POOR HARVESTS UNDERCUTTING THE 10-YEAR
PLAN, BEIJING IS STEPPING UP ITS INVESTMENT IN AGRICULTURE,
INCREASING INCENTIVES TO INDIVIDEASANTS AND TO PRO-

MAKING TO THESE PRODUCTION UNITS. NONETHELESS, CHINA'S
PROGRAM FOR ATTAINING THE GROWTH RATES TARGETED AT THE
FIFTH NATIONAL PEOPLE'S CONGRESS (85 PERCENT MECHANIZATION,
4 TO 5 PERCENT INCREASE PER YEAR IN GRAIN PRODUCTION) IS
EXTREMELY AMBITIOUS AND PROBABLY FEASIBLE ONLY UNDER THE
MOST AUSPICIOUS OF CIRCUMSTANCES.
28. INDUSTRIALIZATION: THE CHINESE LEADERSHIP IS ENGAGED
IN AN AMBITIOUS PROGRAM TO ACQUIRE WESTERN MACHINES AND
TECHNOLOGY TO MODERNIZE THE COUNTRY'S BACKWARD INDUSTRIAL
BASE. MAJOR PURCHASES OF PLANTS AND EQUIPMENT HAVE A
POTENTIAL FOREIGN EXCHANGE COST OF 40 BILLION DOLLARS
BETWEEN 1979 AND 1985. EMPHASIS IS ON PETROCHEMICALS AND
SYNTHETIC FIBERS, METALS, FUELS, TRANSPORTATION, AND
COMMUNICATIONS.
29. IDEOLOGICAL CONSTRAINTS WHICH PREVIOUSLY INHIBITED THE
ACQUISITION OF FOREIGN TECHNOLOGY ARE RAPIDLY ERODING, ALTHOUGH THE STILL EXISTING BOUNDARIES ARE UNCERTAIN. AMONG
THE MOST DRAMATIC SHIFTS IN POLICY ARE THE DECISION TO
SEND THOUSANDS OF CHINESE STUDENTS OVERSEAS, AND THE
DECISION TO CONSIDER A VARIETY OF SCHEMES INCLUDING JOINT
VENTURES, BARTER AND PRODUCT PAYBACK DEALS, LONG-TERM
CREDITS, AND EVEN GOVERNMENT-TO-GOVERNMENT LOANS TO FINANCE

THE COSTS OF MODERNIZATION. IN A MAJOR CONCESSION TO
WESTERN BUSINESSMEN BEIJING IS LAYING THE GROUNDWORK FOR
ADHERENCE TO THE PARIS CONVENTION ON INTERNATIONAL PATENT
PROTECTION.
30. FINANCE, HOWEVER, IS NOT LIKELY TO BE THE PRINCIPAL
CONSTRAINT TO INDUSTRIAL MODERNIZATION. WESTERN MONEY
MARKETS APPEAR TO BE WELL DISPOSED TO EXTEND CHINA THE
CREDITS IT WOULD REQUIRE TO FINANCE ITS CAPITAL IMPORT PROGRAM. THE MAJOR CONSTRAINT RATHER WOULD SEEM TO BE CHINA'S
ABILITY TO EFFECTIVELY ABSORB LARGE AMOUNTS OF CAPITAL AND
TECHNOLOGY. THE SHEER SIZE AND SPEED OF CHINA'S EFFORTS
ARND TO CREATE BOTTLENECKS WHICH WILL HINDER THE RAPID
COMPLETION OF MANY PROJECTS. THE COUNTRY HAS A SERIOUS
SHORTAGE OF SKILLED PLANNERS AND MANAGERS AND THE INTERRUPTIONS TO UNIVERSITY TRAINING FROM 1966-76 HAS LEFT CHINA
WITH A TEN YEAR GAP IN THE RANKS OF ITS SCIENTISTS AND
ENGINEERS.
31. ANY RELUCTANCE OF CADRE AND WORKERS TO FULLY EMBRACE
THE LEADERSHIP PROGRAM COULD ALSO BECOME A CRITICAL RESTRAINT.

32. THE 1978 PERFORMANCE. FIGURES RELEASED IN THE CHINESE
PRESS INDICATE THAT MOST SECTORS OF CHINA'S INDUSTRY
INCREASED PRODUCTION IN 1978, THOUGH SEVERE DROUGHT AFFECTED
AGRICULTURAL PERFORMANCE. THE STEEL INDUSTRY, AFTER YEARS
OF STAGNATION, MADE CONSIDERABLE ADVANCES; NEW CHINA NEWS
AGENCY (NCNA) REPORTED ON 10 DECEMBER TOTAL OUTPUT OF
AROUND 31 MILLION TONS--7 MILLION TONS MORE THAN IN 1977
AND 3 MILLION TONS ABOVE THE 1978 PLAN. COAL PRODUCTION
REACHED 600 MILLION TONS--50 MILLION TONS HIGHER THAN IN
1977 (NCNA 29 DECEMBER). INCREASES IN OTHER KEY SECTORS
DURING THE FIRST 11 MONTHS OF 1978 OVER THE SAME PERIOD
IN 1977 WERE:

INDUSTRIAL OUTPUT FOR JANUARY-NOVEMBER 1978 SHOWED A 12
PER CENT INCREASE OVER THE SAM PERIOD IN 1977, WHILE A 20
PER CENT INCREASE WAS RECORDED FOR TOTAL FOREIGN TRADE
TURNOVER (NCNA 25 AND 26 DECEMBER 1978).

HARVEST WOULD REACH 295 MILLION TONS--A 10 MILLION TON
INCREASE OVER 1977. IN VIEW OF THE DROUGHT THIS IS A
CREDITABLE FIGURE BUT FALLS SHORT OF THE ORIGINAL PRODUCTION TARGET. THE TARGET FOR 1985 IS 400 MILLION TONS, A
4-5 PER CENT ANNUAL INCREASE. THE 1978 FIGURE THUS FALLS
SHORT BY ABOUT 4 MILLION TONS. EIGHT PROVINCES, INCLUDING
THE MAJOR WHEAT AND RICE-GROWING PRODUCERS, RECORDED A

CAREFUL MANAGEMENT AND STUDY OF WEATHER CONDITIONS.
C. CHINESE FOREIGN POLICY
35. SUMMARY. THE CENTRAL THRUST OF CHINESE FOREIGN POLICY
CONTINUES TO BE A VIGOROUS EXPANSION OF FOREIGN TIES,
PARTICULARLY WITH JAPAN AND THE WEST, DESIGNED TO ENHANCE
CHINA'S SECURITY, PROSPERITY, AND PRESTIGE. NORMALIZATION
OF SINO-US RELATIONS, THE MAJOR EVENT OF THE PAST HALFYEAR IN CHINESE FOREIGN POLICY, IS A CAPSTONE OF CHINESE
EFFORTS.
36. WITH NORMALIZATION AND THE SIGNING OF THE SINO-JAPANESE PEACE AND FRIENDSHIP TREATY IN OCTOBER, THE FOUNDATIONS
OF CHINA'S CURRENT POLICY ARE IN PLACE. BEIJING WILL NOW
CONCENTRATE ITS EFFORTS ON MAKING ITS NEW ALIGNMENTS WORK
IN ITS INTERESTS. SPECIFICALLY, IT WILL LOOK FOR CONCRETE
RESULTS FROM ITS CALL FOR UNITED ACTION BY CHINA, JAPAN,
THE US AND EUROPE AGAINST THE DANGER OF SOVIER HEGEMONISM.
IT WILL ENERGETICALLY PURSUE ADVANTAGEOUS DEALS BY WHICH
FOREIGN EXPERTISE, EQUIPMENT, AND CAPITAL CAN ASSIST IN
CHINA'S DRIVE TO REALIZE THE &quot;FOUR MODERNIZATIONS&quot;, AND
FOREIGN WEAPON CAN STRENGTHEN CHINA'S SECURITY.
37. WHILE CHINA'S RECENT FOREIGN POLICY RECORD HAS BEEN
DRAMATIC AND HAS INCLUDED MANY SUCCESSES, SERIOUS PROBLEMS
REMAIN. THE MOST IMPORTANT FAILURE HAS BEEN BEIJING'S
INABILITY TO PREVENT THE EXPANSION OF SOVIET-BACKED
VIETNAMESE INFLUENCE INMPUCHEA, DESPITE ITS INVASION
OF VIETNAM AND SIGNIFICANT AID TO PHNOM PENH. CHINA ALSO
VIEWS WITH PARTICULAR ANXIETY SOVIET GAINS IN AFGHANISTAN,
INCREASED SOVIET NAVAL AND AIR POWER IN THE WESTERN
PACIFIC, AND INSTABILITY IN PAKISTAN AND IRAN. FURTHERMORE, WHILE CHINESE COMMUNIST THINKING CONTAINS AMPLE
JUSTIFICATION FOR &quot;UNITED FRONTS&quot; WITH IDEOLOGICAL OPPOCONFIDENTIAL

NENTS TO DEFEAT A COMMON ADVERSARY, IT IS VERY LIKELY THAT
MANY IN CHINA HAVE RESERVATIONS ABOUT THE CURRENT ENTHUSIASM FOR TIES WITH THE WEST. CRITICISM OF THE PRESENT
COURSE COULD SURFACE IF ENHANCEMENT OF CHINA'S SECURITY,
PROSPERITY, AND PRESTIGE IS NOT EVIDENT WITH THE NEXT
FEW YEARS.
38. SINO-US RELATIONS. NORMALIZATION AND VICE-PREMIER

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
DENG XIAOPING'S VISIT TO THE US HAVE PRODUCED RESULTS
HIGHLY SATISFACTORY TO BEIJING. THE AGREEMENTS SIGNED
DURING DENG'S TRIP AND THE EXPECTED REMOVAL OF REMAINING
OBSTACLES TO TRADE WILL PROVIDE CHINA WITH MUCH INCREASED
ACCESS TO AMERICAN TECHNOLOGY, INDUSTRIAL AND AGRICULTURAL
PRODUCTS, AND MARKETS. THE TAIWAN ISSUE HAS BEEN REMOVED
AS THE PRIMARY STICKING POINT TO IMPROVED SINO-US TIES.
AND FINALLY, BEIJING PROBABLY BELIEVES THAT IT HAS ACHIEVED
AT LAST THE APPEARANCE OF HAVING A POWERFUL FRIEND IN ITS
OPPOSITION TO MOSCOW.
39. AT THE SAME TIME, CHINESE LEADERS RECOGNIZE THAT
US WEAPONS SALES TO TAIWAN UILL CONTINUE TO BE A BONE OF
CONTENTION. MOREOVER, DESPITE CHINESE ATTEMPTS TO WARN
WASHINGTON OF THE DANGERS OF DETENTE, THERE REMAINS A
FUNDAMENTAL DIVERGENCE OF VIEWS ON THIS KEY ISSUE. AND
ALTHOUGH SOMEWHAT IN THE SHADOWS NOW, CHINA DOES HAVE
IMPORTANT CONSTITUENCIES IN THE THIRD WORLD AND AMONG
SOCIALIST COUNTRIES WHICH WILL CONSTRAIN ITS FRIENDSHIP
WITH THE LEADER OF THE WESTERN WORLD.
40. SINO-SOVIET RELATIONS. THERE HAS BEEN NO MOVEMENT IN
SINO-SOVIET BILATERAL RELATIONS IN THE PAST HALF-YEAR.
BONTINUE TO REGARD THE OTHER AS THEIR PRIME ADVERSARY,
AND THE DEGREE OF MUTUAL SUSPICION IS SUCH THAT IT IS
CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL
PAGE 19

STATE 046435

HARD TO IMAGINE ANY THAW IN THE PRESENT DEEP-FROZEN RELATIONS. EVEN THE LINK OF THE 1950 SINO-SOVIET TREATY WILL
PROBABLY BE DENOUNCED BY CHINA IN APRIL. ROUTINE BORDER
RIVER NAVIGATION TALKS ARE SCHEDULED TO BEGIN IN MARCH,
BUT THEY WILL NOT TOUCH ON THE CRUCIAL ISSUE OF BORDER
DEMARCATION. TRADE REMAINS A MODEST LEVEL. BEYOND THIS,
STATE-TO-STATE RELATIONS CONTINUE IN AN ATMOSPHERE OF COLD
PROPRIETY; PARTY-TO-PARTY RELATIONS DO NOT EXIST.
41. AS IN BILATERAL RELATIONS, BOTH MOSCOW AND BEIJING SEE
THE OTHER'S WORLD-WIDE POLICIES ROOTED IN PURE SELFAGGRANDIZEMENT, LEAVING LITTLE POSSIBILITY FOR IMPROVED
RELATIONS.
42. SINO-JAPANESE RELATIONS. RELATIONS BETWEEN CHINA AND
JAPAN ARE GOOD, WITH ECONOMIC TIES PROVIDING THE KEY LINK
BETWEEN ASIA'S MOST POPULOUS AND WEALTHIEST COUNTRIES.
WITHIN THE CONTEXT OF THEIR LONG-TERM TRADE AGREEMENT, DUE
TO RUN UNTIL 1990, CHINA HOPES TO PURCHASE TECHNOLOGY AND
INDUSTRIAL PLANTS WITH EXPORTS OF OIL, COAL, AND OTHER RAW
MATERIALS.
A POSSIBLE IMPEDIMENT
MAY WELL BE CHINA'S

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
DIFFICULTY IN FINANCING ITS EXTENSIVE IMPORT WISH-LIST.
43. CHINA VIEWS JAPAN AS AN IMPORTANT ELEMENT IN THE
STRATEGIC ENVIRONMENT IN ASIA. BEIJING, THEREFORE, ENCOURAGES CLOSE US-JAPANESE SECURITY TIES AS A MEANS OF
RETAINING A US PRESENCE IN ASIA. IT HOPES THAT JAPAN WILL
TAKE A HARD LINE IN ITS BILATERAL RELATIONS WITH MOSCOW,
AS WELL AS ACT AS A BRAKE ON SOVIET AMBITIONS IN SOUTHEAST ASIA BY DISTANCING ITSELF FROM VIETNAM AND SOLIDIFYING
TIES WITH ASEAN.
44. CHINA AND EUROPE. CHINA CONTINUES TO VIEW EUROPE AS
THE FOCUS OF CONFRONTATION BETWEEN THE US AND USSR, EVEN
CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL
PAGE 20

STATE 046435

THOUGH RECENTLY MOSCOW HAS CONCENTRATEDEFFORTS ON
&quot;OUTFLANKING&quot; EUROPE IN THE PERSIAN GULF AND RED SEA AREAS.
BEIJING STRONGLY SUPPORTS NATO AND THE EC AS INDICATIONS
OF EUROPEAN UNITY AND CONTINUES TO STRENGTHEN ITS OWN
BILATERAL RELATIONS WITH ALL COUNTRIES THERE. THE RECENT
ESTABLISHMENT OF DIPLOMATIC TIES WITH PORTUGAL AND CONCLUSION OF A LONG-TERM TRADE PACT WITH FRANCE ARE CONSPICUOUS EXAMPLES. CHINA IS ALSO COUNTING ON EUROPE AS
AN IMPORTANT SUPPLIER OF CAPITAL TECHNOLOGY, AND INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTS. MOREOVER, BEIJING WANTS TO BUY MILITARY
WEAPONS AND TECHNOLOGY FROM EUROPE, SINCE NEITHER THE
US NOR JAPAN WILL SELL THESE ITEMS.
45. PRC-TAIWAN RELATIONS. WITH US RECOGNITION, BEIJING
HAS ESSENTIALLY WON ITS LONG COMPETITION WITH TAIPEI FOR
INTERNATIONAL ACCEPTANCE AS THE LEGITIMATE GOVERNMENT OF
CHINA. THE PRC, HOPING TO UTILIZE THE SHOCK OF US
DERECOGNITION, IS NOW STEPPING UP ITS EFFORTS TO COAX
TAIWAN TOWARD REUNIFICATION, OR AT LEAST TO STABILIZE THE
SITUATION AND PREVENT ANY MOVEMENT TOWARD INDEFINITE SEPARATION. THE PRC HAS OFFERED TO TALK WITH CHIANG CHING-KUO,
CALLED FOR COMMERCIAL, TRANSPORTATION, AND POSTAL LINKS WITH
TAIWN, AND CEASED SHELLING THE OFFSHORE ISLANDS AS GESTURES
OF GOOD FAITH. THE MOST DRAMATIC ENTICEMENT WAS VICEPREMIER DENG'S STATEMENT TO AMERICAN AND JAPANESE VISITORS
THAT AFTER REUNIFICATION TAIWAN AUTHORITIES COULD ENJOY
FULL AUTONOMY, INCLUDING THE RETENTION OF SECURITY FORCES
AND FULL ADMINISTRATIVE POWER. THIS STARTLING CONCESSION
SEEMS TO INDICATE THAT FOR BEIJING &quot;REUNIFICATION&quot; IS
PRIMARILY A MATTER OF TAIPEI'S RECOGNITION OF THE PRC'S
SOVERNEIGNTY, WITH THE QUESTION OF ADMINISTRATIVE REINTEGRATION WITH THE MAINLAND TO BE POSTPONED, LIKE THAT OF

HONG KONG AND MACAO, UNTIL AN UNSPECIFIED &quot;APPROPRIATE
TIME.&quot;
46. BEIJING'S SERIOUS CONCERN OVER THE POSSIBILITY OF A
VIGOROUS INDEPENDENCE MOVEMENT ON TAIWS BEEN INDICATED
BY ITS SPECIFIC CONDEMNATION OF SUCH A COURSE AND ITS
EXPLICIT DESIRE TO BEGIN CONTACTS SOON AND WITH CHIANG
CHING-KUO, FOR AT LEAST HE SHARES WITH THEM THE SUPREME
LOYALTY TO ONE CHINA. BEIJING REFUSES TO RULE OUT THE
POSSIBILITY THAT FORCE MAY BE USED AGAINST TAIWAN IF ITS
ENTICEMENTS ARE REFUSED INDEFINITELY. FINALLY, ITS HAS
REPEATED PRIOR WARNINGS ABOUT THE UNACCEPTABILITY OF LINKS
BETWEEN TAIWAN AND THE USSR.
47. CHIANG CHING-KUO AND HIS GOVERNMENT, ALTHOUGH CLEARLY
SHAKEN BY US DERECOGNITION, HAVE RESPONDED TO PRC
BY FIRMLY REITERATING THEIR STANDARD POSITION--RHETORICALLY,
RETAKING OF THE MAINLAND REMAINS THE PRIMARY NATIONAL GOAL
AND UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES WILL THEY NEGOTIATE WITH THE
PRC. TAIWAN HAS ALSO REAFFIRMED ITS DECISION NOT TO DEVELOP N;CLEAR WEAPONS NOR SEEK RELATIONS WITH MOSCOW.
PRESIDENT CHIANG HAS ESTABLISHED A HIGH-RANKING COMMITTEE
TO MONITOR THE BEIJING CAMPAIGN AND DEVELOP NEW PROPAGANDA
MEANS TO DEAL WITH IT.
48. A MORE PRESSING ISSUE FOR TAIPEI IN THE WAKE OF
NORMALIZATION HAS BEEN THE CONCERN THAT OPPOSITION FORCES
WILL NOW PUSH HARDER FOR A LARGER POLITICAL VOICE TO
DISCUSS THE FUTURE OF TAIWAN. SO FAR THE KMT HAS MAINTAINED STABILITY BY NARROWING THE LIMITS OF PERMISSIBLE
DISSENT AND ATTEMPTING THROUGH SIGNIFICANT PERSONNEL
CHANGES TO ENHANCE THE PARTY'S APPEAL.

PRIMARY FOCUS OF CHINESE ATTENTION IN THE MIDDLE EAST
DURING THE PAST FEW MONTHS. CHINA SEES THE SHAH'S DOWNCONFIDENTIAL

THAT SOVIET INFLUENCE WILL REPLACE THAT OF THE US AND
EXPAND FROM IRAN TO THE ARABIAN PENINSULA. PEKING HAS
RECOGNIZED THE KHOMEINI GOVERNMENT, BUT FEELS IT HAS NO
LEVERAGE IN IRAN. CHINESE SPOKESMEN HAVE COMPARED THE
IRANIAN SITUATION TO THAT IN INDOCHINA AND EXPRESSED THE
HOPE THAT S WOULD ADOPT A MORE FORTHRIGHTLY ANTISOVIET POLICY IN THE MIDDLE EAST. PEKING'S TIES WITH

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
IRAQ ARE ON ONE OF THEIR PERIODIC UPSWINGS AND PEKING CAN
BE EXPECTED TO USE THAT LEVERAGE TO DISSUADE IRAQ FROM
ANY THOUGHTS OF ADVENTURISM IN IRAN OR THE GULF.
50. PEKING SHARES WITH SAUDI ARABIA THE APPREHENSION
THAT MOSCOW WILL OBTAIN A NAVAL BASE IN ADEN. CHINESE
EFFORTS TO PERSUADE SAUDI ARABIA TO ESTABLISH DIPLOMATIC
RELATIONS HAVE NOT FOUND A FAVORABLE RESPONSE, DESPITE AN
INCREASE IN SINO-SAUDI TRADE. HOWEVER, CHINA CONTINUES
CORDIAL DIPLOMATIC AND TRADE TIES WITH MOST ARAB STATES.
51. PEKING HAS EXPRESSED ITS SUPPORT FOR THE SADAT
PEACE INITIATIVE AND HAS DETERMINED THAT THE CAMP DAVID
ACCORDS ARE A POSITIVE DEVELOPMENT BECAUSE THEY WERE
REACHED WITHOUT SOVIET INVOLVEMENT. CHINESE SUPPORT FOR
EGYPT HAS CONTRIBUTED TO A COOLING OF RELATIONS WITH THE
PALESTINIANS. THE PALESTINIANS PRESENT CHINA WITH A
DILEMMA, HOWEVER. OUT OF A SENSE OF JUSTICE AND IN ORDER
TO GUARD ITS REVOLUTIONARY IMAGE CHINA SUPPORTS THE
PALESTINE REVOLUTION WHILE AT THE SAME TIME SEEKING PEACE
AND STABILITY IN THE AREA TO THWART SOVIET OPPORTUNITY,
BASED ON ITS ASSESSMENT THAT THE PALESTINIAN ORGANIZATIONS ARE DISUNITED AND UNRELIABLE. THE VISIT OF A
SPECIAL PLO ENVOY TO PEKING IN LATE OCTOBER APPARENTLY
WAS INTENDED TO PRESSURE THE CHINESE INTO MAKING CLEAR
CONFIDENTIAL

PAGE 23

STATE 046435

HOW THEY COULD SUPPORT SADAT'S INITIATIVE AND THE
PALESTINIAN CAUSE AT ONCE. THE CHINESE SIDESTEPPED THE
ISSUE. HOWEVER, IN PUBLIC PRONOUNCEMENTS PEKING CONTINUES TO SAY IT WILL HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH &quot;THE
ZIONIST STATE.&quot;
52. SOUTH ASIA. THE VISIT OF VICE PREMIER LI XIANNIAN
TO PAKISTAN IN JANUARY AGAIN UNDERLINED CHINESE CONCERN
THAT THE SITUATION IN IRAN WOULD COMBINE WITH INSTABILITY IN AFGHANISTAN AND PAKISTAN TO ENHANCE SOVIET
OPPORTUNITIES. THE VISIT WAS INTENDED TOSURE
PAKISTAN OF CHINESE SUPPORT. CHINA HAS ENCOURAGED
PAKISTAN TO REMAIN IN CENTO AND CAN NOW BE EXPECTED TO
COORDINATE POLICY EVEN MORE CLOSELY WITH ISLAMABAD.
53. DURING INDIAN FOREIGN MINISTER VAJPAYEE'S MIDFEBRUARY VISIT TO PEKING THE CHINESE MADE CLEAR THEIR
EAGERNESS TO IMPROVE RELATIONS WITH NEW DELHI. VICE
PREMIER DENG TOLD VAJPAYEE THAT THE BOUNDARY QUESTION
COULD BE RESOLVED THROUGH PEACEFUL NEGOTIATIONS AND,
&quot;WE SHOULD NOW LOSE NO TIME IN IMPROVING RELATIONS BETWEEN OUR TWO COUNTRIES.&quot; THE CHINESE STATEMENTS TO

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
VAJPAYEE CONVEYED A SENSE OF URGENCY REFLECTING PEKING'S
EAGERNESS, PARTICULARLY IN VIEW OF THE DETERIORATION OF
SINO-VIETNAMESE RELATIONS, TO WEAN INDIA FROM MOSCOW'S
INFLUENCE. VAJPAYEE'S ABRUPT DEPARTURE AND SUBSEQUENT
INDIAN CONDEMNATION OF THE CHINESE INCURSION INTO VIETNAM
REFLECT NEW DELHI'S CHAGRIN OVER THE TIMING OF THE INVASION AND MISTRUST OF CHINESE INTENTIONS. IT WILL BE
DIFFICULT FOR PEKING TO RECOUP THE DAMAGES.
54. AFRICA. DURING 1978 CHINA INITIATED A SERIES OF
HIGH LEVEL EXCHANGES WITH AFRICAN COUNTRIES IN AN EFFORT

CONGO, RWANDA, THE SEYCHELLES, CHAD AND GABON VISITED
CHINA IN 1978 AND SEVERAL HIGH RANKING CHINESE DELEGATIONS
VISITED AFRICA IN TURN.
55. THE VISIT OF VICE PREMIER LI XIANNIAN IN JANUARY WAS
THE FIRST BY A CHINESE OFFICIAL OF HIS RANK SINCE PREMIER CHOU EN-LAI'S VISIT IN 1965. THE LI TRIP TO TANZANIA, MOZAMBIQUE, ZAMBIA AND ZAIRE WAS INTENDED TO REASSURE THESE STATES OF CHINA'S GOODWILL AND CONTINUE THE
IMAGE OF CHINA AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO RELIANCE ON THE SOVIET
UNION. IT ALSO APPARENTLY SERVED TO SMOOTH OVER SOME
RECENT DIFFERENCES WITH TANZANIA AND MOZAMBIQUE.
56. UNABLE TO TE WITH THE SOVIET UNION EITHER IN
PROVISION OF MILITARY OR ECONOMIC AID, CHINA FINDS ITSELF
ON THE WHOLE FORCED TO REACT TO SOVIET ACTIONS. CHINA
CONTINUES TO ADVOCATE POLITICAL SOLUTIONS IN AFRICA TO
PREVENT AFRICANS TURNING TO THE SOVIETS FOR MILITARY AID.
CUBA AS A &quot;CATS PAW&quot; FOR SOVIET INTENTIONS COMES UNDER
FREQUENT ATTACK IN THE CHINESE MEDIA.
57. ALTHOUGH CHINESE AID TO AFRICAN STATES HAS DECLINED
IN THE PAST FEW YEARS DUE TO CHINA'S MODERNIZATION DRIVE
AT HOME, PEKING CONTINUES LIMITED AMOUNTS OF AID TO
SEVERAL COUNTRIES AND HAS A GOOD REPUTATION IN AFRICA FOR
&quot;NO STRINGS ATTACHED&quot; ASSISTANCE. MILITARY AID HAS
PRIMARILY BEEN SMALL ARMS AMMUNITION, COMBINED WITH A
SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF TRAINING BY CHINESE ADVISORS,

59. IN JANUARY BEIJING ANNOUNCED THE ESTABLISHMENT OF
DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS WITH DJIBOUTI, A STATE CHINA CONSIDERS STRATEGICALLY PLACED TO HELP BLOCK SOVIET DESIGNS
IN AFRICA'S HORN AND THE ARABIAN PENINSULA. CHINA HAS
ALSO BEGUN PRELIMINARY TALKS TOWARD NORMALIZATION OF
RELATIONS WITH ANGOLA. HOWEVER, WHILE PEKING'S RELATIONS
WITH AFRICAN STATES ARE MAINLY CORDIAL CHINA'S ABILITY
TO AFFECT EVENTS IN AFRICA WILL LIKELY BE MINIMAL UNTIL
CHINA'S ECONOMY IS SUFFICIENTLY MODERNIZED TO ALLOW
PEKING TO COMPETE WITH SOVIET AND WESTERN INTERESTS.
59. LATIN AMERICA. ALTHOUGH LATIN AMERICA HAS TRADITIONALLY BEEN OF LITTLE CONCERN TO CHINA, IN RECENT
MONTHS PEKING HAS SHOWN AN INCREASED AWARENESS OF THE
AREA. DURING A STATE VISIT TO CHINA IN OCTOBER, MEXICN
DENT PORTILLO EXPRESSED WILLINGNESS TO HELP CHINA
EXPAND ITS TIES WITH OTHER LATIN AMERICAN STATES.
60. A VISIT TO CHINA BY CHILEAN FOREIGN MINISTER
CUBILLOS IN OCTOBER FURTHER DEMONSTRATED CHINA'S
AWAKENING INTEREST IN LATIN AMERICA. XINHUA STRESSED
THAT CUBILLOS' TALKS WITH CHINESE LEADERS SHOWED A
SIMILARITY OF INTEREST ON MAJOR INTERNATIONAL ISSUES
BECAUSE BOTH COUNTRIES BELONG TO THE THIRD WORLD. DESPITE RECENT TRADE AGREEMENTS WITH CHILE, BRAZIL, AND
PERU, CHINA'S COMMERCIAL RELATIONS WITH LATIN AMERICA
REMAIN LIMITED.

CHINESE INVASION OF VIETNAM.
63. THE LOSS OF KAMPUCHEA HAS BEEN A SEVERE EMBARRASSMENT TO THE CHINESE AND PEKING CONTINUES ITS SUPPORT
FOR THE KAMPUCHEAN RESISTANCE MOVEMENT. IN JANUARY CHINA
SPONSORED NORODOM SIHANOUK'S APPEARANCE BEFORE THE UN
SECURITY COUNCIL AND FELT IT HAD GAINED A DIPLOMATIC
TRIUMPH WHEN THE COUNCIL IN EFFECT VINDICATED CHINA'S
POSITION BY CALLING FOR WITHDRAWAL OF ALL FOREIGN FORCES
FROM KAMPUCHEA.
64. RELATIONS BETWEEN THAILAND AND CHINA HAVE APPARENTLY
BEEN STRENGTHENED BY THAI APPREHENSION OVER VIETNAM'S
MOTIVES IN KAMPUCHEA. THAILAND, HOWEVER, HAS PUBLICLY
DENIED THAT IT WILL FACILITATE CHINESE RESUPPLY TO THE
DEMOCRATIC KAMPUCHEAN RESISTANCE. CHINA HAS BEEN ENCOURAGED BY THE ASEN STATES' UNANIMOUS CONDEMNATION OF
VIETNACTIONS IN KAMPUCHEA. IT HAS NOT, HOWEVER,
BEEN ABLE TO PERSUADE EITHER JAKARTA OR SINGAPORE TO
ESTABLISH DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS. THE CHINESE INVASION OF
VIETNAM WILL LIKELY RETARD EVEN FURTHER THE PROSPECTS FOR
SUCH NORMALIZATION.

SOVIET UNION WHEN IN MID-JANUARY IT PUBLICLY BRANDED
VIETNAM'S &quot;MASSIVE MILITARY ACTION&quot; AGAINST KAMPUCHEA
A &quot;CRUDE VIOLATION&quot; OF INTERNATIONAL LAW AND SAID VIETNAM
WAS FOLLOWING A &quot;DOMINATIONIST COURSE.&quot; BEIJING, HOWEVER, IS RELUCTANT TO APPLY OVERT PRESSURE ON PYONGYANG
TO MODERATE SOME OF ITS MORE EXTREME POLICIES FOR FEAR OF
DRIVING THE NORTH KOREANS BACK TO A MORE PRO-SOVIET
STANCE. IN LATE JANUARY PEOPLE'S DAILY SUPPORTED

TO MOST OBSERVERS, BUT DOES NOT SIGNAL ANY DRAMATIC SHIFTS
IN JAPAN'S POLICY ORIENTATION. OHIRA IS ONE OF JAPAN'S
MOST EXPERIENCED POLITICIANS, HAVING SERVED AS FINANCE

AND FOREIGN MINISTERS AND, MORE RECENTLY, AS A POWERFUL
AND EFFECTIVE SECRETARY GENERAL OF THE PARTY. HE IS
ONE OF THE LONG LINE OF BUREAUCRATS-TURNED-POLITICIAN WHO
HAVE EFFECTIVELY GOVERNED JAPAN SINCE THE END OF WORLD
WAR II. HIS ELECTION AT SOME POINT IN TIME HAS BEEN A
FOREGONE CONCLUSION FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS. HIS EXPERIENCE
AND STRONG SUPPORT WITHIN THE RULING PARTY SHOULD ASSURE
AN ADMINISTRATION OF CONSIDERABLE LONGEVITY. HE HAS
PROVEN HIMSELF ADEPT IN RELATIONS WITH JAPAN'S MODERATE
OPPOSITION. ALTHOUGH MORE COMFORTABLE WITH DOMESTIC
ISSUES, HE WILL DEAL COMPETENTLY WITH FOREFFAIRS
PROBLEMS, BUT WE EXPECT HIM TO ESCHEW THE DRAMATIC
APPROACH TO FOREIGN AFFAIRS OF HIS PREDECESSORS.

67. ALTHOUGH WITH THE CONCLUSION OF THE PEACE AND
FRIENDSHIP TREATY WITH CHINA AND OF THE CONTINENTAL SHELF
AGREEMENT WITH THE REPUBLIC OF KOREA, TWO LONG-PENDING
ITEMS OF JAPAN'S FOREIGN AFFAIRS AGENDA HAVE BEEN COMPLETED, OHIRA HAS INHERITED A NUMBER OF THORNY INTERNATIONAL AS WELL AS DOMESTIC PROBLEMS AND HIS RESPONSE WILL
HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE PARTY'S FATE IN LOCAL
ELECTIONS SCHEDULED FOR APRIL, 1979. THE CONSERVATIVES
STAND A GOOD CHANCE OF MAKING SIGNIFICANT GAINS, AT
PRESENT, BUT THE STATE OF THE ECONOMY AND OF JAPAN'S
RELATIONS WITH ITS KEY TRADING PARTNERS COULD AFFECT THE
OUTCOME.
B. FOREIGN AFFAIRS, TRADE PROBLEMS
68. DESPITE SOME PROGRESS IN THE MULTILATERAL TRADE
NEGOTIATIONS, CONTINUED IMPORT LIBERALIZATION, AND A
DRAMATIC APPRECIATION OF THE YEN, TOKYO'S ALREADY LARGE
TRADE SURPLUS NEARLY DOUBLED TO 18.3 BILLION DOLLARS IN
1978. THE 1978 TRADE SURPLUS OF 10.5 BILLION DOLLARS
WITH THE US SHOWS SIGNS OF BECOMING A MAJOR POLITICAL
PROBLEM IN THE US. JAPAN'S LACK OF SUCCESS IN DEALING
WITH THIS SURPLUS HAS CREATED CO'SIDERABLE TENSIONS WITH
ITS PRINCIPAL TRADING PARTNERS.
OHIRA'S WILLINGNESS TO GIVE UP HIS PREDECESSOR'S SEVEN
PER CENT GROWTH TARGET HAS CONTRIBUTED TO THESE TENSIONS,
AS HAS JAPAN'S RELUCTANCE TO DISMANTLE ITS COMPLEX IMPORT
BARRIERS.

LOW-KEY INVOLVEMENT WITHOUT EXCEPTIONAL INITIATIVES.
JAPAN HAS AN IMPORTANT GROWING STAKE IN CHINA'S MODERNIZATION EFFORT, HOWEVER, AND WILL STRIVE TO ASSURE ITS
SHARE OF THE EXPANDING CHINESE MARKET. THERE IS SOME
SPECULATION THAT CHINA WILL BECOME JAPSECOND LARGEST
MARKET, ALTHOUGH PROBLEMS OF FINANCING CHINESE IMPORTS
MAY SERVE TO RESTRAIN A RAPID EXPANSION OF TRADE.
70. JAPAN'S RELATIONS WITH THE REPUBLIC OF KOREA ARE
SATISFACTORY. TRADE CONTINUES UNABATED AND JAPANESE
INVESTMENT IN KOREA IS AT A HIGH LEVEL. RELATIONS WITH
NORTH KOREA REMAIN AT A VERY LOW LEVEL, BUT JAPAN HAS A
STRONG INTEREST IN THE PRESERVATION OF STABILITY ON THE
PENINSULA AND HAS ENCOURAGED THE VERY TENTATIVE RESUMPTION
OF NORTH-SOUTH TALKS.
71. JAPAN'S WARMING RELATIONS WITH CHINA, SOVIET MILITARY
ACTIVITIES IN THE JAPAN-CLAIMED NORTHERN TERRITORIES, AND
CONTINUING SOVIET HIGHHANDEDNESS IN DEALING WITH JAPAN
HAVE SERVED FURTHER TO CHILL JAPAN SOVIET RELATIONS.
MOSCOW HAS EVEN CHARGED JAPAN WITH JOINING AN ANTISOVIET ALLIANCE WITH THE US AND CHINA. WHILE RELATIONS
REMAIN CORRECT, THERE APPEARS LITTLE THE JAPANESE CAN
DO TO RESTORE MORE BALANCE IN ITS RELATIONS WITH THE
SOVIETS. PROSPECTS FOR MAJOR PARTICIPATION IN SIBERIAN
DEVELOPMENT, SO PROMISING A FEW YEARS AGO, ARE DIM AND,
IN ANY CASE, THE SOVIETS HAVE GIVEN LITTLE ENCOURAGEMENT.
72. RELATIONS WITH THE ASEAN COUNTRIES ARE GOOD, WITH
PROSPECTS FOR INCREASED JAPANESE DEVELOPMENT ASSISTANCE.
JAPAN IS, HOWEVER, VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE FIGHTING IN
KAMPUCHEA AND ON THE SINO-VIETNAM BORDER. ALTHOUGH IT
HAS REFUSED TO CONDEMN VIETNAMESE AGGRESSION, IT HAS
SUSPENDED ITS AID COMMITMENT AND CALLED ON ALL PARTIES TO
WITHDRAW. WE EXPECT JAPAN TO PLAY A CONSTRUCTIVE, LOWPROFILE ROLE IN INTERNATIONAL EFFORTS TO RESTORE STABILITY

TO THE REGION.
73. SINCE THE 1973-74 OIL CRISIS JAPAN HAS BEEN INCREASINGLY ATTENTIVE TO ITS RELATIONS WITH THE MIDDLE EAST.
ADDITIONAL AID, INCREASED ASSISTANCE FOR PETRO-CHEMICAL
PROJECTS AND MORE HIGH LEVEL VISITS HAVE SERVED TO IMPROVE
JAPAN'S POSITION. IT IS VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE SITUAT-

ION IN, FROM WHICH IT OBTAINED SOME 17 PER CENT OF
ITS PETROLEUM, BUT IS TENTATIVELY CONFIDENT THAT ITS LONG
RANGE POSITION WILL SURVIVE. A PROTRACTED CUT-OFF OF
IRANIAN CRUDE COULD, OF COURSE AFFECT JAPAN'S ECONOMIC
PERFORMANCE.
C. NATIONAL SECURITY
74. ALTHOUGH THE JAPANESE WERE INITIALLY CONCERNED ABOUT
THE US DECISION TO WITHDRAW GROUND FORCES FROM THE REPUBLIC OF KOREA, SUBSEQUENT US ACTIONS HAVE BEEN REASSURING.
THE SLOWLY INCREASING SOVIET NAVAL PRESENCE IN THE
PACIFIC, SOVIET DEPLOYMENTS TO THE NORTHERN TERRITORIES,
AND THE FIGHTING IN SOUTHEAST ASIA, HOWEVER, ARE MAJOR
CONCERNS. PARTIALLY AS A RESULT OF THESE CONCERNS, THERE
HAS BEEN UNPRECEDENTED OPENNESS IN THE DISCUSSION OF
DEFENSE ISSUES IN THE PAST YEAR, WHICH THE WESTERN PRESS
HAS TENDED TO EXAGGERATE. IN OUR OPINION, HOWEVER, THIS
IMPROVED CLIMATE FOR DEBATE HAS RESULTED IN A MORE RATIONAL APPROACH TO THE PROBLEM AND IN A REAFFIRMATION OF THE
SECURITY RELATIONSHIP WITH THE UNITED STATES.
75. THAT RELATIONSHIP IS IN GOOD SHAPE. WE ARE CONSULTING EVEN MORE CLOSELY WITH JAPAN. WE HAVE ESTABLISHED
A NEW DEFENSE PLANNING MECHANISM UNDER THE BILATERAL SUBCONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL
PAGE 31

STATE 046435

COMMITTEE FOR DEFENSE COOPERATION. THE JAPANESE HAVE
MOVED TO INCREASE THEIR FINANCIAL CONTRIBUTION TO THE
MAINTENANCE OF US FORCES IN JAPAN--SOME 650 MILLION
DOLLARS IN JFY 1979. PUBLIC OPINION IS SIGNIFICANTLY
MORE SUPPORTIVE THAN IN THE PAST OF JAPAN'S PRESENT
LEVEL OF DEFENSE EFFORT AND OF THE MUTUAL SECURITY TREATY
WITH THE US. JAPAN'S 10.5 BILLION DOLLARS JFY-1979
DEFENSE BUDGET PROVIDES FOR CONTINUING QUALITATIVE IMPROVEMENTS IN THE SELF DEFENSE FORCES AND WILL SIGNIFICANTLY
UPGRADE ITS AIR DEFENSE AND ASW CAPABILITY.
76. THESE DEVELOPMENTS ARE COMPATIBLE WITH US INTERESTS.
DESPITE SOME INTERPRETATIONS TO THE CONTRARY, THERE ARE
NO SIGNS THAT JAPAN'S DEFENSE BUDGET WILL CROSS THE
POAL BARRIER OF ONE PER CENT OF THE GNP IN THE NEXT
FEW YEARS. JAPAN'S LEADERSHIP IS SATISFIED WITH THE
PRESENT SECURITY ARRANGEMENTS, AND IS NOT LOOKING TOWARD
ACQUIRING A MILITARY CAPABILITY GREATER THAN AT PRESENT.
MORE FUNDAMENTALLY, THE DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL CONSTRAINTS AND POPULAR FEAR OF MILITARISM REMAIN
STRONG.
III. KOREAN PENINSULA

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014

A. NORTH KOREA
77. KIM IL-SONG, 65, WHO IS IN GOOD HEALTH, REMAINS FIRMLY IN CONTROL OF PARTY, GOVERNMENT, AND SOCIETY IN NORTH
KOREA; HE APPARENTLY MAKES ALL MAJOR POLICY DECISIONS
HIMSELF. UNDER KIM'S REGIME, PYONGYANG HAS BEEN USING
POLITICAL AND DIPLOMATIC MEANS TO PURSUE ITS INTERNATIONAL
COMPETITION WITH SOUTH KOREA AND TO PROMOTE ITS LONG-TERM
GOAL OF KOREAN REUNIFICATION UNDER TERMS ACCEPTABLE TO
THE NORTH.
78. ALTHOUGH THE KOREAN PENINSULA HAS BEEN RELATIVELY
CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL
PAGE 32

STATE 046435

STABLE, NORTH KOREA HAS ALSO BEEN EMBARKED ON A MAJOR
BUILDUP OF ITS ARMED FORCES SINCE THE EARLY 1970'S.
U.S. INTELLIGENCE STUDIES STILL IN PREPARATION ARE EXPECTED TO CONCLUDE THAT NORTH KOREA'S FORCES ARE LARGER
THAN PREVIOUSLY BELIEVED, POSSIBLY NUMBERING 41 DIVISIONS
OR BRIGADES, 600,000 MEN, 610 TACTICAL AIRCRAFT, AND
2,700 TANKS. WHILE MAINTAINING AND EXPANDING THESE
FORCES, NORTH KOREA HAS ALSO BEEN SEEKING TO DEVELOP
SELF-RELIANCE IN THE MILITARY FIELD AND NOW MANUFACTURES
ITS OWN TANKS, ASSAULT GUNS, NAVAL SURFACE CRAFT, AND
SUBMARINES.
79. THERE ARE SOME SIGNS OF DOMESTIC DIFFICULTIES IN THE
PYONGYANG REGIME. KIM'S 37-YEAR-OLD SON KIM CHONG-IL HAS
EMERGED IN RECENT YEARS AS A MAJOR POLICY FIGURE, APPARENTLY WITH LITTLE SUPPORT FROM THE MILITARY. WE ARE
UNCERTAIN, HOWEVER, WHETHER KIM IS SEEKING TO GROOM HIS
SON AS HIS OWN SUCCESSOR OR, IF SO, WHETHER THE EFFORT
HAS BROAD SUPPORT. APPARENTLY, THERE IS ALSO SOME
INTERNAL DEBATE OVER MILITARY VERSUS ECONOMIC PRIORITIEOVER THE EXTENT OF NORTH KOREA'S NEED FOR OUTSIDE
MILITARY ASSISTANCE, AND OVER THE CORRECT STRATEGY FOR
PURSUING THE GOAL OF REUNIFICATION.
80. EARLY THIS YEAR, NORTH KOREA RESPONDED TO A PROPOSAL
FOR TALKS BY ROK PRESIDENT PARK CHUNG-HEE, INDICATING ITS
WILLINGNESS TO RENEW THE 1972-73 POLITICAL DIALOGUE
BETWEEN THE TWO KOREAN STATES. THIS MARKED A REVERSAL OF
PYONGYANG'S POSITION, AS OF THE MID-1970'S, THAT NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE PRESENT LEADERS IN SEOUL WOULD BE FUTILE
UNTIL THERE OCCURRED SOME FUNDAMENTAL CHANGE IN SOUTH
KOREAN POLICY. THE NORTH APPARENTLY HAS TACTICAL MOTIVES
FOR PARTICIPATING IN NEW TALKS, INCLUDING ITS HOPE THAT

REDUCED TENSIONS WILL INFLUENCE THE U.S. TO CONTINUE
ITS TROOP WITHDRAWALS. PYONGYANG MAY HAVE BEEN
INFLUENCED TOWARD A MORE &quot;MODERATE&quot; STANCE BY THE NORMALIZATION OF RELATIONS BETWEEN THE U.S. AND THE PEOPLES
REPUBLIC OF CHINA. THE HISTORY OF DIFFERENCES WITH THE
SOUTH IS SUCH, HOWEVER, THAT CONCRETE RESULTS, IF ANY,
WILL LIKELY TAKE TIME AND COMPROMISE BY BOTH SIDES.
81. NORTH KOREA ENJOYS CLOSE TIES WITH PEKING; BOTH
PREMIER HUA KUO-FENG AND VICE PREMIER TENG HSIAO-P'ING
VISITED PYONGYANG IN 1978. CHINA CONTINUES TO PROVIDE
SOME MILITARY HARDWARE TO THE KOREANS. THERE WERE NO
COMPARABLE SOVIET VISITS, AND SOVIET MILITARY ASSISTANCE
SINCE 1973 HAS REMAINED AT A VIRTUAL TOKEN LEVEL.
82. FAR FROM SEEING ITSELF AS A PAWN BETWEEN PEKING AND
MOSCOW, PYONGYANG PERCEIVES ITSELF AS GUARDING ITS OWN
INDEPENDENCE OF ACTION TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE. BECAUSE
NEITHER THE USSR NOR THE CHINESE ARE LIKELY TO SUPPORT
ACTUAL HOSTILITIES ON THE KOREAN PENINSULA, PYONGYANG
APPEARS TO FEEL THAT ITS MILITARY POSTURE, TO BE CREDIBLE,
MUST RELY ON NEITHER. NORTH KOREA APPARENTLY HAS SUCCEEDED IN DEVELOPING THE CAPABILITY TO ATTACK THE SOUTH, AND
TO SUSTAIN OPERATIONS FOR SEVERAL WEEKS WITHOUT DE
HELP.
83. NORTH KOREA FACES SERIOUS INTERNATIONAL DEBT PROBLEMS
WITH BOTH ITS COMMUNIST ALLIES AND ITS WESTERN TRADING
PARTNERS ($1.65 BILLION) AND HAS AVOIDED MAJOR DEFAULTS
ONLY BY OBTAINING LONG-TERM RESCHEDULING OF DEBTS. AT
HOME, THE NEW SEVEN-YEAR-ECONOMIC PLAN FOR THE PERIOD
1978-84 HAS MORE MODEST GOALS THAN EARLIER PLANS AND
ACKNOWLEDGES SEVERE DIFFICULTIES WITH INDUSTRY, TRANSPORTATION, MINING, AND THE PRODUCTION AND DISTRIBUTION
OF FOOD.

84. ALTHOUGH SOME OF KIM IL-SONG'S SUBORDINATES UNDOUBTEDLY SEE THE MILITARY OPTION AS REALISTIC, NORTH
KOREA APPEARS LIKELY TO REFRAIN FROM PROVOCATIVE ACTIONS
AS LONG AS AN EMBRYONIC DIALOGUE WITH THE SOUTH IS
DEVELOPING, AND AS LONG AS THE U.S. MILITARY COMMITMENT
TO SOUTH KOREA REMAINS FIRM. PYONGYANG PROBABLY WILL
CONTINUE TO SEEK TO AVOID THE ANNUAL UNITED NATIONS DEBATE
ON THE KOREAN QUESTION THIS YEAR. NORTH KOREA WILL CON-

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
TINUE TO SEARCH FOR SIGNS OF WEAKNESS IN THE GOVERNMENT
AND SOCIETY OF SOUTH KOREA AND TO EXPLOIT ANY OPPORTUNITIES CREATED BY CHANGES IN THE SOUTH.
B. SOUTH KOREA
85. SOUTH KOREA'S CLOSE TIES WITH THE UNITED STATES HAVE
LARGELY RETURNED TO NORMAL FOLLOWING SEVERAL YEARS OF
STRAIN CAUSED BY THE &quot;KOREAGATE&quot; CONTROVERSY, AMERICAN
CONCERN OVER THE RESTRAINTS ON PEACEFUL DISSENT IN KOREA,
AND MISPERCEPTIONS OF U.S. INTENTIONS IN CONNECTION WITH
THE CAREFULLY PHASED WITHDRAWAL FROM KOREA OF AMERICAN
GROUND COMBAT TROOPS. PRESIDENT PARK CHUNG-HEE AND
KOREAN LEADERS HAVE BEEN REASSURED BY THE CLOSE CONSULTATIONS THEY HAVE HAD WITH WASHINGTON OVER MATTERS OF
MUTUAL CONCERN THIS PAST YEAR, AND BY THE US COMMITMENT
TO KEEP UNDER REVIEW ITS TROOP WITHDRAWAL POLICY. ON
FEBRUARY 9, PRESIDENT CARTER STATED THAT FURTHER WITHDRAWALS OF U.S. FORCES WILL BE HELD IN ABEYANCE PENDING
THE OUTCOME OF A NEW EXAMINATION OF NORTH KOREA'S FORCEND INTENTIONS AS WELL AS OTHER DEVELOPMENTS IN THE
REGION. THAT ASSESSMENT SHOULD BE COMPLETED BY MID-1979.
86. THE CLOSE ROK-US MILITARY RELATIONSHIP WAS FURTHER
CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL
PAGE 35

STATE 046435

ENHANCED IN NOVEMBER 1978 BY A STRENGTHENING OF US
TACTICAL AIRPOWER IN KOREA AND BY INAUGURATION OF A
COMBINED FORCES COMMAND, UNDER WHICH AMERICAN AND KOREAN
OFFICERS SHARE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE DEFENSE OF SOUTH
KOREA.
87. SOUTH KOREA'S IMPRESSIVE ECONOMIC GROWTH MAKES THE
ROK A MAJOR PARTICIPANT IN THE INTERNATIONAL TRADING
SYSTEM, BOTH AS A SUPPLIER OF QUALITY GOODS AND AS A
MAJOR AND GROWING MARKET. SOUTH KOREA'S DOMESTIC ECONOMY
EXCEEDED ITS 1978 GROWTH RATE TARGET OF 12 PER CENT AND
THE FOREIGN TRADE PICTURE APPEARS ENCOURAGING. DEPENDENCE
ON PETROLEUM IMPORTS FROM OUTSIDE SUPPLIERS HAS CONTRIBUTED TO HEAVY INVESTMENT IN A MAJOR NUCLEAR ELECTRIC
POWER PROGRAM. AS HAS BEEN THE CASE IN RECENT YEARS, ROK
ECONOMIC GROWTH CONTINUED TO BE GREATER THAN THAT OF NORTH
KOREA.
88. THE DOMESTIC POLITICAL CLIMATE IN SOUTH KOREA WAS
IMPROVED IN 1978 BY THE GOVERNMENT'S RELEASE OF PROMINENT
DISSIDENT FIGURES AND BY FAIRLY CONDUCTED NATIONAL
ASSEMBLY ELECTIONS IN DECEMBER. IN THE ELECTIONS, THE
OPPOSITION NEW DEMOCRATIC PARTY WON A SLIGHT PLURALITY
OF THE POPULAR VOTE, ALTHOUGH THE GOVERNMENT DEMOCRATIC
REPUBLICAN PARTY RETAINED CONTROL OF THE LEGISLATURE.

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
WHILE THERE REMAIN LEGAL CONSTRAINTS ON DIRECTLY CRITICIZING PRESIDENT PARK OR THE CONSTITUTION, POLITICAL DISSIDENTS HAVE ENJOYED GREATER FREEDOM TO SPEAK OUT ON PUBLIC
ISSUES AND MOST SOUTH KOREAN CITIZENS GENERALLY SUPPORT
THEIR GOVERNMENT AND ITS POLICIES.
89. THE CURRENT, TENTATIVE CONTACTS WITH NORTH KOREA-AIMED AT RESUMING THE NORTH-SOUTH DIALOGUE WHICH WAS
DISCONTINUED IN 1973--EVOLVED FROM A JANUARY 19 OFFER BY
PRESIDENT PARK TO HOLD MEETINGS BETWEEN THE AUTHORITIES
CONFIDENTIAL
CONTIAL
PAGE 36

STATE 046435

OF THE TWO SIDES AT ANY TIME, AT ANY LEVEL. PRESIDENT
PARK APPEARS TO FEEL THAT HE CAN DEAL WITH THE NORTH
KOREANS FROM A POSITION OF STRENGTH AND CONFIDENCE, AND
WHILE SERIOUS DIFFERENCES BETWEEN SEOUL AND PYONGYANG
CLOUD THE FUTURE OF THESE CONTACTS, WE BELIEVE THE ROK IS
COMMITTED TO TESTING ANY OPPORTUNITY FOR MEANINGFUL
DIALOGUE BETWEEN RESPONSIBLE OFFICIALS. SEOUL WILL
PROCEED CAUTIOUSLY IN THESE PRELIMINARY MEETINGS, HOPING
FOR GENUINE PROGRESS, BUT WARY OF RAISING PUBLIC EXPECTATIONS UNDULY.
90. SOUTH KOREA'S DOMESTIC CONFIDENCE AND CLOSE TIES WITH
THE US PROVIDE A FIRM BASIS FOR ITS MORE INNOVATIVE AND
FLEXIBLE FOREIGN POLICY. THE ROK HAS ADOPTED INCREASINGLY FLEXIBLE POSITIONS TOWARD ITS COMMUNIST NEIGHBORS.
ROK LEADERS ARE SERIOUSLY INTERESTED IN ESTABLISHING
SOME FORM OF RELATIONSHIP WITH BOTH PEKING AND MOSCOW.
IN 1978, A SOUTH KOREAN CABINET OFFICIAL ATTENDED AN
INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE IN THE USSR FOR THE FIRST TIME,
AND PRESIDENT PARK HAS INDICATED THAT HE HOPES TO SEE
FURTHER CONTACT.
91. ALTHOUGH THERE HAS BEEN NO SIGNIFICANT RESPONSE TO
ROK OVERTURES FROM THE SOVIET OR CHINESE CAPITALS, WE
BELIEVE ATTITUDES IN BOTH PEKING AND MOSCOW SEEM RECEPTIVE TO DEVELOPMENT OF SOME CONTACTS AT AN APPROPRIATE
TIME. FOR THE PRESENT EACH PREFERS NOT TO CREATE STRAINS
IN ITS RELATIONSHIP WITH NORTH KOREA WHICH COULD BE
EXPLOITED BY THE OTHER, OR CREATE DIVERSIONS WHICH MIGHT
DETRACT FROM THE IMPETUS FOR DIRECT NORTH-SOUTH KOREAN
CONTACTS.

CONTACTS WITH NORTH KOREA IN A SYMMETRICAL FASHION IF
NORTH KOREA'S PRINCIPAL ALLIES ARE PREPARED TO DO THE
SAME WITH THE REPUBLIC OF KOREA. AT THIS TIME, HOWEVER,
IT IS ALSO OUR EVALUATION THAT NO STEP SHOULD BE TAKEN
WHICH COULD DIMINISH THE INCENTIVES FOR NORTH KOREA TO
DEALMATICALLY AND DIRECTLY WITH SEOUL. ALTHOUGH WE
ARE GRATIFIED AT THE INITIATION OF NEW CONTACTS BETWEEN
NORTH AND SOUTH, IT IS CLEARLY TOO EARLY TO DETERMINE
WHETHER PYONGYANG IS PREPARED TO DEAL REALISTICALLY WITH
MAJOR OUTSTANDING ISSUES IN A MANNER WHICH ULTIMATELY CAN
LEAD TO A REDUCTION OF TENSIONS ON THE PENINSULA. MEANWHILE, THERE SHOULD BE NO DOUBT IN THE MIND OF ANY
POTENTIAL ADVERSARY OF THE FIRM, OPEN U.S. COMMITMENT
TO OUR DEFENSE TREATY WITH THE REPUBLIC OF KOREA.
IV. SOUTHEAST ASIA
93. A. VIETNAM DOMESTIC POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC SITUATION.
THE ECONOMIC INTEGRATION AND SOCIAL ASSIMILATION OF
SOUTHERN VIETNAM INTO THE COMMUNIST SYSTEM CONTINUES TO
POSE SERIOUS DIFFICULTIES FOR HANOI. IT WILL TAKE YEARS
TO REMAKE THE STRUCTURE AND VALUES OF SOUTHERN SOCIETY,
AND UNTIL THEN HANOI WILL HAVE TO DEAL WITH A RESENTFUL
AN;D UNTRUSTWORTHY POPULATION. STRINGENT POPULATION CONTROLS ARE IN EFFECT, BUT THERE IS LITTLE EVIDENCE OF
VIOLENT REPRISALS BY THE VICTORIOUS NORTHERNERS. NORTH
VIETNAMESE HOLD ALMOST ALL POSITIONS OF IMPORTANCE IN THE
SOUTH,MAKING REUNIFICATION APPEAR LITTLE MORE THAN A
EUPHEMISM FOR NORTHERN DOMINATION.
94. SCATTERED ANTIGOVERNMENT VIOLENCE, INCLUDING SABOTAGE,
AMBUSH OF SECURITY UNITS, AND ASSASSINATION OF MILITARY
AND PUBLIC SECURITY OFFICIALS OCCURS THROUGHOUT THE SOUTH
BUT POSES NO THREAT TO THE STABILITY OF THE REGIME. IMPORTANT SOURCES OF DISSIDENCE ARE THE MONTAGNARDS IN THE
CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL
PAGE 38

STATE 046435

HIGHLANDS, REMNANTS OF THE SOUTH VIETNAMESE ARMY IN THE
SOUTHERN BORDER PROVINCES, AND MEMBERS OF THE CAO DAI AND
HOA HAO SECTS AND CATHOLIC COMMUNITIES IN THE MEKONG DELTA
REGION. THESE GROUPS DO NOT COORDINATE THEIR ACTIVITIES,
HOWEVER, AND OFTEN THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN RESISTANCE AND
BANDITRY IS BLURRED.
95. THE LIMITATIONS OF THE VIETNAMESE BUREAUCRACY PROBABLY
ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT OBSTACLEHE REGIME'S ABILITY TO
IMPLEMENT DOMESTIC ECONOMIC AND ADMINISTRATIVE REFORMS.
THERE IS A MARKED LACK OF COORDINATION AND COOPERATION

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
AMONG GOVERNMENT ENTITIES WHICH ARE COMPARTMENTALIZED,
JEALOUS OF THE PREROGATIVES, AND SECRETIVE IN DEALING WITH
EACH OTHER. EVEN THE SIMPLEST ISSUES AND DECISIONS TEND
TO BECOME MIRED IN RED TAPE AND SUBJECT TO CONSIDERATION
AT RELATIVELY HIGH LEVELS. THE CONTROLLED PRESS PUBLISHES
NUMEROUS ALLEGATIONS OF INEFFICIENCY, CORRUPTION, AND
ARROGANCE IN THE BUREAUCRACY.
96. MORE THAN THREE YEARS AFTER THE FALL OF SAIGON AND
OVER TWO YEARS SINCE HANOI'S DECLARATION OF UNIFICATION,
THERE HAS BEEN LITTLE PROGRESS IN RAISING VIETNAMESE OUTPUT AND LIVING STANDARDS BEYOND LEVELS OF 15 YEARS AGO.
THE LARGELY AGRICULTURAL, MARKET ORIENTED SOUTHERN ECONOMY
HAS YET TO RECOVER FROM ITS NEAR COLLAPSE OF 1975 AND IS
ONLY SLOWLY BEING INTEGRATED INTO THE MORE INDUSTRIALIZED,
COMMUNIST SYSTEM OF THE NORTH.
97. OUTPUT GOALS UNDER THE CURRENT FIVE YEAR PLAN
(1976-80) AND THE RAPID DEVELOPMENT OF AN EFFICIENT
INTEGRATED ECONOMY ARE BECOMING LESS AND LESS ATTAINABLE.
TARGETS FOR GAINS IN GROSS NATIONAL PRODUCT (GNP)
CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL
PAGE 39

STATE 046435

AVERAGING ABOUT 15 ANNUALLY AND FOR ACHIEVING FOOD SELF
SUFFICIENCY BY 1980 ARE NOW WELL OUT OF REACH. LAST YEAR,
FOR EXAMPLE, REAL GNP WAS ONLY 3 ABOVE 1974. AT THE SAME
TIME, HANOI HAD TO IMPORT 1.5 MILLION TONS OF WHEAT AND
RICE. IMPORTS THIS YEAR WILL BE EVEN GREATER BECAUSE OF
SEVERE FLOOD DAMAGE.
98. LACK OF PROGRESS IN ATTAINING ECONOMIC GOALS IS
APPARENTLY STRENGTHENING PRESSURES WITHIN THE HANOI POLITBURO TO PUSH FOR MORE RAPID INTEGRATION OF BOTH ECONOMIES
BEFORE 1980. THUS, IN MARCH 1978 THE GOVERNMENT NATIONALIZED THE COMMERCIAL SECTOR IN THE SOUTH. THE ACTION,
WHICH STRUCK HEAVILY AT VIETNAM'S 1.5 MILLION ETHNIC
CHINESE, WAS INTENDED TO ELIMINATE THE FREEWHEELING PRI- MARKET IN THE SOUTH AND TO BRING THE DISTRIBUTION
AND PRICING OF SCARCE COMMODITIES FULLY WITHIN THE
GOVERNMENT ORBIT.
99. FOR THE MOMENT, HANOI REMAINS WARY OF SOCIALIZING
LAND HOLDINGS TOO QUICKLY IN THE SENSITIVE SOUTHERN
AGRICULTURAL SECTOR. MOST ESTABLISHED FARMS IN THE MEKONG
DELTA REMAIN PRIVATELY OWNED, EVEN THOUGH FARMERS MUST
INCREASINGLY DEAL WITH STATE AGENCIES IN PURCHASING
NECESSARY INPUTS AND DISPOSING OF THEIR PRODUCTS. DESPITE
THIS GO-SLOW APPROACH IN EXPANDING STATE OWNERSHIP,
AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION IN THE SOUTH HAS LAGGED. MEKONG
DELTA FARMERS BELIEVE GOVERNMENT TAKEOVER OF THEIR LAND
IS INEVITABLE AND HAVE RESPONDED BY GROWING ONLY ENOUGH

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
TO MEET COMPULSORY SALES TO THE STATE AND THE NEEDS OF
THEIR FAMILIES.
100. HANOI'S MOST AMBITIOUS POSTWAR EFFORT IN AGRICULTURE
AND AT SOCIOECONOMIC REFORM IS EMBODIED IN THE &quot;NEW
ECONOMIC ZONES&quot; PRIMITIVE AREAS IN THE COUNTRY SIDE SET
ASIDE FOR AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT. THEY REPRESENT
HANOI'S EFFORTS TO DEAL WITH MILLIONS OF URBAN UNEMPLOYED,
LAGGING FOOD PRODUCTION, UNEVEN POPULATION DISTRIBUTION

AND INADEQUATE POLITICAL CONTROL IN SOME SOUTHERN AREAS.
ABOUT 1.5 MILLION PEOPLE HAVE BEEN MOVED, BUT MANY HAVE
DRIFTED BACK TO THE CITIES BECAUSE OF HARSH LIVING CONDITIONS IN THE NEW AREAS. SOFAR FEW IF ANY OF THESE AREAS
HAVE ACTUALLY SUPPLIED AN AGRICULTURAL SURPLUS TO THE
STATE.
101. VIETNAM'S CHRONIC TRADE GAP - $600 MILLION AND
GROWING - STILL MUST BE COVERED BY FOREIGN AID. THE BULK
OF POSTWAR AID - PLEDGES TOTALING $5.6 MILLION - IS BEING
SUPPLIED BY VIETNAM'S COMMUNIST ALLIES. CHINA'S SUSPENSION OF ECONOMIC AID TO VIETNAM WILL TROUBLE BUT NOT
CRIPPLE THE LANQUISHING ECONOMY. NON-COMMUNIST AID REMAINS
SMALL DESPITE AN INITIAL FLURRY OF POSTWAR OFFERS. MANY
WESTERN DONORS APPEAR TO HAVE BEEN TURNED OFF BY VIETNAM'S
DEMONSTRATED INABILITY TO A THE AMOUNT OF AID ALREADY
LINED UP.
FOREIGN RELATIONS
102.HANOI'S RELATIONS WITH PEKING DETERIORATED STEADILY
OVER THE PAST YEAR. TENSIONS WHICH ESCALATED AS A RESULT
OF CHINA'S SUPPORT TO THE POL POT REGIME IN ITS BORDER CONFLICT WITH VIETNAM WERE GREATLY EXACERBATED BY HANOI'S
INVASION AND OCCUPATION OF KAMPUCHEA. THIS HAS RESULTED
IN A SERIES OF MINOR INCIDENTS ALONG THE SINO-VIETNAMESE
BORDER, A LARGE SCALE CHINESE MILITARY BUILD UP THERE, AND
THE PRESENT CONFLICT BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES. AT THE
SAME TIME, HANOI MOVED CLOSER TO THE USSR HAVING JOINED
CEMA IN JUNE OF 1978 AND SIGNING A PEACE AND FRIENDSHIP
TREATY WITH THE SOVIET UNION LAST NOVEMBER, JUST TWO
MONTHS PRIOR TO ITS INVASION OF KAMPUCHEA.

103.THE USSR AND ITS EAST EUROPEAN ALLIES WILL PROVIDE
SOME ADDITIONAL ECONOMIC ASSISTANCE TO COMPENSATE FOR THE
CURTAILING OF CHINESE AID. AN IMPORTANT FACTOR IN VIETNAM'S DECISION TO JOIN CEMA WAS UNDOUBTEDLY A BELIEF THAT
THIS WOULD BRING INCREASED ASSISTANCE. ALTHOUGH MEMBERSHIP
IS UNLIKELY TO BRING SUBSTANTIAL LOANS UNDER CEMA AUSPICES,
IT SHOULD FACILITATE THE FLOW OF BILATERAL AID AND TRADE
ON MORE FAVORABLE TERMS.
104.VIETNAM MADE EXTENSIVE EFFORTS TO IMPROVE RELATIONS
WITH ASEAN AS AN ORGANIZATION AS WELL AS WITH INDIVIDUAL
ASEAN STATES.DURING THE PAST YEAR. THESE EFFORTS INCLUDED
A SERIES OF VISITS BY HIGH RANKING VIETNAMESE OFFICIALS
WHO ATTEMPTED TO PERSUADE THE ASEAN STATES OF HANOI'S
INTEREST IN COOPERATING TO PROMOTE REGIO;AL STABILITY AND
DEVELOPMENT. DESPITE THESE EFFORTS, HANOI'S INVASION OF
KAMPUCHEA HAS RAISED SERIOUS DOUBTS, PARTICULARLY IN
THAILAND, CONCERNING THE PROSPECTS FOR DEVELOPING SATISFACTORY RELATIONS WITH THE HANOI REGIME.
B. THE SITUATION IN KAMPUCHEA.
105.THERE IS ESSENTIALLY NO FUNCTIONING COUNTRY-WIDE
GOVERNMENT IN KAMPUCHEA TODAY. DESPITE ITS LIGHTNINAKEOVER OF THE COUNTRY IN EARLY JANUARY, VIETNAMESE
FORCES APPEAR TO HAVE BECOME MIRED IN WHAT MAY BECOME A
PROTRACTED CONFLICT. ALTHOUGH VIETNAMESE FORCES CONTINUE
TO ATTACK POSSIBLE DEMOCRATIC KAMPUCHEAN (DK) BASE AREAS,
THE DK FORCES THUS FAR APPEAR ABLE TO SUSTAIN HARASSING
GUERRILLA TACTICS AND HAVE BEEN ABLE THUS FAR TO PREVENT
ANY MEANINGFUL CONSOLIDATION OF VIETNAMESE GAINS.
106.HANOI'S BLITZ OF KAMPUCHEA IN EARLY JANUARY 1979 LEFT
IT IN CONTROL OF PHNOM PENH, MOST PROVINCIAL CAPITALS,

PAGE 42

AIRFIELDS, COMMUNICATIONS POINTS, THE DEEPWATER PORT OF
KAMPONG SOM, AND THE FISHING PORT AT KAMPOT. NEVERTHELESS, AFTER RECOVERY FROM THE INITIAL SHOCK, DK FORCES,
MANY OF WHICH WERE SIMPLY BY-PASSED BY THE MOTORIZED
VIETNAMESE COLUMNS, HAVE REGROUPED, REGAINED RADIO CONTACT,
AND LAUNCHED WIDESPREAD COUNTER-ATTACKS.
107. VIETNAM FACES VERY DIFFICULT PROBLEMS IN TRYING TO
ESTABLISH A PUPPET STATE IN KAMPUCHEA. ALTHOUGH THERE ARE
NUMEROUS DIMENSIONS TO THE TASK, IT WOULD SEEM TO DEPEND
PRIMARILY UPON: WHETHER HANOI CAN ESTABLISH GENERAL POPULATION AND COMMUNICATION CONTROL THROUGHOUT MOST OF KAMPUCHEA
SO THAT THE HENG SAMRIN ADMINISTRATION CAN BE SET IN PLACE;

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
HOW QUICKLY THE VIETNAMESE CAN TRAIN A KHMER POLITICALADMINISTRATIVE SYSTEM TO GOVERN KAMPUCHEA; AND WHETHER
THIS CAN BE DONE RAPIDLY, BEFORE POPULAR KHMER RESENTMENT
BEGINS TO BUILD BECAUSE OF THE LARGE VIETNAMESE PRESENCE
THROUGHOUT KAMPUCHEA. ON THE KAMPUCHEA SIDE THE BASIC
QUESTIONS INCLUDE: WHETHER THEY CAN ESTABLISH ADEQUATE
SUPPLY CHANNELS OVER THE LONGER RUN EITHER FROM EXTERNAL
SOURCES, OR THROUGH CAPTURE OF FOOD, AMMUNITION, AND
WEAPONS FROM THE VIETNAMESE THEMSELVES AND WHETHER THE DK
FORCES CAN OVERCOME THE DEVASTATING UNPOPULARITY OF THE
POL POT REGIME AND BUILD TIES WITH THE KHMER PEOPLE WHICH
WILL ENABLE THEM TO STRENGTHEN AND MAINTAIN RESISTANCE TO
THENAMESE.
C. ASEAN
108. DURING THE PAST YEAR, AND PARTICULARLY THE LAST SIX
MONTHS, THE FIVE MEMBERS OF THE ASSOCIATION OF SOUTHEAST
ASIAN NATIONS HAVE DEMONSTRATED A NEW DEGREE OF POLITICAL
AND DIPLOMATIC COOPERATION, IN ADDITION TO CONTINUING
CONFIDENTIAL

PAGE 43

STATE 046435

ECONOMIC, SOCIAL AND CULTURAL COOPERATION. POLITICAL
COOPERATION IS REFLECTED IN COORDINATION OF POSITIONS IN
DIALOGUES WITH MAJOR INDUSTRIALIZED-NATION ECONOMIC
PARTNERS--INCLUDING THE FIRST ASEAN-EEC MINISTERIALLEVEL CONFERENCE IN NOVEMBER--AND WITH VISITING VIETNAMESE,
CHINESE AND SOVIET OFFICIALS.
109. WHILE THE INDIVIDUAL MEMBERS PRIVATELY DIFFER OVER
THE NATURE AND SEVERITY OF THE THREAT TO THEIR SECURITY,
AS A GROUP THEY HAVE RESPONDED PUBLICLY TO VIETNAM'S
INVASION OF KAMPUCHEA AND CHINA'S OF VIETNAM WITH A STRONG
AND UNANIMOUS VOICE DEPLORING THE AGGRESSION AND REAFFIRMING ASEAN SOLIDARITY. THE TWO ASEAN STATEMENTS TO VIETNAM (JANUARY 13) AND TO CHINA (FEBRUARY 20)--ARE SIMILAR:
BOTH WERE ISSUED QUICKLY, DO NOT IDENTIFY ANY OF THE
BELLIGERENTS, AND REFLECT THE ASEAN MEMBERS' DETERMINATION TO REMAIN BOTH UNINVOLVED IN THE CONFLICTS AND
CONCILIATORY TOWARD ALL PARTIES.
110. THE ASEAN MEMBERS ARE LIKELY TO CONTINUE TO VALUE
THEIR UNITY AND TO PURSUE A COORDINATED, TWO-TRACK POLICY
TOWARD POTENTIAL EXTERNAL THREATS: CONCILATORY DIPLOMACY
COMBINED WITH ENHANCEMENT OF INDIVIDUAL AND COLLECTIVE
DEFENSE CAPABILITIES. IN RESPONSE TO THE GROWING NUMBER
OF INDOCHINESE REFUGEES LANDING ON THEIR SHORES, THE FIVE
STATES HAVE AGREED TO APPROACH HANOI TO STOP THE FLOW,
TO ASK THIRD COUNTRIES AND THE UN TO RE-SETTLE MORE OF
THE EXISTING REFUGEES, AND TO PROVIDE AN ISLAND HOLDING

OF THE GOVERNING POLITICAL COALITION, THE NATIONAL FRONT,

COMMUNITIES (THE MALAYS AND THE CHINESE.)

--MALAY ATTEMPTS TO OBTAIN A LARGER SHARE OF THE ECONOMIC
REWARDS HAVE ALIENATED MANY CHINESE AND INDIANS.
--THE DISTURBING TREND TOWARD RACIAL POLARIZATION IS ALSO
REFLECTED IN THE GROWING IDENTIFICATION OF THE MALAY
COMMUNITY WITH WORLD-WIDE ISLAMIC RESURGENCE. THE MALAY
MUSLIM &quot;DAKWAH&quot; MOVEMENT, AS YET UNORGANIZED, HAS BECOME
AN INTEREST GROUP TO BE RECKONED WITH IN MALAYSIAN POLITICS.
112. DURING THE PAST SEVERAL MONTHS, THE CONTINUING
ARRIVAL OF PREDOMINANTLY ETHNIC CHINESE REFUGEES FROM
VIETNAM ON MALAYSIA'S EAST COAST HAS CAUSED SEVERE
DOMESTIC SOCIAL AND POLITICAL DISLOCATIONS. UNDER PRESSURE FROM WITHIN THE GOVERNING PARTY, FROM RURAL MALAY
CONSTITUENTS IN THE HEAVILY AFFECTED COASTAL AREAS, AND
FROM CHAUVINIST MUSLIM OPPOSITION, THE MALAYSIAN GOVERNMENT HAS HARDENED ITS POLICY OF PROVIDING FIRST ASYLUM
TO INDOCHINESE REFUGEES.
113. IN FOREIGN AFFAIRS, MALAYSIA HAS ATTEMPTED TO MAINTAIN ITS CREDENTIALS AS A NON-ALIGNED NATION. BUT, AT
THE SAME TIME, IT HAS SOUGHT BOTH TO RETAIN CORDIAL
RELATIONS WITH WESTERN NATIONS AND TO IDENTIFY MORE
CLOSELY WITH THE ISLAMIC WORLD. WITHIN THE IMMEDIATE
REGION, MALAYSIA IS AN ACTIVE MEMBER OF ASEAN AND FAVORS
A CONCILIATORY APPROACH TOWARD ITS COMMUNIST NEIGHBORS.

FEELS EXTREMELY VULNERABLE TO POTENTIALLY UNFAVORABLE
POLITICAL CHANGES IN THE IMMEDIATE REGION. CONSEQUENTLY,
DESPITE ITS HIGH LEVEL OF DEVELOPMENT (WHICH IN TERM OF
PER CAPITA GNP WOULD CATAGORIZE IT AS A DEVELOPED COUNTRY)
AND DIVERGENT ECONOMIC INTERESTS, SINGAPORE IS DRIVEN BY
POLITICAL AND SECURITY CONCERNS TO FOSTER CLOSE, COOPERATIVE RELATIONSHIPS WITH ITS FOUR ASEAN PARTNERS ON BOTH
REGIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL ISSUES. SINGAPORE IS SENSITIVE
TO LONG TERM SOVIET INTENTIONS IN THE REGION AND HAS OFTEN
VOICED ITS SUPPORT FOR CONTINUED US AND WESTERN PRESENCE
IN SOUTHEAST ASIA. IN THIS REGARD, SINGAPORE ALLOWS US
NAVAL VESSELS AND AIRCRAFT TO UTILIZE PORT AND AIRFIELD
FACILITIES.
116. THAILAND.
PRIME MINISTER KRIANGSAK, WHO SEIZED POWER IN A
BLOODLESS COUP IN OCTOBER 1977 AND PLEDGED AN EVENTUAL
RETURN TO DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENT, HAS MOVED THAILAND
CLOSER TO THAT GOAL. UNDER HIS LEADERSHIP, A NEW CONSTITUTION RESTORING A PARTIALLY ELECTED LEGISLATURE WAS
PROMULGATED ON DECEMBER 22. NATIONAL ELECTIONS HAVE BEEN
SCHEDULED FOR APRIL AND CAMPAIGNING BY A NUMBER OF RECENTLY RESURRECTED PARTIES IS UNDERWAY. KRIANGSAK'S PROSPECTS
FOR REMAINING IN OFFICE AFTER THE ELECTION ARE EXCELLENT,
LARGELY DUE TO HIS SKILLFUL BALANCING OF THE POLITICAL
FORCES UNLEASHED BY THE TWO MAJOR POLITICAL UPHEAVALS OF

THE LAST FIVE YEARS. HE HAS DEVELOPED IMPRESSIVE SUPPORT
FOR HIS MODERATE AND PRAGMATIC POLICIES. IN LAST OCTOBER'S DRAMATIC RESHUFFLE OF SENIOR MILITARY OFFICERS,
KRIANGSAK APPOINTED A HIGHLY RESPECTED PROFESSIONAL
OFFICER AND CLOSE FRIENDRMY COMMANDER. THIS AND
OTHER APPOINTMENTS VIRTUALLY RULE OUT THE POSSIBILITY OF
A MILITARY COUP AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT THROUGH THE CHAIN
OF COMMAND--THE KIND OF COUP WHICH BROUGHT DOWN THE LAST
ELECTED GOVERNMENT IN 1976.
117. THE GOVERNMENT TO BE ELECTED IN APRIL WILL BE CONFRONTED BY A NUMBER OF POTENTIALLY SERIOUS DOMESTIC
PROBLEMS. COMPREHENSIVE DEVELOPMENT STRATEGIES FOR

ADDRESSING THAILAND'S PRESSING RURAL PROBLEMS WILL HAVE
TO BE IMPLEMENTED SOON IF THAILAND IS TO ESCAPE THE
MALTHUSIAN SPECTRE WHICH HAUNTS ITS FUTURE. PROBLEMS IN
THE COUNTRYSIDE CONTINUE TO FEED THAILAND'S COMMUNIST
INSURGENCY WHICH, WHILE REMAINING CONTAINED, HAS HAD ITS
PROSPECTS IMPROVED BY THE CONSOLIDATION OF COMMUNIST
POWER IN NEIGHBORING INDOCHINA.
118. THE KRIANGSAK GOVERNMENT'S GREATEST SUCCESS HAVE
BEEN IN ORCHESTRATING AN EVEN-HANDED IMPROVEMENT IN
RELATIONS WITH CHINA AND VIETNAM. THE VIETNAMESE INVASION OF CAMBODIA AND THE SINO-VIETNAMESE BORDER WAR HAVE
CREATED EXTRAORDINARY CHALLENGES FOR THAI POLICY. WARY
OF VIETNAM'S LONG RANGE INTENTIONS TOWARD THAILAND AND
BANGKOK HAS NONETHELESS SOUGHT TO MAINTAIN THE MOMENTUM
OF RAPPROCHEMENT. IT CONTINUES TO IMPROVE RELATIONS WITH
CHINA, BUT AT THE SAME TIME, HAS STEADFASTLY MAINTAINED
A PUBLIC NEUTRALITY TOWARD THE SINO-VIETNAMESE CONFLICT.
RELATIONS WITH THE UNITED STATES REMAIN KEY AND THE
SPECIAL NATURE OF THAI/US SECURITY COOPERATION WAS

THAILAND ALSO CONTINUES TO REGARD ITS RELATIONS WITH THE
OTHER ASEAN COUNTRIES AS FUNDAMENTAL AND SOUGHT ASEAN
SOLIDARITY IN CONDEMNING THE VIETNAMESE INVASION OF
CAMBODIA.
119. INDONESIA. THE SUHARTO ADMINISTRATION ENTERED 1979
IN AS STRONG A POLITICAL POSITION AS IT HAS ENJOYED OVER
THE PAST FIVE YEARS. IT SEEMS TO BE PROFITING NOT ONLY
FROM A NATURAL LULL FOLLOWING THE ELECTORAL S OF THE
PAST TWO YEARS BUT ALSO FROM THE PREEMPTION OF OPPOSITION
CRITICISMS THROUGH NEW DEFENSE MINISTER JUSUF'S REFORM
MOVEMENT AIMED AT GOVERNMENTAL CORRUPTION AND POLITICAL
REPRESSION, AND BY THE THIRD FIVE-YEAR DEVELOPMENT PLAN'S
EMPHASIS ON EQUALIZING INCOME DISTRIBUTION. WHILE THE
GOVERNMENT HAS FOR THE MOMENT SEEMINGLY STOLEN THE
OPPOSITION'S THUNDER, IT HAS NOT WON THE HEARTS OF THE
DISSAFFECTED, WHICH CONTINUE TO INCLUDE A LARGE PERCENTAGE
OF UNIVERSITY STUDENTS, THE PRESS, THE EDUCATED ELITE AND
MILITANT MUSLIMS. IN PARTICULAR, THE GOVERNMENT WILL
CONTINUE TO HAVE DIFFICULTY MANAGING THE UNPOPULAR
ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL SIDE-EFFECTS OF THE 15 NOVEMBER DEVALUATION OF THE RUPIAH (BY ABOUT 33 PER CENT) AND THE
PLANNED 50 PER CENT INCREASE IN DOMESTIC OIL PRICES ON
APRIL 1.
120. IN FOREIGN AFFAIRS, INDONESIA IS A LEADING MODERATE
WITHIN THE GROUP OF 77 AND THE NON-ALIGNED MOVEMENT AND

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
GENERALLY FAVORS COOPERATION WITH THE UNITED STATES AND
WESTERN NATIONS. INDONESIA HAS DECIDED NOT TO NORMALIZE
RELATIONS WITH CHINA FOR THE TIME BEING. THE GOVERNMENT
REMAINS APPREHENSIVE ABOUT CHINESE INTENTIONS AND INFLUENCE
WITH THE ETHNIC CHINESE COMMUNITY IN INDONESIA. INDONESIA
MAINTAINS CORRECT BUT DISTANT RELATIONS WITH THE USSR AND
EASTERN BLOC COUNTRIES.

121. PHILIPPINES. AFTER SIX AND A HALF YEARS OF MARTIAL
LAW, PRESIDENT MARCOS REMAINS FIRMLY IN CONTROL. HIS MUCH
PUBLICIZED CAMPAIGN TO RESTORE &quot;POLITICAL NORMALCY&quot; HAS
RESULTED IN SOME LIBERALIZATION AND THE INTERIM NATIONAL
ASSEMBLY, ELECTED LAST YEAR, HAS PROVIDED A LIMITED FORUM
FOR POLITICAL DEBATE. DESPITE THESE DEVELOPMENTS, THERE
REMAIN FEW CHECKS ON MARCOS' EXECUTIVE POWER. THE MILITARY AND ECONOMIC ELITES CONTINUE TO BACK HIM, THOUGH
SOME ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE EXTENSIVE CORRUPTION IN THE
GOVERNMENT, PARTICULARLY IN MARCOS' INNER CIRCLE. IN THE
PAST TNTHS, MARCOS HAS INVEIGHED AGAINST CORRUPTION,
REMOVED A FEW OFFICIALS AND PUBLICLY LAUNCHED INVESTIGATIONS OF OTHERS, BUT CRITICS SEE THIS CAMPAIGN AS AN
ATTEMPT TO DEFLECT CRITICISM AWAY FROM HIS CLOSE SUPPORTERS.
122. MARCOS'S OPPOSITION APPEARS IN A QUANDARY. MARCOS'
LIBERALIZATION MEASURES SEEM TO HAVE DEFUSED SOME OF THE
EXPLOSIVE ISSUES SEIZED BY THE OPPOSITION LAST YEAR,
LEAVING LITTLE TO GALVANIZE A UNITED MOVEMENT AGAINST THE
GOVERNMENT. WITHIN THE RANKS OF HIS SUPPORTERS, FIRST
LADY IMELDA MARCOS' BID TO BECOME DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER
THREATENED DISUNITY AND MARCOS SEEMS TO HAVE SET ASIDE
INDEFINITELY THE IDEA OF NAMING HER AS HIS SUCCESSOR.
123. WHILE THE COMMUNIST INSURGENCY CONTINUES TO SPUTTER
AWAY IN A NUMBER OF PROVINCES, THE MUSLIM INSURGENCY IN
THE SOUTHERN PHILIPPINES HAS AGAIN TAKEN A TURN FOR THE
WORSE. IN SOME AREAS, FIGHTING HAS REACHED PRE-CEASE-FIRE
LEVELS. THE GOVERNMENT STILL SEEMS INTENT ON A MILITARY
SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEM, BUT IT IS ALSO EXPECTED TO TRY
TO ISOLATE THE INSURGENTS FROM THEIR ISLAMIC SUPPORTERS

124. MARCOS CONTINUES TO PURSUE A &quot;BALANCED FOREIGN
POLICY&quot; BUT IN RELATIONS WITH THE SOVIET UNION, CHINA,
VIETNAM, AND EVEN JAPAN, THE PHILIPPINES HAS SOUGHT TO
KEEP ITS POLICY CONSISTENT WITH THOSE OF THE OTHER ASEAN
STATES. DESPITE RHETORICAL SUPPORT FOR G-77 POSITIONS,
THE PHILIPPINES REMAINS RELATIVELY MODERATE ON NORTHSOUTH ISSUES AND IT IS EXPECTED TO AVOID EXTREME POSITIONS
AT THE UPCOMING UNCTAD V, (WHICH IT WILL HOST).
125. ON JANUARY 7, 1979, AN AMENDMENT OF THE 1947 MILITARY BASES AGREEMENT WAS SIGNED, CONCLUDING THE ROUND OF
NEGOTIATIONS WHICH BEGAN IN SEPTEMBER 1977. THE MAIN
THRUST OF THE AMENDMENT WAS TO REAFFIRM PHILIPPINE
SOVEREIGNTY OVER CLARK AIR BASE AND SUBIC BAY NAVAL BASE
WHILE ASSURING THE US CONTINUED AND EFFECTIVE COMMND
CONTROL OVER ESSENTIAL MILITARY FACILITIES. AS PART OF
THE AMENDED AGREEMENT, EACH BASE WAS PLACED UNDER PHILIPPINE COMMAND AND RESPONSIBILITY FOR PERIMETER SECURITY
WAS ASSUMED BY THE PHILIPPINE ARMED FORCES. THE RAISING
OF THE PHILIPPINE FLAG AT BOTH BASES ON FEBRUARY 16
MARKED THE FIRST STEP IN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE AMENDED
AGREEMENT.

126. INTERNAL. THE EUPHORIA OVER THE OUSTER OF INDIRA
GANDHI AND THE RESTORATION OF DEMOCRACY THAT ACCOMPANIED
THE JANATA PARTY'S ELECTORAL VICTORY IN 1977 HAS TURNED
INCREASINGLY TO PUBLIC DISILLUSIONMENT WITH THE DESAI
GOVERNMENT. THIS MOOD HAS BEEN EXACERBATED BY INFIGHTING AMONG THE PARTY'S SENIOR LEADERS OVER THE PAST SEVERAL
MONTHS. DESAI AVERTED A THREATENED PARTY SPLIT IN

JANUARY 1979 WHEN HE BROUGHT CHARAN SINGH BACK INTO THE
CABINET AS FINANCE MINISTER AND DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER.
WHILE PARTY COHESION REMAINS FRAGILE, FEW OBSERVERS PREDICT ITS IMMINENT FALL.
127. THE DISCONTENT HAS GIVEN MRS. GANDHI AN OPPORTUNITY
TO LAUNCH A POLITICAL COMEBACK, IN WHICH SHE HAS HAD SOME
SUCCESS. HER &quot;INDIRA&quot; CONGRESS PARTY ECLIPSED T;E
&quot;OFFICIAL&quot; CONGRESS IN STATE ELECTIONS, TAKING CONTROL
OF TWO LARGE SOUTHERN STATES AND ERODING THE JANATA BASE
IN THE NORTH. WHILE GANDHI WAS RETURNED TO PARLIAMENT
IN A NOVEMBER BY-ELECTION, SHE FACES SERIOUS OBSTACLES.
ON A JANATA INITATIVE IN DECEMBER SHE WAS EXPELLED FROM

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
PARLIAMENT AND BRIEFLY IMPRISONED. SHE STILL FACES A
STRING OF LEGAL CASES WHICH THE JANATA LEADERS HOPE WILL
KEEP HER ON THE DEFENSIVE.
128. THE INDIAN ECONOMY CURRENTLY IS IN RELATIVELY GOOD
SHAPE, LARGELY BECAUSE OF A SUCCESSION OF GOOD CROPS AND
MASSIVE REMITTANCES FROM OVERSEAS INDIANS. GOVERNMENT
PERFORMANCE HAS NOT, HOWEVER, MATCHED THE HIGH EXPECTATIONS AROUSED IN THE 1977 ELECTORAL CAMPAIGN, AND FUNDAMENTAL ILLS, SS UNEMPLOYMENT, SLUGGISH INDUSTRIAL
GROWTH, POVERTY AND A HIGH POPULATION GROWTH RATE REMAIN.
129. FOREIGN AFFAIRS. THE DESAI GOVERNMENT'S EFFORTS TO
BUILD GOOD RELATIONS WITH ITS SOUTH ASIAN NEIGHBORS HAVE
BEEN RELATIVELY SUCCESSFUL. AN INDO-NEPALI TRADE AND
TRANSIT AGREEMENT WAS SIGNED IN MARCH, AND IN FEBRUARY
1979 DESAI MADE A WELL-RECEIVED VISIT TO SRI LANKA.
DURING FOREIGN MINISTER VAJPAYEE'S VISIT TO PAKISTAN IN
EARLY 1978, BOTH SIDES AGREED TO SET ASIDE THE UNRESOLVED
KASHMIR ISSUE AND AGREED TO EXPAND CONSULAR SERVICES AND
CONFIDENTIAL

PAGE 51

STATE 046435

EXCHANGES. IN AUGUST, INDIA AGREED TO PERMIT BANGLADESH
AND NEPAL TRANSIT TRADE.
130. NEW DELHI REMAINS CONCERNED THAT POLITICAL UNREST
IN NEIGHBORING STATES WILL SPOIL THE PROSPECTS FOR A
STABLE SOUTH ASIA INSULATED FROM OUTSIDE INTERVENTION.
IT PARTICULARLY FEARS THAT PAKISTAN IN THE WAKE OF
DEVELOPMENTS IN IRAN AND AFGHANISTAN WILL SIGNIFICANTLY
STEP UP PURCHASE OF MILITARY HARDWARE AND BECOME LESS
WILLING TO RESOLVE BILATERAL INDO-PAKISTANI PROBLEMS.
131. CHINA AND INDIA SEEM PREPARED FOR THE FIRST TIME
SINCE THE 1962 SINO-INDIAN WAR TO TALK ABOUT FUNDAMENTAL
PROBLEMS, MOST NOTABLY THEIR DISPUTED BORDERS. IN MARCH
CHINA INVITED FOREIGN MINISTER VAJPAYEE TO VISIT, WHICH
HE DID IN FEBRUARY 1979. THE TWO SIDES AGREED THAT THE
DIFFICULT BORDER ISSUES SHOULD ;OT HINDER RAPPROCHEMENT.
HOWEVER, THE DESAI REGIME WAS EMBARRASSED BY THE CHINESE
INCURSION IN VIETNAM DURING VAJPAYEE'S VISIT, WHICH WILL
GIVE MRS. GANDHI MORE AMMUNITION AND MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR DESAI TO TAKE STEPS TO RESOLVE OUTSTANDING
PROBLEMS.
132. THE SOVIETS ARE CONCERNED THAT DESAI'S COMMITMENT
TO &quot;GENUINE NONALIGNMENT&quot; WILL ERODE INDO-SOVIET TIES.
MOSCOW'S FEARS ARE FUELED BY NEW DELHI'S PURCHASE OF
DEEP PENETRATION STRIKE AIRCRAFT FROM THE WEST, ITS HESITATION IN RECONIZING THE NEW KAMPUCHEA REGIME, AE

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014

PROSPECT OF IMPROVED SINO-INDIAN RELATIONS. HOWEVER, THE
INDIANS HAVE REPEATEDLY ASSURED MOSCOW THAT RAPPROACHEMENT
WITH THE PRC WOULD NOT BE AT THE EXPENSE OF THE USSR.
AT THE SAME TIME, THEY HAVE SUCCESSFULLY RESISTED SOVIET
BLANDISHMENTS SUCH AS BREZHNEV'S ASIAN COLLECTIVE
SECURITY SCHEME, AND THERE REMAIN COMPELLING REASONS FOR
NEW DELHI TO MAINTAIN GOOD RELATIONS WITH MOSCOW. THE
USSR REMAINS INDIA'S MAJOR SUPPLIER OF MILITARY ITEMS AND

PRIME MINISTER KOSYGIN WILL VISIT INDIA IN MARCH 1979.
B. PAKISTAN
133. INTERNAL SITUATION. PRESIDENT ZIA UL-HAQ'S MARTIAL
LAW ADMINISTRATION HAS MERELY SURVIVED ANOTHER YEAR. ZIA
TRIED TO PUT A BETTER FACE ON HIS GOVERNMENT IN AUGUST
BY APPOINTING A CABINET, INCLUDING CIVILIANS FROM
RELIGIOUS PARTIES, AND BY APPOINTING HIMSELF PRESIDENT ON
SEPTEMBER 16. DURING THE PAST TWELVE MONTHS, THE COUNTRY
HAS BEEN OBSESSED WITH THE BHUTTO MURDER CASE. IN LIGHT
OF THE SUPREME COURT'S DECISION TO UPHOLD THE DEATH VERDICT, A DECISION FOR CLEMENCY RESTS WITH PRESIDENT ZIA.
134. ZIA FACES SEVERE PROBLEMS WHETHER HE COMMUTES THE
SENTENCE OR NOT. IF HE LETS BHUTTO LIVE, HE WILL FACE
THE WRATH OF THOSE--INCLUDING HIS MILITARY CONSTITUENCY-WHO FEEL THAT BHUTTO SHOULD DIE. IF HE HANGS BHUTTO, HE
WILL FACE A PU0LIC REACTION BY BHUTTO SUPPORTERS AS WELL
AS INTERNATIONAL CONDEMNATION. ZIA'S SLIM CHANCE FOR SURVIVAL AS PRESIDENT PROBABLY LIES IN THE FACT THAT,WITHOUT
BHUTTO, THERE IS NO OTHER POLITICAL FIGURE BEHIND WHOM
PEOPLE CAN COALESCE.
135. THE ECONOMY, ALONG WITH OTHER DEVELOPMENT PROGRESS
IN THE COUNTRY, IS AT A STANDSTILL DUE TO THE ZIA
GOVERNMENT'S RELUCTANCE TO TAKE SUBSTANTIVE DECISIONS.
136. FOREIGN POLICY. PAKISTAN HAS HAD A DIFFICULT YEAR
EXTERNALLY AS WELL AS INTERNALLY. THE BHUTTO CASE
GENERATED SO MUCH ADVERSE PUBLICITY THAT MOST DONORS
SUSPENDED AID, INNG THE ERSTWHILE GENEROUS SHAH AND
THE SAUDIS. PAKISTAN STILL SEEKS DEBT RESCHEDULING, A

137. THE APRIL 1979 &quot;REVOLUTION&quot; IN AFGHANISTAN WAS
PERCEIVED IN ISLAMABAD AS INIMICAL TO PAKISTAN'S INTERESTS;
NOT ONLY DID IT BRING A PRO-USSR GROUP INTO POWER, BUT IT
KILLED THE DELICATE MOVEMENT TOWARD RAPPROACHEMENT WHICH
THE TWO GOVERNMENTS WERE WORKING OUT. PAKISTAN ALSO FEARS
THAT THE AFGHANS, BACKED BY THE SOVIETS, WILL ENCOURAGE
THE SEPARATIST SENTIMENT AMONG PAKISTAN'S TRIBALS,
ALTHOUGH THE TARAKI REGIME HAS HAD SO MUCH DIFFICULTY IN
CONS?LIDATING POWER IN ITS OWN EASTERN DISTRICTS THAT IT
HAS MADE NO MOVES SO FAR. PAKISTAN'S RELATIONS WITH INDIA
REMAIN STRAINED, PARTIALLY OVER INDIA'S QUICK RECOGNITION
OF THE NEW AFGHAN REGIME. ISLAMABAD'S CLOSE TIES WITH
CHINA REMAIN VERY GOOD, WITH PEKING SHARING ITS WORRY
ABOUT AFGHANISTAN. WHILE PAKISTAN HAS MADE MOTIONS TOWARDS
REACHING SOME SORT OF AN &quot;ACCOMMODATION&quot; WITH THE USSR,
THEY ARE GENERALLY PERCEIVED TO BE WITHOUT SUBSTANCE
BECAUSE OF OTHER CONSIDERATIONS. PAKISTAN'S PROBABLE
WITHDRAWAL FROM CENTO IN THE NEXT YEAR WILL MOST LIKELY
MEAN A CLOSER IDENTIFICATION WITH THIRD-WORLD COUNTRIES
IN THE NON-ALIGNED MOVEMENT.
C. AFGHANISTAN
138. INTERNAL SITUATION. THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF
AFGHANISTAN (DRA) CONTINUES TO TRY TO CONSOLIDATE ITS
HOLD ON THE KEY LEVERS OF POWER, INCLUDING THE MILITARY
AND THE BUREAUCRACY. THROUGH COMMITTEES TO DEFEND THE
REVOLUTION, ESTABLISHED BY THE PEOPLE'S DEMOCRATIC PARTY,
IT IS SLOWLY EXTENDING ITS INFLUENCE THROUGHOUT THE
COUNTRY. IN PURSUANCE OF ANNOUNCED ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL
GOALS, LAND REFORM IS UNDER WAY AND THE PREPARATION OF
THE FIVE YEAR PLAN IS RECEIVING HIGH PRIORITY.

139. AT THE SAME TIME, THERE ARE SERIOUS SIGNS OF STR
AND INDICATIONS OF TROUBLE AHEAD. SERIOUS DROUGHT AND
FOOD SHORTAGES ARE ANTICIPATED, WHICH COULD LEAD TO WIDESPREAD RESENTMENT. THE OPPOSITION OF CONSERVATIVE
RELIGIOUS LEADERS AND OF TRIBAL REBELS FIGHTING IN EASTERN AFGHANISTAN ARE OF MAJOR CONCERN TO THE DRA. THE
TARAKI GOVERNMENT CONTINUES TO TAKE HARSH REPRESSIVE
MEASURES AGAINST PERCEIVED SOURCES OF OPPOSITION, BUT HAS
BEEN UNABLE TO QUELL THE LOW-LEVEL REBELLIONS IN THE
EASTERN PROVINCES. EXILE DISSIDENT GROUPS, BASED IN PAKISTAN, ARE ISSUING EXAGGERATED PUBLICITY ABOUT THEIR
ACTIVITIES. THE RECENT KILLING OF THE AMERICAN AMBASSADOR
IN KABUL WILL AGAIN FOCUS ATTENTION ON THE DRA'S INTERNAL

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
PROBLEMS AND ITS CONTINUING RELIANCE ON SOVIET SUPPORT AND
ADVISORS.
140. FOREIGN AFFAIRS. THE TREATY OF FRIENDSHIP, GOOD
NEIGHBORLINESS AND COOPERATION WITH THE USSR SIGNED
DURING TARAKI'S VISIT TO MOSCOW IN EARLY DECEMBER STANDS
OUT AS THE CENTER-PIECE OF AFGHANISTAN'S FOREIGN POLICY.
SOVIET INFLUENCE IN AFGHANISTAN HAS INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY, AND SOVIET ADVISORS ARE STATIONED THROUGHOUT THE
GOVERNMENT AND ARMED FORCES. WE BELIEVE THAT TARAKI VIEWS
THE DECEMBER 5 TREATY AS A GUARANTEE OF HIS REGIME'S
SECURITY, BUT THAT THE SOVIETS WOULD EVALUATE ANY CRISIS
SITUATION IN TERMS OF THEIR BROADER FOREIGN POLICY
INTERESTS.
141. AFGHANISTAN HAS STRENGTHENED ITS TIES WITH THE
RADICAL ELEMENTS OF THE NON-ALIGNED MOVEMENT. KABUL WAS
ONE OF THE FIRST GOVERNMENTS TO RECOGNIZE THE NEW REGIME
IN CAMBODIA AND MORE RECENTLY TO CONDEMN THE CHINESE ATTACK ON VIETNAM. IT ALSO QUICKLY RECOGNIZED THE BAZARGAN

GOVERNMENT IN IRAN, AND HAS MAINTAINED CORRECT RELATIONS
WITH PAKISTAN, ALTHOUGH IT PRESERVES THE OPTION TO
ADOPT A MORE AGGRESSIVE POLICY ON PASHTUNISTAN AND
BALUCHISTAN. THE DRA SEEKS TO MAINTAIN GOOD RELATIONS
WITH INDIA.
142. AFTER THE TARAKI GOVERNMENT CAME TO POWEE U.S.
CONTINUED ITS MODEST PROGRAM OF ECONOMIC ASSISTANCE IN THE
INTERESTS OF REGIONAL STABILITY AND ACCESS. THE CIRCUMSTANCES SURROUNDING THE KILLING OF OUR AMBASSADOR HAVE,
HOWEVER, PUT A SERIOUS STRAIN ON RELATIONS. THIS,
TOGETHER WITH OTHER CONSIDERATIONS, HAS LED TO A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN OUR AID PROGRAM.
