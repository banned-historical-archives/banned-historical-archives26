		<h3>Tor</h3>
		<p><a href="https://www.torproject.org">Tor</a> is an encrypted anonymising network that makes it harder to intercept internet communications, or see where communications are coming from or going to.</p>
		<p>In order to use the WikiLeaks public submission system as detailed above you can download the Tor Browser Bundle, which is a Firefox-like browser available for Windows, Mac OS X and GNU/Linux and pre-configured to connect using the anonymising system Tor.</p>
		<h4>Tails</h4>
		<p>If you are at high risk and you have the capacity to do so, you can also access the submission system through a secure operating system called <a href="https://tails.boum.org">Tails</a>. Tails is an operating system launched from a USB stick or a DVD that aim to leaves no traces when the computer is shut down after use and automatically routes your internet traffic through Tor. Tails will require you to have either a USB stick or a DVD at least 4GB big and a laptop or desktop computer.</p>

		<h3>Tips</h3>
		<p>Our submission system works hard to preserve your anonymity, but we recommend you also take some of your own precautions. Please review these basic guidelines. </p>
		<div>
			<h4>1. Contact us if you have specific problems</h4>
			<p>If you have a very large submission, or a submission with a complex format, or are a high-risk source, please <a href="#submit_help_contact">contact us</a>. In our experience it is always possible to find a custom solution for even the most seemingly difficult situations.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h4>2. What computer to use</h4>
			<p>If the computer you are uploading from could subsequently be audited in an investigation, consider using a computer that is not easily tied to you. Technical users can also use <a href="https://tails.boum.org">Tails</a> to help ensure you do not leave any records of your submission on the computer.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h4>3. Do not talk about your submission to others</h4>
			<p>If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in source protection – it is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This includes other media organisations.</p>
		</div>

	</div>

		<h3>After</h3>

		<div>
			<h4>1. Do not talk about your submission to others</h4>
			<p>If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in source protection – it is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This includes other media organisations.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h4>2. Act normal</h4>
			<p>If you are a high-risk source, avoid saying anything or doing anything after submitting which might promote suspicion. In particular, you should try to stick to your normal routine and behaviour.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h4>3. Remove traces of your submission</h4>
			<p>If you are a high-risk source and the computer you prepared your submission on, or uploaded it from, could subsequently be audited in an investigation, we recommend that you format and dispose of the computer hard drive and any other storage media you used.</p>
			<p>In particular, hard drives retain data after formatting which may be visible to a digital forensics team and flash media (USB sticks, memory cards and SSD drives) retain data even after a secure erasure. If you used flash media to store sensitive data, it is important to destroy the media.</p>
			<p>If you do this and are a high-risk source you should make sure there are no traces of the clean-up, since such traces themselves may draw suspicion.</p>
			<div>
				<h4>4. If you face legal action</h4>
				<p>If a legal action is brought against you as a result of your submission, there are organisations that may help you. The Courage Foundation is an international organisation dedicated to the protection of journalistic sources. You can find more details at <a href="https://www.couragefound.org">https://www.couragefound.org</a>.</p>

		<p>WikiLeaks publishes documents of political or historical importance that are censored or otherwise suppressed. We specialise in strategic global publishing and large archives.</p>
		<p>The following is the address of our secure site where you can anonymously upload your documents to WikiLeaks editors. You can only access this submissions system through Tor. (See our <a href="#submit_help_tor">Tor tab</a> for more information.) We also advise you to read our <a href="#submit_help_tips">tips for sources</a> before submitting.</p>

			<!--<div>
				Copy this address into your Tor browser. Advanced users, if they wish, can also add a further layer of encryption to their submission using <a href="#submit_wlkey">our public PGP key</a>.
			</div>-->
		</div>

		<p>If you cannot use Tor, or your submission is very large, or you have specific requirements, WikiLeaks provides several alternative methods. <a href="#submit_help_contact">Contact us</a> to discuss how to proceed.</p>

1. FOR SUMMARY OF THIS MESSAGE SEE REF B.


2. IN PEKING 2635 WE ANALYZED CHINA'S ECONOMIC

PERFORMANCE DURING THE PAST YEAA AND CONCLUDED
WITH CAUTIOUS OPTIMISM ABOUT PROSPECTS FOR

CONTINUED GRADUAL RESOLUTION OF CHINA'S
STRUCTURAL PROBLEMS AND SPECIFIC BOTTLENECKS

IN THE ECONOMY. IN THIS MESSAGE, WE EXAMINE
CONFIDENTIAL


CONFIDENTIAL


PAGE 02    PEKING 02789 01 OF 04 300347Z


THE FOREIGN TRADE POLICIES OF THE HUA GOVERNMENT.
THESE POLICIES -- MANY OF WHICH WERE ASSOCIATED

WITH CHOU EN-LAI AND THE OBJECT OF SEVERE
POLITICAL ATTTACK IN 1976 -- ARE DESIGNED TO

SUPPORT CHINA'S ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND TO
HASTEN THE MODERNIZATION OF CHINA'S INDUSTRY,
AGRICULTURE, SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY, AND NATIONAL









DEFENSE.


3. THE OCTOBER 1977 &quot;RED FLAG&quot; ARTICLE ON FOREIGN
TRADE BY LI CHIANG, MINISTER OF FOREIGN TRADE, IS

THE HUA GOVERNMENT'S MOST COMPREHENSIVE SUMMATION
AND DISCUSSION OF THE TRADE POLICIES TO BE

FOLLOWED IN COMING YEARS. LI MAKES
CLEAR THAT TRADE IS TO BE CARRIED ON TO MEET THE NEEDS

OF CHINA'S DOMESTIC ECONOMY. HE EMPHASIZES MAO'S
STATEMENT THAT TRADE WILL &quot;FACILITATE THE

DEVELOPMENT OF PRODUCTION AND A FLOURISHING ECONOMY&quot;,
AND ARGUES THAT SUCCESSFUL TRADE WILL &quot;RAISE

THE LEVEL OF PRODUCTION TECHNIQUES, PROMOTE
THE GROWTH OF THE COLLECTIVE ECONOMY, INCREASE

THE INCOMES OF THE COMMUNES, BRIGADES AND THE
MASSES, INCREASE THE ACCUMULATION OF CAPITAL

FOR THE MECHANIZATION OF AGRICULTURE, AND PROMOTE
A FLOURISHING DOMESTIC MARKET&quot;.


4. IN CARRYING OUT FOREIGN TRADE, LI CHIANG
EMPHASIZES THAT CHINA WILL:

--REMAIN BASICALLY SELF-RELIANT: &quot;WE MUST
FOREVER ADHERE TO THE POLICY OF MAINTAINING

INDEPENDENCE, KEEPING THE INITIATIVE IN OUR OWN
HANDS, AND ACHIEVING REGENERATION THROUGH

SELF-RELIANCE.&quot;
CONFIDENTIAL


CONFIDENTIAL


PAGE 03    PEKING 02789 01 OF 04 300347Z


--SELECTIVELY USE IMPORTS OF ADVANCED DESIGN

AND TECHNOLOGY TO SPEED THE DEVELOPMENT OF
CRITICAL SECTORS OF THE ECONOMY: &quot;IF WE REFUSE TO

LEARN THE ADVANCED EXPERIENCES AND ADVANCED
TECHNIQUES OF OTHER COUNTRIES AND INSTEAD

START EVERYTHING FROM SCRATCH, THAT IS BOUND TO
AFFECT THE PACE OF DEVELOPMENT OF SOME OF OUR

INDUSTRIAL TECHNOLOGIES&quot;.
--MOUNT AN EFFORT TO EXPAND THE SUPPLY OF

EXPORT COMMODITIES: &quot;PRODUCTION IS THE
FOUNDATION OF FOREIGN TRADE. ONLY WITH THE

DEVEOPMENT AND PRODUCTION AND AN ABUNDANCE OF
COMMODITIES CAN WE HAVE AN ADEQUATE SUPPLY OF

GOODS FOR EXPORT AND BROADEN OUR EXCHANGES
WITH FOREIGN COUNTRIES&quot;.

--BE MORE FLEXIBLE IN ITS APPROACH TO THE
MARKET AND TRADE PRACTICES: &quot;WE MUST BE GOOD

AT USING DIFFERENT PRODUCTS, TIMES, AND MARKETS
IN IMPORTING AND EXPORTING AND FLEXIBILITY USE ALL

TRADE METHODS UNDER VARIOUS COMPLICATED
CONDITIONS&quot;.
--USE FOREIGN TRADE IN SUPPORT OF FOREIGN










POLICY GOALS: TRADE WILL &quot;ENHANCE FRIENDSHIP
WITH THE PEOPLES OF VARIOUS COUNTRIES AND PROMOTE

THE STRUGGLE AGAINST IMPERIALISM, COLONIALISM
AND HEGEMONISM&quot;.


5. LEST THERE BE ANY DOUBT AS TO THE CONTRIBUTION

FOREIGN TRADE IS TO MAKE TO THE ECONOMY, LI
DECLARES: &quot;ACTIVELY DEVELOPING SOCIALIST
FOREIGN TRADE IS AS JUSTIFIED, MERITORIOUS AND

GLORIOUS AS PRACTICING SOCIALISM IN A BIG WAY ON
OTHER FRONTS&quot;.

6. THE FOREIGN TRADE CORPORATIONS HAVE MOVED IN

RECENT MONTHS TO IMPLEMENT THESE NEWLY ENUNCIATED
TRADE POLICIES. ON THE IMPORT SIDE, WE HAVE SEEN

THIS YEAR LARGE NUMBERS OF BUSINESSMEN FROM
WEST EUROPE, JAPAN AND THE US INVITED TO PEKING
FOR TECHNICAL PRESENTATIONS AND NEGOTIATIONS AND

TO MEET NOT ONLY WITH FOREIGN TRADE CORPORATION
OFFICIALS BUT ALSO WITH CHINESE END-USERS.

THE PRC CORPORATIONS ARE SHOWING EAGERNESS TO
DISCUSS IN DETAIL WITH VISITING GROUPS THE

TECHNOLOGY AVAILABLE AND THE ABILITY OF FOREIGN
EQUIPMENT AND MACHINERY TO SATISFY CHINA'S

REQUIREMENTS. DISCUSSIONS ARE FREQUENTLY
DETAILED AND EXHAUSTIVE, WITH THE CHINESE

INTERESTED NOT ONLY IN THE CAPABILITIES OF THE
PRODUCTS THEMSELVES, BUT IN THE DESIGN AND

KNOW-HOW WHICH GOES INTO THEM. WHILE THE PRC
HAS BEEN INTERESTED IN FOREIGN TECHNOLOGY IN THE PAST,

AND IN PARTICULAR IN THE FIRST HALF OF
THE 1970'S, THE PRESENT SCALE OF ACTIVITY, PARTI-

CULARLY THE NUMBER OF VISITING BUSINESSMEN, IS
PERHAPS GREATER THAN DURING ANY PREVIOUS PERIOD.


7. THE FOREIGN TRADE CORPORATIONS HAVE EXPRESSED
PRIORITY INTEREST IN EQUIPMENT AND MACHINERY

IMPORTS FOR SEVERAL SECTORS. THE MODERNIZATION
OF THE IRON AND STEEL INDUSTRY AND THE TRANSPORT

SECTOR ARE PARTICULAR CONCERN BECAUSE OF
CONSISTENTLY POOR PERFORMANCE. PETROLEUM,

CINCPAC FOR POLAD


PETROCHEMICALS AND COAL HAVE TOP PRIORITY
BECAUSE THERE IS BOTH STRONG DOMESTIC DEMAND

AS WELL AS POTENTIAL FOR LARGE-SCALE EXPORTS
AND A VARIETY OF PRODUCTS FOR THE CRITICALLY

IMPORTANT AGRICULTURAL SECTOR ARE ALSO BEING
IMPORTED - INCLUDING TRACTORS AND LARGE

IRRIGATION SYSTEMS -- ON A TRIAL BASIS TO TEST
THEIR USEFULNESS IN RAISING AGRICULTURAL

PRODUCTION. CHEMICAL FERTILIZERS, INSECTICIDES,
AND HERBICIDES CONTINUE TO BE IMPORTED IN LARGE

QUANTITIES.


8. DESPITE THE ACTIVITY OF THE FOREIGN TRADE
CORPORATIONS, THE NUMBER OF ACTUAL CONTRACTS
BEING SIGNED FOR EQUIPMENT AND MACHINERY PURCHASES

IS STILL LIMITED, AND LARGE CONTRACTS
CONFIDENTIAL


CONFIDENTIAL


PAGE 02    PEKING 02789 02 OF 04 300407Z


PARTICULARLY SO. WHOLE PLANT PURCHASES, WHILE

ENVISIONED TO PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN THE
DEVELOPMENT OF THE ECONOMY, ARE NOT LIKELY TO

RESUME UNTIL WELL INTO 1978. LACK OF APPROVAL









FOR LONG-TERM IMPORT PLANS APPEARS TO BE THE
PRIMARY REASON FOR THIS TREND. FOR THE SHORT-

TERM, THEREFORE, CHINA'S PURCHASES ARE
CONCENTRATED OVERWHELMINGLY ON EQUIPMENT AND

MACHINERY FOR THE MODERNIZATION OF EXISTING
FACILITIES.


IMPLEMENTING THE NEW TRADE POLICIES -- EXPORTS


9. IN ORDER TO PAY FOR ITS EXPANDING IMPORTS,

CHINA'S LEADERS HAVE IDENTIFIED THREE AREAS
IN WHICH TO CONCENTRATE IN ORDER TO IMPROVE

EXPORT PERFORMANCE. THE FIRST IS STRENGTHENING
THE FOREIGN TRADE INFRASTRUCTURE BY IMPROVING

AND STREAMLINING THE ENTIRE EXPORT ORGANIZATION.
THE JULY 29 &quot;PEOPLE'S DAILY&quot; ARTICLE REPORTING

THE FOREIGN TRADE CONFERENCE AND LI CHIANG'S
&quot;RED FLAG&quot; ARTICLE, AS WELL AS PRIVATE COMMENTS

BY PRC OFFICIALS, EMPHASIZE THE NEED FOR BETTER
EXPORT PRODUCTION PLANNING, IMPROVED VARIETY
AND QUALITY OF PRODUCTS, SPEEDIER DELIVERY TO

CUSTOMERS, AND BETTER TRAINING FOR PERSONNEL IN
THE FOREIGN TRADE SECTOR. THE MINISTRY OF FOREIGN

TRADE HAS NOT ENTIRELY IGNORED THIS CALL, ALTHOUGH
THERE HAVE BEEN FEW CONCRETE EXAMPLES OF CHANGE

SO FAR. AS ONE EXAMPLE, HOWEVER, THE FOREIGN TRADE
INSTITUTE HAS CUT BACK ITS ENROLLMENT FROM

1,400 TO 500 IN ORDER TO EMPHASIZE QUALITY OVER
QUANTITY, WHILE ITS CURRICULUM IS BEING EXPANDED

CONFIDENTIAL


CONFIDENTIAL


PAGE 03    PEKING 02789 02 OF 04 300407Z


AND A RIGOROUS EXAMINATION SYSTEM INSTITUTED. IN
ADDITION, A SPECIAL TRAINING PROGRAM FOR TEACHERS

AT THE INSTITUTE HAS BEGUN IN ORDER TO UPGRADE
TEACHING STANDARDS.


10. SECONDLY, CHINA HOPES TO EXPAND EXPORT

OF TRADITIONAL PRODUCTS AND COMMODITIES, ALTHOUGH
SUPPLY PROBLEMS ARE HOLDING BACK A SIGNIFICANT

EXPANSION IN THE SHORT-TERM. THE PRC IS
PROMOTING TEXTILES, LIGHT INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTS,

AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS, NATIVE PRODUCTS, (HERBS,
ESSENTIAL OILS, ETC.), HANDICRAFTS, AND

COMMODITIES SUCH AS CHEMICALS, METALS AND MINERALS.
WHILE THE FACTORIES AND COMMUNIES ARE BEING

EXHORTED TO INCREASE THE SUPPLY OF QUALITY PRODUCTS,
THE FOREIGN TRADE CORPORATIONS ARE SENDING

INCREASING NUMBERS OF GROUPS OVERSEAS TO BECOME
MORE FAMILIAR WITH TRADITIONAL MARKETS AND TO
LOCATE NEW EXPORT POSSIBILITIES. ALSO, PRC










NEGOTIATORS HAVE SHOWN REMARKABLE
WILLINGNESS -- BY RECENT PAST STANDARDS -- TO

CONSIDER THE INDIVIDUAL NEEDS OF THEIR BUYERS AND
TO TAILOR PRODUCTS TO REQUIRED SPECIFICATIONS, IN

CONTRAST TO LAST YEAR'S PREVALENT &quot;TAKE-IT-OR-
LEAVE-IT&quot; ATTITUDE. LONGER TERM SUPPLY CONTRACTS

ARE BEING NEGOTIATED, AND INSPECTION STANDARDS
ARE CLAIMED TO BE MORE RIGOROUSLY OBSERVED.
THESE ACTIONS ARE ALL DESIGNED TO MAKE CHINA'S

PRODUCTS MORE ATTRACTIVE TO FOREIGN BUYERS.


11. CHINA IS ALSO MOVING TO EXPAND PRODUCTION
OF NATURAL RESOURCES FOR EXPORT, IN PARTICULAR

PETROLEUM AND COAL. FOREIGN SPPLIERS OF
PETROLEUM AND MINING EQUIPMENT ARE FINDING AN

UNUSUALLY RECEPTIVE ATTITUDE AMONG FOREIGN
TRADE OFFICIALS TO PROPOSALS FOR EQUIPMENT SALES.

THESE NATURAL RESOURCES HOLD THE BEST PROMISE
OF PROVIDING THE LARGE QUANTITIES OF FOREIGN
EXCHANGE WHICH THE PRC WILL NEED IN THE COMING

YEARS. HOWEVER, THIS IS A LONGER-TERM PROSPECT
AND ONE WHICH IS DEPENDENT NOT ONLY ON SUFFICIENT

EXPORT AVAILABILITIES, BUT ALSO ON SUITABLE FOREIGN
MARKETS AT PRICES ACCEPTABLE TO THE PRC AND ITS

CUSTOMERS.

12. THE NEWLY ENUNCIATED TRADE POLICIES CONTINUE
TO EXCLUDE DIRECT BORROWING IN THE FORM OF

BANK LOANS OR LINES OF CREDIT, BUT OTHER TYPES
OF CREDIT ARRANGEMENTS WILL PLAY AN IMPORTANT

ROLE IN TRADE FINANCING. LONGER-TERM DEFERRED
PAYMENTS -- UP TO TEN YEARS -- MAY BE USED TO

FINANCE LARGE PLANT PURCHASES, WHILE THE BANK OF
CHINA HAS INDICATED THAT IT WILL BE FLEXIBLE

TRADE PROSPECTS


13. CHINA'S TRADE PICTURE FOR 1977 LOOKS VERY
SIMILAR TO THAT OF 1976. EXPORTS TO NON-COMMUNIST

COUNTRIES SHOULD BE UP BETWEEN 5-10 PERCENT FROM
1976 EXPORTS OF $6.0 BILLION WITH NO MAJOR CHANGE

IN THE COMPOSITION OF EXPORTS. EXPORTS TO JAPAN
AND HONG KONG -- WHICH TRADITIONALLY AMOUNT TO

ABOUT 40 PERCENT OF CHINA'S TOTAL EXPORTS -- ARE
UP 13 AND 10 PERCENT RESPECTIVELY FOR THE FIRST

NINE MONTHS OF THE YEAR. THESE INCREASES ARE
OFFSET BY DECLINING SALES TO EC COUNTRIES, WHICH

CONFIDENTIAL

CONFIDENTIAL


PAGE 02    PEKING 02789 03 OF 04 300417Z


FOR THE FIRST 6-9 MONTHS OF 1977 ARE ABOUT 5 PERCENT

BELOW 1976. APPROXIMATELY 60 PERCENT OF CHINA'S
EXPORTS TO NON-COMMUNIST COUNTRIES GO TO JAPAN,

HONG KONG AND THE EC.


14. TOTAL IMPORTS FROM NON-COMMUNIST COUNTRIES
ARE LIKELY TO BE CLOSE TO LAST YEAR'S LEVEL OF

$4.9 BILLIONBN OR POSSIBLY DOWN SOMEWHAT, DEPENDING









ON DELIVERY SCHEDULES OF RECENTLY PURCHASED
PRODUCTS AND COMMODITIES. THE SECOND HALF OF 1977

HAS SEEN A RECOVERY IN PRC IMPORTS FROM THE
DEPRESSED LEVELS OF THE LAST YEAR, SO THAT SECOND

HALF IMPORTS WILL EXCEED THOSE OF THE SAME
PERIOD LAST YEAR. IMPORTS FROM JAPAN FOR THE

FIRST NINE MONTHS ARE
AT VIRTUALLY THE SAME

LEVEL AS THE SAME PERIOD IN 1976, BUT IMPORTS
FROM EC COUNTRIES FOR THE FIRST SIX MONTHS

OF 1977 HAVE BEEN SLASHED BY HALF FROM THE SAME
PERIOD THE PREVIOUS YEAR. HOWEVER, THIS YEAR'S

SUBSTANTIALLY GREATER PURCHASES OF AGRICULTURAL
PRODUCTS -- ABOUT $600 MILLION MORE THIS YEAR--

WILL HELP TO KEEP TOTAL IMPORTS
CLOSE TO LAST YEAR. MAJOR AGRICULTURAL IMPORTS

ARE MORE THAN SEVEN MILLION TONS OF WHEAT
($700 MILLION), 1.3 MILLION TONS OF SUGAR ($200

MILLION), 390,000 TONS OF SOYBEANS AND 150,000
TONS OF SOYBEAN OIL ($165 MILLION), AND 700,000
BALES OF COTTON ($168 MILLION). REASONS FOR THE

HEAVY OUTLAY INCLUDE THE REBUILDING OF STOCKS
DRAWN DOWN IN 1976, FAVORABLE PRICES OF WHEAT,

SOME SHORTFALLS IN THE EARLY WHEAT HARVEST,
AND A DESIRE TO IMPROVE SOMEWHAT THE SUPPLY OF

CONFIDENTIAL


CONFIDENTIAL


PAGE 03    PEKING 02789 03 OF 04 300417Z


AGRICULTURAL COMMODITIES SUCH AS OIL AND OTHER SOY
PRODUCTS TO THE DOMESTIC MARKET.


15. CHINA WILL HAVE ANOTHER TRADE SURPLUS

IN 1977, SUBSTANTIALLY IN EXCESS OF THAT FOR 1976.
WE PROJECT THAT THE SURPLUS WITH NON-COMMUNIST

COUNTRIES WILL BE OVER $1.5 BILLION AND POSSIBLY
CLOSE TO $2 BILLION. THE OUTLOOK FOR 1978

IS FOR CONTINUALLY EXPANDING LEVELS OF TRADE,
WITH INCREASES FOR BOTH EXPORTS AND IMPORTS. THE

RATE OF INCREASE OF IMPORTS WILL EXCEED CONSIDERABLY
THE RATE FOR EXPORTS, THUS CUTTING SHARPLY THIS

YEAR'S HEFTY SURPLUS.


16. TRADE PROSPECTS BEYOND NEXT YEAR DEPENDENT
ON ON A NUMBER OF VARIABLES. MOST IMPORTANT WILL BE

CHINA'S EXPORT PERFORMANCE. AS A FIRST
PRIORITY, THE PRC'S ECONOMIC MANAGERS NEED

SUFFICIENT DOMESTIC PRODUCTION TO GUARANTEE QUANTITY
AND QUALITY OF EXPORT PRODUCTS. THEY WILL FURTHER

NEED TO MAKE SUBSTANTIAL PROGRESS IN THE THREE
AREAS OUTLINED ABOVE: IMPROVING AND REFORMING THE
FOREIGN TRADE BUREAUCRACY, EXPANDING OLD MARKETS










AND FINDING NEW ONES, AND EXPORTING INCREASINGLY
LARGE QUANTITIES OF PETROLEUM COAL AND OTHER

NATURAL RESOURCES. ACCOMPLISHING THESE GOALS WILL
BE A DIFFICULT AND LONG-TERM TASK. POLITICAL AND

ECONOMIC PROBLEMS AFFECTING DOMESTIC PRODUCTION ARE
NOT SUSCEPTIBLE TO EASY SOLUTIONS, AND CHINA'S BASIC

PROBLEMS IN INCREASING EXPORTS ARE REAL AND
DIFFICULT. IMPROVING THE FOREIGN TRADE BUREAUCRACY
IS A MATTER OF CHANGING INGRAINED ATTITUDES

AND BUREAUCRATIC PRACTICES. WE HAVE SEEN
FEW REAL CHANGES SO FAR AND DO NOT EXPECT THAT

THE NEW POLICIES AND DIRECTIVES -- EVEN IF
CONSISTENTLY IMPLEMENTED -- WILL PRODUCE MORE

CONFIDENTIAL


CONFIDENTIAL


PAGE 04   PEKING 02789 03 OF 04 300417Z


THAN MARGINAL RSULTS FOR AT LEAST A YEAR OR MORE.



17. NEITHER WILL IT BE EASY FOR CHINA TO

SIGNIFICANTLY EXPAND THE EXPORT OF PETROLEUM
AND COAL, AN IMPORTANT TASK IF CHINA IS TO EARN
THE FOREIGN EXCHANGE IT NEEDS FOR ITS IMPORT

PROGRAM. WHILE PROSPECTS APPEAR REASONABLY
GOOD FOR THE MEDIUM TERM, THE ACTUAL AMOUNTS

SOLD IN THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS DEPEND ON
SEVERAL UNKNOWNS. RESERVES OF BOTH PETROLEUM

AND COAL ARE LARGE, BUT THE ULTIMATE SIZE OF
ECONOMICALLY RECOVERABLE DEPOSITS IS STILL UNCLEAR.

RAPIDLY EXPANDING DOMESTIC NEEDS WILL CERTAINLY
ABSORB A LARGE PERCENTAGE OF FUTURE PRODUCTION

INCREASES, THUS DECREASING THE AMOUNTS
AVAILBLE FOR EXPORT. FINDING SUITABLE MARKETS

IS ALSO NOT AN EASY TASK. THE PRC APPEARS TO
HAVE DECIDED THAT JAPAN IS ITS BEST POTENTIAL

CUSTOMER, THUS EXPLAINING CHINA'S PARTICULAR
INTEREST OF RECENT MONTHS IN CONCLUDING A LONG-

TERM ECONOMIC AGREEMENT WITH JAPAN. PRC PRICING
DECISIONS, PARTICULARLY FOR PETROLEUM, WILL HAVE

AN IMPORTANT BEARING ON THE SIZE OF THE MARKET.
JAPAN HAS BEEN PRESSING FOR PRICES BELOW

OPEC LEVELS IN ORDER TO COMPENSATE FOR THE HIGH
COST OF HANDLING AND REFINING CHINESE CRUDE.


18. THE INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC SITUATION WILL
ALSO HAVE AN IMPORTANT BEARING ON CHINA'S

EXPORT PERFORMANCE. STRONG GROWTH OF THE
ECONOMIES OF THE WESTERN NATIONS WOULD PROVIDE

LARGER MARKETS FOR PRC PRODUCTS, WHEREAS
SIGNIFICANT DOWNTURNS IN THE WESTERN COUNTRIES

WOULD LEAVE CHINA LITTLE HOPE OF INCREASING
ITS EXPORTS TO DESIRED LEVELS. LOW JAPANESE

TEXTILE PURCHASES THIS YEAR OFFER A CURRENT EXAMPLE.

THE EEC AND THE US WHICH WOULD THREATEN ONE OF THE
PRC'S MOST IMPORTANT EXPORTS.


19. HOW WELL CHINA DOES IN ITS EXPORTS WILL

DETERMINE THE SIZE OF ITS CONTINUING IMPORT PROGRAM.
FOR THE COMING YEAR, THE PRC SHOULD HAVE SUFFICIENT

FOREIGN EXCHANGE RESERVES TO FINANCE A LARGER
IMPORT PROGRAM, GIVEN THE SIZABLE TRADE SURPLUSES

OF 1976 AND 1977. FOR THE LONG-TERM, PROSPECTS
FOR EXPORT EARNINGS ARE LESS CLEAR. CHINA'S ECONOMIC

PLANNERS, GIVEN PRESENT CONDITIONS, ARE LIKELY TO









MAINTAIN THEIR CONSERVATIVE APPROACH TO
ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL MATTERS, LEADING THEM

TO KEEP A ROUGH BALANCE IN THE TRADE ACCOUNT.
IN THEIR VIEW, ONLY INCREASED EXPORTS WILL

ALLOW INCREASED IMPORTS. CONVERSELY, IMPORTS ARE
LIKELY TO BE CUT BACK IF THEY THREATEN TO

OUTSTRIP CHINA'S ABILITY TO FINANCE THEM THROUGH
CURRENT OR RELATIVELY SURE FUTURE EXPORTS. WE

DO NOT SEE THE PRC ACCEPTING LARGE-SCALE CREDITS
FROM ANY SOURCE.


20. THE PRC'S IMPORT NEEDS ARE POTENTIALLY VERY

LARGE,
AND WE EXPECT TO SEE CONTINUING STRONG

INTEREST IN PURCHASES OF ADVANCED EQUIPMENT,
MACHINERY, AND TECHNOLOGY FROM THE WESTERN NATIONS.

MANY OF THESE IMPORTS WILL HAVE A CRITICAL BEARING
ON THE MODERNIZATION PLANS OF CERTAIN SECTORS OF

THE ECONOMY. AGRICULTURAL IMPORTS WILL ALSO
CONTINUE, WITH THE LEVEL FLUCTUATING IN RESPONSE
TO THE SIZE OF CHINA'S HARVESTS AND PRICES ABROAD.

US-CHINA TRADE


21. AS WITH CHINA'S OVERALL TRADE IN 1977, US-CHINA

TRADE FOR THE YEAR IN BOTH QUANTITY AND COMPOSITION
WILL REMAIN ROUGHLY SIMILAR TO 1976. PRC EXPORTS

ARE LIKELY TO INCREASE BETWEEN FIVE AND TEN PERCENT
TO $210-220 MILLION WITH ALL OF THE INCREASE

IN TRADITIONAL CATEGORIES. IMPORTS WILL BE
ROUGHLY EQUAL TO 1976 IMPORTS OF $135 MILLION

ALTHOUGH THAT FIGURE COULD GO SUBSTANTIALLY
HIGHER IF LARGE QUANTITIES OF RECENTLY

PURCHASED POLYESTER STAPLE AND SOYBEAN OIL ARE
SHIPPED THIS YEAR. TOTAL TRADE FOR 1978 SHOULD

INCREASE OVER 1977, WITH PRC IMPORTS INCREASING
MORE RAPIDLY THAN EXPORTS. IMPORTS WILL

MOST LIKELY AT LEAST EQUAL EXPORTS AND COULD GO
SUBSTANTIALLY HIGHER IF THE PRC PURCHASES LARGE

QUANTITIES OF AGRICULTURAL PRODUCGS.


22. AS CHINA'S TOTAL TRADE EXPANDS, IT IS LIKELY
THAT US BUSINESS WILL SHARE IN THE INCREASE.

AMERICAN COMPANIES OFFER A VARIETY OF ADVANCED,
SPECIALIZED EQUIPMENT AND TECHNOLOGY WHICH SHOULD

BE OF IMPORTANCE TO CHINA IN ITS DRIVE TO REALIZE
THE FOUR MODERNIZATIONS. HOWEVER, PRC OFFICIALS
DO NOT HESITATE TO SAY THAAT THERE WILL BE POLITICAL










LIMITS TO TRADE AS LONG AS US-CHINA RELATIONS
REMAIN AS THEY ARE. VICE PREMIER TENG HSIAO-PING

MADE THE CLEAREST STATEMENT WE HAVE HEARD ON THIS
SUBJECT ON OCTOBER 23, 1977, TO THE BOARD DELEGATION

OF THE NATIONAL COMMITTEE FOR US-CHINA RELATIONS:
&quot;IF (OTHER ) COUNTRIES HAVE THE SAME THING THAT THE

US HAS AND WE WANT IT, WE WILL IMPORT FROM THOSE
COUNTRIES WITH WHOM WE HAVE NORMAL DIPLOMATIC

RELATIONS, EVEN IF IT COSTS MORE&quot;. WE HAVE
NOTED SOME RECENT EXCEPTIONS, HOWEVER, AND

CONFIDENTIAL


CONFIDENTIAL


PAGE 04    PEKING 02789 04 OF 04 300440Z


THE PRC WILL NOT LET POLITICS STAND IN THE WAY
OF A PURCHASE OF COMMODITIES IT REALLY NEEDS,

OR EVEN OF A GOOD BUY.

23. ALTHOUGH THE PRC WILL NOT HESITATE TO BUY

ADVANCED US EQUIPMENT AND TECHNOLOGY OR
AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS WHICH IT CANNOT OBTAIN

ELSEWHERE, NEVERTHELESS WE BELIEVE THAT THE US
WILL REMAIN A RESIDUAL SUPPLIER OF CHINA'S NEEDS

EXCEPT IN CERTAIN SPECIALIZED GOODS SUCH AS OIL-
FIELD EQUIPMENT. DESPITE THE PRESENT OPTIMISM

OF SOME US COMPANIES ABOUT FUTURE TRADE PROSPECTS,
WE BELIEVE POLITICAL CONSIDERATIONS WILL CONTINUE

TO BE IMPORTANT TO THE PRC AND THAT THE TOTAL
LEVEL OF US-CHINA TRADE, GIVEN THE PRESENT STATE OF

RELATIONS, WILL REMAIN RELATIVELY MODEST AND
INCREASE ONLY GRADUALLY. EVEN AFTER

NORMALIZATION, WE DO NO EXPECT A RAPID INCREASE
IN TRADE, ALTHOUGH WE EXPECT SOME IMPROVEMENT

IN THE RELATIVE STANDING OF THE US.



24. THE PROSPECT IS FOR A STEADY BUT GRADUAL

EXPANSION OF CHINA' FOREIGN TRADE IN THE NEXT
SEVERAL YEARS, BUT WITH FOREIGN TRADE CONTINUING

TO PLAY ONLY A LIMITED, THOUGH EXTREMELY USEFUL,
ROLE IN CHINA'S OVERALL ECONNOMY. IN QUANTITATIVE

TERMS, TRADE WILL REMAIN RELATIVELY SMALL,
ALTHOUGH MANY IMPORTS WILL HAVE MAJOR SIGNIFICANCE

FOR CERTAIN SECTORS. ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY,
EQUIPMENT, AND MACHINERY FROM ABROAD WILL SPEED

UP CONSIDERABLY WHAT WOULD OTHERWISE HAVE BEEN
A SLOW PACE OF DEVELOPMENT. AGRICULTURAL

CHINA'S ECONOMY FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE WILL

PRC LEADERS HAVE SET CHINA ON A PATH WICH WILL
PERMIT FOREIGN TRADE TO PLAY AN INCREASINGLY

IMPORTANT ROLE IN THE DRIVE TO REACH THE GOALS OF

STRUCTURAL PROBLEMS AND SPECIFIC BOTTLENECKS

IN THE ECONOMY. IN THIS MESSAGE, WE EXAMINE
CONFIDENTIAL


CONFIDENTIAL


PAGE 02    PEKING 02789 01 OF 04 300347Z


THE FOREIGN TRADE POLICIES OF THE HUA GOVERNMENT.
THESE POLICIES -- MANY OF WHICH WERE ASSOCIATED

WITH CHOU EN-LAI AND THE OBJECT OF SEVERE
POLITICAL ATTTACK IN 1976 -- ARE DESIGNED TO

SUPPORT CHINA'S ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND TO
HASTEN THE MODERNIZATION OF CHINA'S INDUSTRY,
AGRICULTURE, SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY, AND NATIONAL









DEFENSE.


3. THE OCTOBER 1977 &quot;RED FLAG&quot; ARTICLE ON FOREIGN
TRADE BY LI CHIANG, MINISTER OF FOREIGN TRADE, IS

THE HUA GOVERNMENT'S MOST COMPREHENSIVE SUMMATION
AND DISCUSSION OF THE TRADE POLICIES TO BE

FOLLOWED IN COMING YEARS. LI MAKES
CLEAR THAT TRADE IS TO BE CARRIED ON TO MEET THE NEEDS

OF CHINA'S DOMESTIC ECONOMY. HE EMPHASIZES MAO'S
STATEMENT THAT TRADE WILL &quot;FACILITATE THE

DEVELOPMENT OF PRODUCTION AND A FLOURISHING ECONOMY&quot;,
AND ARGUES THAT SUCCESSFUL TRADE WILL &quot;RAISE

THE LEVEL OF PRODUCTION TECHNIQUES, PROMOTE
THE GROWTH OF THE COLLECTIVE ECONOMY, INCREASE

THE INCOMES OF THE COMMUNES, BRIGADES AND THE
MASSES, INCREASE THE ACCUMULATION OF CAPITAL

FOR THE MECHANIZATION OF AGRICULTURE, AND PROMOTE
A FLOURISHING DOMESTIC MARKET&quot;.


4. IN CARRYING OUT FOREIGN TRADE, LI CHIANG
EMPHASIZES THAT CHINA WILL:

--REMAIN BASICALLY SELF-RELIANT: &quot;WE MUST
FOREVER ADHERE TO THE POLICY OF MAINTAINING

INDEPENDENCE, KEEPING THE INITIATIVE IN OUR OWN
HANDS, AND ACHIEVING REGENERATION THROUGH

SELF-RELIANCE.&quot;
CONFIDENTIAL


CONFIDENTIAL


PAGE 03    PEKING 02789 01 OF 04 300347Z


--SELECTIVELY USE IMPORTS OF ADVANCED DESIGN

AND TECHNOLOGY TO SPEED THE DEVELOPMENT OF
CRITICAL SECTORS OF THE ECONOMY: &quot;IF WE REFUSE TO

LEARN THE ADVANCED EXPERIENCES AND ADVANCED
TECHNIQUES OF OTHER COUNTRIES AND INSTEAD

START EVERYTHING FROM SCRATCH, THAT IS BOUND TO
AFFECT THE PACE OF DEVELOPMENT OF SOME OF OUR

INDUSTRIAL TECHNOLOGIES&quot;.
--MOUNT AN EFFORT TO EXPAND THE SUPPLY OF

EXPORT COMMODITIES: &quot;PRODUCTION IS THE
FOUNDATION OF FOREIGN TRADE. ONLY WITH THE

DEVEOPMENT AND PRODUCTION AND AN ABUNDANCE OF
COMMODITIES CAN WE HAVE AN ADEQUATE SUPPLY OF

GOODS FOR EXPORT AND BROADEN OUR EXCHANGES
WITH FOREIGN COUNTRIES&quot;.

--BE MORE FLEXIBLE IN ITS APPROACH TO THE
MARKET AND TRADE PRACTICES: &quot;WE MUST BE GOOD

AT USING DIFFERENT PRODUCTS, TIMES, AND MARKETS
IN IMPORTING AND EXPORTING AND FLEXIBILITY USE ALL

TRADE METHODS UNDER VARIOUS COMPLICATED
CONDITIONS&quot;.
--USE FOREIGN TRADE IN SUPPORT OF FOREIGN










POLICY GOALS: TRADE WILL &quot;ENHANCE FRIENDSHIP
WITH THE PEOPLES OF VARIOUS COUNTRIES AND PROMOTE

THE STRUGGLE AGAINST IMPERIALISM, COLONIALISM
AND HEGEMONISM&quot;.


5. LEST THERE BE ANY DOUBT AS TO THE CONTRIBUTION

FOREIGN TRADE IS TO MAKE TO THE ECONOMY, LI
DECLARES: &quot;ACTIVELY DEVELOPING SOCIALIST
FOREIGN TRADE IS AS JUSTIFIED, MERITORIOUS AND

GLORIOUS AS PRACTICING SOCIALISM IN A BIG WAY ON
OTHER FRONTS&quot;.

6. THE FOREIGN TRADE CORPORATIONS HAVE MOVED IN

RECENT MONTHS TO IMPLEMENT THESE NEWLY ENUNCIATED
TRADE POLICIES. ON THE IMPORT SIDE, WE HAVE SEEN

THIS YEAR LARGE NUMBERS OF BUSINESSMEN FROM
WEST EUROPE, JAPAN AND THE US INVITED TO PEKING
FOR TECHNICAL PRESENTATIONS AND NEGOTIATIONS AND

TO MEET NOT ONLY WITH FOREIGN TRADE CORPORATION
OFFICIALS BUT ALSO WITH CHINESE END-USERS.

THE PRC CORPORATIONS ARE SHOWING EAGERNESS TO
DISCUSS IN DETAIL WITH VISITING GROUPS THE

TECHNOLOGY AVAILABLE AND THE ABILITY OF FOREIGN
EQUIPMENT AND MACHINERY TO SATISFY CHINA'S

REQUIREMENTS. DISCUSSIONS ARE FREQUENTLY
DETAILED AND EXHAUSTIVE, WITH THE CHINESE

INTERESTED NOT ONLY IN THE CAPABILITIES OF THE
PRODUCTS THEMSELVES, BUT IN THE DESIGN AND

KNOW-HOW WHICH GOES INTO THEM. WHILE THE PRC
HAS BEEN INTERESTED IN FOREIGN TECHNOLOGY IN THE PAST,

AND IN PARTICULAR IN THE FIRST HALF OF
THE 1970'S, THE PRESENT SCALE OF ACTIVITY, PARTI-

CULARLY THE NUMBER OF VISITING BUSINESSMEN, IS
PERHAPS GREATER THAN DURING ANY PREVIOUS PERIOD.

OF THE IRON AND STEEL INDUSTRY AND THE TRANSPORT

SECTOR ARE PARTICULAR CONCERN BECAUSE OF

PARTICULARLY SO. WHOLE PLANT PURCHASES, WHILE

ENVISIONED TO PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN THE
DEVELOPMENT OF THE ECONOMY, ARE NOT LIKELY TO

RESUME UNTIL WELL INTO 1978. LACK OF APPROVAL









FOR LONG-TERM IMPORT PLANS APPEARS TO BE THE
PRIMARY REASON FOR THIS TREND. FOR THE SHORT-

TERM, THEREFORE, CHINA'S PURCHASES ARE
CONCENTRATED OVERWHELMINGLY ON EQUIPMENT AND

MACHINERY FOR THE MODERNIZATION OF EXISTING
FACILITIES.


IMPLEMENTING THE NEW TRADE POLICIES -- EXPORTS


9. IN ORDER TO PAY FOR ITS EXPANDING IMPORTS,

CHINA'S LEADERS HAVE IDENTIFIED THREE AREAS
IN WHICH TO CONCENTRATE IN ORDER TO IMPROVE

EXPORT PERFORMANCE. THE FIRST IS STRENGTHENING
THE FOREIGN TRADE INFRASTRUCTURE BY IMPROVING

AND STREAMLINING THE ENTIRE EXPORT ORGANIZATION.
THE JULY 29 &quot;PEOPLE'S DAILY&quot; ARTICLE REPORTING

THE FOREIGN TRADE CONFERENCE AND LI CHIANG'S
&quot;RED FLAG&quot; ARTICLE, AS WELL AS PRIVATE COMMENTS

BY PRC OFFICIALS, EMPHASIZE THE NEED FOR BETTER
EXPORT PRODUCTION PLANNING, IMPROVED VARIETY
AND QUALITY OF PRODUCTS, SPEEDIER DELIVERY TO

CUSTOMERS, AND BETTER TRAINING FOR PERSONNEL IN
THE FOREIGN TRADE SECTOR. THE MINISTRY OF FOREIGN

TRADE HAS NOT ENTIRELY IGNORED THIS CALL, ALTHOUGH
THERE HAVE BEEN FEW CONCRETE EXAMPLES OF CHANGE

SO FAR. AS ONE EXAMPLE, HOWEVER, THE FOREIGN TRADE
INSTITUTE HAS CUT BACK ITS ENROLLMENT FROM

1,400 TO 500 IN ORDER TO EMPHASIZE QUALITY OVER
QUANTITY, WHILE ITS CURRICULUM IS BEING EXPANDED

CONFIDENTIAL


CONFIDENTIAL


PAGE 03    PEKING 02789 02 OF 04 300407Z


AND A RIGOROUS EXAMINATION SYSTEM INSTITUTED. IN
ADDITION, A SPECIAL TRAINING PROGRAM FOR TEACHERS

AT THE INSTITUTE HAS BEGUN IN ORDER TO UPGRADE
TEACHING STANDARDS.


10. SECONDLY, CHINA HOPES TO EXPAND EXPORT

OF TRADITIONAL PRODUCTS AND COMMODITIES, ALTHOUGH
SUPPLY PROBLEMS ARE HOLDING BACK A SIGNIFICANT

EXPANSION IN THE SHORT-TERM. THE PRC IS
PROMOTING TEXTILES, LIGHT INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTS,

AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS, NATIVE PRODUCTS, (HERBS,
ESSENTIAL OILS, ETC.), HANDICRAFTS, AND

COMMODITIES SUCH AS CHEMICALS, METALS AND MINERALS.
WHILE THE FACTORIES AND COMMUNIES ARE BEING

EXHORTED TO INCREASE THE SUPPLY OF QUALITY PRODUCTS,
THE FOREIGN TRADE CORPORATIONS ARE SENDING

INCREASING NUMBERS OF GROUPS OVERSEAS TO BECOME
MORE FAMILIAR WITH TRADITIONAL MARKETS AND TO
LOCATE NEW EXPORT POSSIBILITIES. ALSO, PRC










NEGOTIATORS HAVE SHOWN REMARKABLE
WILLINGNESS -- BY RECENT PAST STANDARDS -- TO

CONSIDER THE INDIVIDUAL NEEDS OF THEIR BUYERS AND
TO TAILOR PRODUCTS TO REQUIRED SPECIFICATIONS, IN

CONTRAST TO LAST YEAR'S PREVALENT &quot;TAKE-IT-OR-
LEAVE-IT&quot; ATTITUDE. LONGER TERM SUPPLY CONTRACTS

ARE BEING NEGOTIATED, AND INSPECTION STANDARDS
ARE CLAIMED TO BE MORE RIGOROUSLY OBSERVED.
THESE ACTIONS ARE ALL DESIGNED TO MAKE CHINA'S

PRODUCTS MORE ATTRACTIVE TO FOREIGN BUYERS.


11. CHINA IS ALSO MOVING TO EXPAND PRODUCTION
OF NATURAL RESOURCES FOR EXPORT, IN PARTICULAR

PETROLEUM AND COAL. FOREIGN SPPLIERS OF
PETROLEUM AND MINING EQUIPMENT ARE FINDING AN

UNUSUALLY RECEPTIVE ATTITUDE AMONG FOREIGN
TRADE OFFICIALS TO PROPOSALS FOR EQUIPMENT SALES.

CONFIDENTIAL


CONFIDENTIAL


PAGE 04   PEKING 02789 02 OF 04 300407Z


THESE NATURAL RESOURCES HOLD THE BEST PROMISE
OF PROVIDING THE LARGE QUANTITIES OF FOREIGN
EXCHANGE WHICH THE PRC WILL NEED IN THE COMING

YEARS. HOWEVER, THIS IS A LONGER-TERM PROSPECT
AND ONE WHICH IS DEPENDENT NOT ONLY ON SUFFICIENT

EXPORT AVAILABILITIES, BUT ALSO ON SUITABLE FOREIGN
MARKETS AT PRICES ACCEPTABLE TO THE PRC AND ITS

CUSTOMERS.


CREDIT POLICY


12. THE NEWLY ENUNCIATED TRADE POLICIES CONTINUE
TO EXCLUDE DIRECT BORROWING IN THE FORM OF

BANK LOANS OR LINES OF CREDIT, BUT OTHER TYPES
OF CREDIT ARRANGEMENTS WILL PLAY AN IMPORTANT

ROLE IN TRADE FINANCING. LONGER-TERM DEFERRED
PAYMENTS -- UP TO TEN YEARS -- MAY BE USED TO

FINANCE LARGE PLANT PURCHASES, WHILE THE BANK OF

13. CHINA'S TRADE PICTURE FOR 1977 LOOKS VERY
SIMILAR TO THAT OF 1976. EXPORTS TO NON-COMMUNIST

COUNTRIES SHOULD BE UP BETWEEN 5-10 PERCENT FROM
1976 EXPORTS OF $6.0 BILLION WITH NO MAJOR CHANGE

IN THE COMPOSITION OF EXPORTS. EXPORTS TO JAPAN
AND HONG KONG -- WHICH TRADITIONALLY AMOUNT TO

ABOUT 40 PERCENT OF CHINA'S TOTAL EXPORTS -- ARE
UP 13 AND 10 PERCENT RESPECTIVELY FOR THE FIRST

NINE MONTHS OF THE YEAR. THESE INCREASES ARE
OFFSET BY DECLINING SALES TO EC COUNTRIES, WHICH

PAGE 02    PEKING 02789 03 OF 04 300417Z


FOR THE FIRST 6-9 MONTHS OF 1977 ARE ABOUT 5 PERCENT

BELOW 1976. APPROXIMATELY 60 PERCENT OF CHINA'S
EXPORTS TO NON-COMMUNIST COUNTRIES GO TO JAPAN,

HONG KONG AND THE EC.


14. TOTAL IMPORTS FROM NON-COMMUNIST COUNTRIES
ARE LIKELY TO BE CLOSE TO LAST YEAR'S LEVEL OF

$4.9 BILLIONBN OR POSSIBLY DOWN SOMEWHAT, DEPENDING









ON DELIVERY SCHEDULES OF RECENTLY PURCHASED
PRODUCTS AND COMMODITIES. THE SECOND HALF OF 1977

HAS SEEN A RECOVERY IN PRC IMPORTS FROM THE
DEPRESSED LEVELS OF THE LAST YEAR, SO THAT SECOND

HALF IMPORTS WILL EXCEED THOSE OF THE SAME
PERIOD LAST YEAR. IMPORTS FROM JAPAN FOR THE

FIRST NINE MONTHS ARE
AT VIRTUALLY THE SAME

LEVEL AS THE SAME PERIOD IN 1976, BUT IMPORTS
FROM EC COUNTRIES FOR THE FIRST SIX MONTHS

OF 1977 HAVE BEEN SLASHED BY HALF FROM THE SAME
PERIOD THE PREVIOUS YEAR. HOWEVER, THIS YEAR'S

SUBSTANTIALLY GREATER PURCHASES OF AGRICULTURAL
PRODUCTS -- ABOUT $600 MILLION MORE THIS YEAR--

WILL HELP TO KEEP TOTAL IMPORTS
CLOSE TO LAST YEAR. MAJOR AGRICULTURAL IMPORTS

ARE MORE THAN SEVEN MILLION TONS OF WHEAT
($700 MILLION), 1.3 MILLION TONS OF SUGAR ($200

MILLION), 390,000 TONS OF SOYBEANS AND 150,000
TONS OF SOYBEAN OIL ($165 MILLION), AND 700,000
BALES OF COTTON ($168 MILLION). REASONS FOR THE

HEAVY OUTLAY INCLUDE THE REBUILDING OF STOCKS
DRAWN DOWN IN 1976, FAVORABLE PRICES OF WHEAT,

SOME SHORTFALLS IN THE EARLY WHEAT HARVEST,
AND A DESIRE TO IMPROVE SOMEWHAT THE SUPPLY OF

CONFIDENTIAL

PAGE 03    PEKING 02789 03 OF 04 300417Z


AGRICULTURAL COMMODITIES SUCH AS OIL AND OTHER SOY
PRODUCTS TO THE DOMESTIC MARKET.


15. CHINA WILL HAVE ANOTHER TRADE SURPLUS

IN 1977, SUBSTANTIALLY IN EXCESS OF THAT FOR 1976.
WE PROJECT THAT THE SURPLUS WITH NON-COMMUNIST

COUNTRIES WILL BE OVER $1.5 BILLION AND POSSIBLY
CLOSE TO $2 BILLION. THE OUTLOOK FOR 1978

IS FOR CONTINUALLY EXPANDING LEVELS OF TRADE,
WITH INCREASES FOR BOTH EXPORTS AND IMPORTS. THE

RATE OF INCREASE OF IMPORTS WILL EXCEED CONSIDERABLY
THE RATE FOR EXPORTS, THUS CUTTING SHARPLY THIS

YEAR'S HEFTY SURPLUS.


16. TRADE PROSPECTS BEYOND NEXT YEAR DEPENDENT
ON ON A NUMBER OF VARIABLES. MOST IMPORTANT WILL BE

CHINA'S EXPORT PERFORMANCE. AS A FIRST
PRIORITY, THE PRC'S ECONOMIC MANAGERS NEED

SUFFICIENT DOMESTIC PRODUCTION TO GUARANTEE QUANTITY
AND QUALITY OF EXPORT PRODUCTS. THEY WILL FURTHER

NEED TO MAKE SUBSTANTIAL PROGRESS IN THE THREE
AREAS OUTLINED ABOVE: IMPROVING AND REFORMING THE
FOREIGN TRADE BUREAUCRACY, EXPANDING OLD MARKETS










AND FINDING NEW ONES, AND EXPORTING INCREASINGLY
LARGE QUANTITIES OF PETROLEUM COAL AND OTHER

NATURAL RESOURCES. ACCOMPLISHING THESE GOALS WILL
BE A DIFFICULT AND LONG-TERM TASK. POLITICAL AND

ECONOMIC PROBLEMS AFFECTING DOMESTIC PRODUCTION ARE
NOT SUSCEPTIBLE TO EASY SOLUTIONS, AND CHINA'S BASIC

PROBLEMS IN INCREASING EXPORTS ARE REAL AND
DIFFICULT. IMPROVING THE FOREIGN TRADE BUREAUCRACY
IS A MATTER OF CHANGING INGRAINED ATTITUDES

AND BUREAUCRATIC PRACTICES. WE HAVE SEEN
FEW REAL CHANGES SO FAR AND DO NOT EXPECT THAT

THE NEW POLICIES AND DIRECTIVES -- EVEN IF
CONSISTENTLY IMPLEMENTED -- WILL PRODUCE MORE

CONFIDENTIAL


CONFIDENTIAL


PAGE 04   PEKING 02789 03 OF 04 300417Z


THAN MARGINAL RSULTS FOR AT LEAST A YEAR OR MORE.



17. NEITHER WILL IT BE EASY FOR CHINA TO

SIGNIFICANTLY EXPAND THE EXPORT OF PETROLEUM
AND COAL, AN IMPORTANT TASK IF CHINA IS TO EARN
THE FOREIGN EXCHANGE IT NEEDS FOR ITS IMPORT

PROGRAM. WHILE PROSPECTS APPEAR REASONABLY
GOOD FOR THE MEDIUM TERM, THE ACTUAL AMOUNTS

SOLD IN THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS DEPEND ON
SEVERAL UNKNOWNS. RESERVES OF BOTH PETROLEUM

AND COAL ARE LARGE, BUT THE ULTIMATE SIZE OF
ECONOMICALLY RECOVERABLE DEPOSITS IS STILL UNCLEAR.

RAPIDLY EXPANDING DOMESTIC NEEDS WILL CERTAINLY
ABSORB A LARGE PERCENTAGE OF FUTURE PRODUCTION

INCREASES, THUS DECREASING THE AMOUNTS
AVAILBLE FOR EXPORT. FINDING SUITABLE MARKETS

IS ALSO NOT AN EASY TASK. THE PRC APPEARS TO
HAVE DECIDED THAT JAPAN IS ITS BEST POTENTIAL

CUSTOMER, THUS EXPLAINING CHINA'S PARTICULAR
INTEREST OF RECENT MONTHS IN CONCLUDING A LONG-

TERM ECONOMIC AGREEMENT WITH JAPAN. PRC PRICING
DECISIONS, PARTICULARLY FOR PETROLEUM, WILL HAVE

CINCPAC FOR POLAD


AN IMPORTANT BEARING ON THE SIZE OF THE MARKET.
JAPAN HAS BEEN PRESSING FOR PRICES BELOW

OPEC LEVELS IN ORDER TO COMPENSATE FOR THE HIGH
COST OF HANDLING AND REFINING CHINESE CRUDE.


18. THE INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC SITUATION WILL
ALSO HAVE AN IMPORTANT BEARING ON CHINA'S

EXPORT PERFORMANCE. STRONG GROWTH OF THE
ECONOMIES OF THE WESTERN NATIONS WOULD PROVIDE

LARGER MARKETS FOR PRC PRODUCTS, WHEREAS
SIGNIFICANT DOWNTURNS IN THE WESTERN COUNTRIES

WOULD LEAVE CHINA LITTLE HOPE OF INCREASING
ITS EXPORTS TO DESIRED LEVELS. LOW JAPANESE

TEXTILE PURCHASES THIS YEAR OFFER A CURRENT EXAMPLE.
ANOTHER CLOUD ON THE HORIZON IS THE POSSIBLE

IMPOSITION OF ADDITIONAL TEXTILE QUOTAS IN CANADA,

PAGE 02    PEKING 02789 04 OF 04 300440Z


THE EEC AND THE US WHICH WOULD THREATEN ONE OF THE
PRC'S MOST IMPORTANT EXPORTS.


19. HOW WELL CHINA DOES IN ITS EXPORTS WILL

DETERMINE THE SIZE OF ITS CONTINUING IMPORT PROGRAM.
FOR THE COMING YEAR, THE PRC SHOULD HAVE SUFFICIENT

FOREIGN EXCHANGE RESERVES TO FINANCE A LARGER
IMPORT PROGRAM, GIVEN THE SIZABLE TRADE SURPLUSES

OF 1976 AND 1977. FOR THE LONG-TERM, PROSPECTS
FOR EXPORT EARNINGS ARE LESS CLEAR. CHINA'S ECONOMIC

PLANNERS, GIVEN PRESENT CONDITIONS, ARE LIKELY TO









MAINTAIN THEIR CONSERVATIVE APPROACH TO
ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL MATTERS, LEADING THEM

TO KEEP A ROUGH BALANCE IN THE TRADE ACCOUNT.
IN THEIR VIEW, ONLY INCREASED EXPORTS WILL

ALLOW INCREASED IMPORTS. CONVERSELY, IMPORTS ARE
LIKELY TO BE CUT BACK IF THEY THREATEN TO

OUTSTRIP CHINA'S ABILITY TO FINANCE THEM THROUGH
CURRENT OR RELATIVELY SURE FUTURE EXPORTS. WE

DO NOT SEE THE PRC ACCEPTING LARGE-SCALE CREDITS
FROM ANY SOURCE.


20. THE PRC'S IMPORT NEEDS ARE POTENTIALLY VERY

LARGE,
AND WE EXPECT TO SEE CONTINUING STRONG

INTEREST IN PURCHASES OF ADVANCED EQUIPMENT,
MACHINERY, AND TECHNOLOGY FROM THE WESTERN NATIONS.

MANY OF THESE IMPORTS WILL HAVE A CRITICAL BEARING
ON THE MODERNIZATION PLANS OF CERTAIN SECTORS OF

THE ECONOMY. AGRICULTURAL IMPORTS WILL ALSO
CONTINUE, WITH THE LEVEL FLUCTUATING IN RESPONSE
TO THE SIZE OF CHINA'S HARVESTS AND PRICES ABROAD.

US-CHINA TRADE


21. AS WITH CHINA'S OVERALL TRADE IN 1977, US-CHINA

TRADE FOR THE YEAR IN BOTH QUANTITY AND COMPOSITION
WILL REMAIN ROUGHLY SIMILAR TO 1976. PRC EXPORTS

ARE LIKELY TO INCREASE BETWEEN FIVE AND TEN PERCENT
TO $210-220 MILLION WITH ALL OF THE INCREASE

IN TRADITIONAL CATEGORIES. IMPORTS WILL BE
ROUGHLY EQUAL TO 1976 IMPORTS OF $135 MILLION

ALTHOUGH THAT FIGURE COULD GO SUBSTANTIALLY
HIGHER IF LARGE QUANTITIES OF RECENTLY

PURCHASED POLYESTER STAPLE AND SOYBEAN OIL ARE
SHIPPED THIS YEAR. TOTAL TRADE FOR 1978 SHOULD

INCREASE OVER 1977, WITH PRC IMPORTS INCREASING
MORE RAPIDLY THAN EXPORTS. IMPORTS WILL

MOST LIKELY AT LEAST EQUAL EXPORTS AND COULD GO
SUBSTANTIALLY HIGHER IF THE PRC PURCHASES LARGE

QUANTITIES OF AGRICULTURAL PRODUCGS.


22. AS CHINA'S TOTAL TRADE EXPANDS, IT IS LIKELY
THAT US BUSINESS WILL SHARE IN THE INCREASE.

AMERICAN COMPANIES OFFER A VARIETY OF ADVANCED,
SPECIALIZED EQUIPMENT AND TECHNOLOGY WHICH SHOULD

BE OF IMPORTANCE TO CHINA IN ITS DRIVE TO REALIZE
THE FOUR MODERNIZATIONS. HOWEVER, PRC OFFICIALS
DO NOT HESITATE TO SAY THAAT THERE WILL BE POLITICAL










LIMITS TO TRADE AS LONG AS US-CHINA RELATIONS
REMAIN AS THEY ARE. VICE PREMIER TENG HSIAO-PING

MADE THE CLEAREST STATEMENT WE HAVE HEARD ON THIS
SUBJECT ON OCTOBER 23, 1977, TO THE BOARD DELEGATION

OF THE NATIONAL COMMITTEE FOR US-CHINA RELATIONS:
&quot;IF (OTHER ) COUNTRIES HAVE THE SAME THING THAT THE

US HAS AND WE WANT IT, WE WILL IMPORT FROM THOSE
COUNTRIES WITH WHOM WE HAVE NORMAL DIPLOMATIC

RELATIONS, EVEN IF IT COSTS MORE&quot;. WE HAVE
NOTED SOME RECENT EXCEPTIONS, HOWEVER, AND

CONFIDENTIAL


CONFIDENTIAL


PAGE 04    PEKING 02789 04 OF 04 300440Z


THE PRC WILL NOT LET POLITICS STAND IN THE WAY
OF A PURCHASE OF COMMODITIES IT REALLY NEEDS,

OR EVEN OF A GOOD BUY.

23. ALTHOUGH THE PRC WILL NOT HESITATE TO BUY

ADVANCED US EQUIPMENT AND TECHNOLOGY OR
AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS WHICH IT CANNOT OBTAIN

ELSEWHERE, NEVERTHELESS WE BELIEVE THAT THE US
WILL REMAIN A RESIDUAL SUPPLIER OF CHINA'S NEEDS

EXCEPT IN CERTAIN SPECIALIZED GOODS SUCH AS OIL-
FIELD EQUIPMENT. DESPITE THE PRESENT OPTIMISM

OF SOME US COMPANIES ABOUT FUTURE TRADE PROSPECTS,
WE BELIEVE POLITICAL CONSIDERATIONS WILL CONTINUE

TO BE IMPORTANT TO THE PRC AND THAT THE TOTAL
LEVEL OF US-CHINA TRADE, GIVEN THE PRESENT STATE OF

RELATIONS, WILL REMAIN RELATIVELY MODEST AND
INCREASE ONLY GRADUALLY. EVEN AFTER

NORMALIZATION, WE DO NO EXPECT A RAPID INCREASE
IN TRADE, ALTHOUGH WE EXPECT SOME IMPROVEMENT

IN THE RELATIVE STANDING OF THE US.



24. THE PROSPECT IS FOR A STEADY BUT GRADUAL

EXPANSION OF CHINA' FOREIGN TRADE IN THE NEXT
SEVERAL YEARS, BUT WITH FOREIGN TRADE CONTINUING

TO PLAY ONLY A LIMITED, THOUGH EXTREMELY USEFUL,
ROLE IN CHINA'S OVERALL ECONNOMY. IN QUANTITATIVE

TERMS, TRADE WILL REMAIN RELATIVELY SMALL,
ALTHOUGH MANY IMPORTS WILL HAVE MAJOR SIGNIFICANCE

FOR CERTAIN SECTORS. ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY,
EQUIPMENT, AND MACHINERY FROM ABROAD WILL SPEED

UP CONSIDERABLY WHAT WOULD OTHERWISE HAVE BEEN
A SLOW PACE OF DEVELOPMENT. AGRICULTURAL

IMPORTS WILL MAKE UP REGIONAL SHORTAGES AND RELIEVE
THE ALREADY OVER-BURDENED TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM

OF THE NEED TO CARRY LARGE QUANTITIES OF AGRICULTURAL
COMMODITIES FROM INLAND AREAS. WHILE

CHINA'S ECONOMY FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE WILL
REMAIN BASICALLY SELF-RELIANT AND INWARDLY FOCUSED,

PRC LEADERS HAVE SET CHINA ON A PATH WICH WILL
PERMIT FOREIGN TRADE TO PLAY AN INCREASINGLY

IMPORTANT ROLE IN THE DRIVE TO REACH THE GOALS OF
THE FOUR MODERNIZATIONS.
