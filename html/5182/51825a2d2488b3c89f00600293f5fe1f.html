		<h3>Tor</h3>
		<p><a href="https://www.torproject.org">Tor</a> is an encrypted anonymising network that makes it harder to intercept internet communications, or see where communications are coming from or going to.</p>
		<p>In order to use the WikiLeaks public submission system as detailed above you can download the Tor Browser Bundle, which is a Firefox-like browser available for Windows, Mac OS X and GNU/Linux and pre-configured to connect using the anonymising system Tor.</p>
		<h4>Tails</h4>
		<p>If you are at high risk and you have the capacity to do so, you can also access the submission system through a secure operating system called <a href="https://tails.boum.org">Tails</a>. Tails is an operating system launched from a USB stick or a DVD that aim to leaves no traces when the computer is shut down after use and automatically routes your internet traffic through Tor. Tails will require you to have either a USB stick or a DVD at least 4GB big and a laptop or desktop computer.</p>

		<h3>Tips</h3>
		<p>Our submission system works hard to preserve your anonymity, but we recommend you also take some of your own precautions. Please review these basic guidelines. </p>
		<div>
			<h4>1. Contact us if you have specific problems</h4>
			<p>If you have a very large submission, or a submission with a complex format, or are a high-risk source, please <a href="#submit_help_contact">contact us</a>. In our experience it is always possible to find a custom solution for even the most seemingly difficult situations.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h4>2. What computer to use</h4>
			<p>If the computer you are uploading from could subsequently be audited in an investigation, consider using a computer that is not easily tied to you. Technical users can also use <a href="https://tails.boum.org">Tails</a> to help ensure you do not leave any records of your submission on the computer.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h4>3. Do not talk about your submission to others</h4>
			<p>If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in source protection – it is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This includes other media organisations.</p>
		</div>

	</div>

		<h3>After</h3>

		<div>
			<h4>1. Do not talk about your submission to others</h4>
			<p>If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in source protection – it is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This includes other media organisations.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h4>2. Act normal</h4>
			<p>If you are a high-risk source, avoid saying anything or doing anything after submitting which might promote suspicion. In particular, you should try to stick to your normal routine and behaviour.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h4>3. Remove traces of your submission</h4>
			<p>If you are a high-risk source and the computer you prepared your submission on, or uploaded it from, could subsequently be audited in an investigation, we recommend that you format and dispose of the computer hard drive and any other storage media you used.</p>
			<p>In particular, hard drives retain data after formatting which may be visible to a digital forensics team and flash media (USB sticks, memory cards and SSD drives) retain data even after a secure erasure. If you used flash media to store sensitive data, it is important to destroy the media.</p>
			<p>If you do this and are a high-risk source you should make sure there are no traces of the clean-up, since such traces themselves may draw suspicion.</p>
			<div>
				<h4>4. If you face legal action</h4>
				<p>If a legal action is brought against you as a result of your submission, there are organisations that may help you. The Courage Foundation is an international organisation dedicated to the protection of journalistic sources. You can find more details at <a href="https://www.couragefound.org">https://www.couragefound.org</a>.</p>

		<p>WikiLeaks publishes documents of political or historical importance that are censored or otherwise suppressed. We specialise in strategic global publishing and large archives.</p>
		<p>The following is the address of our secure site where you can anonymously upload your documents to WikiLeaks editors. You can only access this submissions system through Tor. (See our <a href="#submit_help_tor">Tor tab</a> for more information.) We also advise you to read our <a href="#submit_help_tips">tips for sources</a> before submitting.</p>

			<!--<div>
				Copy this address into your Tor browser. Advanced users, if they wish, can also add a further layer of encryption to their submission using <a href="#submit_wlkey">our public PGP key</a>.
			</div>-->
		</div>

		<p>If you cannot use Tor, or your submission is very large, or you have specific requirements, WikiLeaks provides several alternative methods. <a href="#submit_help_contact">Contact us</a> to discuss how to proceed.</p>

TAIPEI JANUARY 13, 1979
AFTER READING PREPARED STATEMENT FORWARDED SEPTEL,
CONGRESSMAN WOLFF INVITED OTHER DELEGATION MEMBERS TO
SPEAK AND THEN INVITED QUESTIONS FROM THE PRESS.
STATEMENTS, QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS FOLLOWS:
I MIGHT SAY THAT YESTERDAY I TOLD THE PRESIDENT THAT MY
SUBCOMMITTEE WOULD BEGIN HEARINGS UPON OUR RETURN TO
WASHINGTON ON THE QUESTION OF THE FUTURE RELATIONS
BETWEEN OUR COUNTRY AND TAIWAN. NOW I SHOULD LIKE
TO PASS TO MY COLLEAGUES FOR ANY STATEMENT THAT THEY
SHOULD LIKE TO MAKE.

CERTAINLY MY STRONG IMPRESSION THAT THIS IS A FREE,
PROSPEROUS COUNTRY. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT NOT ONLY
FOR THE PEOPLE OF THIS COUNTRY BUT FOR THE PEOPLE OF OUR
OWN COUNTRY AND THE PEOPLE OF THE WORLD THAT THIS SOCIETY
CONTINUES TO EXIST AND PRESENT A MODEL OF FREEDOM AND
HIGH REGARD FOR HUMAN RIGHTS FOR THIS WHOLE WORLD. AND
I THINK MANY OF US WILL BE WORKING TO ASSURE THAT THIS

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
ISLAND IS ABLE TO DEFEND ITSELF.
HYDE: THANK YOU, MR. CHAIRMAN. I WANT TO SAY THAT OUR
TRIP HERE HAS BEEN A REWARDING ONE. IT HAS REINFORCED
MY CONVICTION THAT THE REPUBLIC OF CHINA IS AN
INDISPENSABLE FORCE FOR FREEDOM NOT ONLY IN THIS
AREA OF THE PACIFIC BUT IN THE WORLD. I REMEMBER
30 YEARS AGO WHEN THE ADMINISTRATION IN MY COUNTRY VIEWED
MAO TSE-TUNG AND THE COMMUNISTS AS AGRARIAN REFORMERS.
I'M NOT SURE FROM OUR RECENT ACTION THAT WE HAVE
LEARNED A GREAT DEAL IN 30 YEARS. I HOPE WE HAVE.
BUT WE WILL WHEN WE RETURN WORK VERY HARD, AT LEAST THIS
MEMBER WILL, TO SEEK TO PROVIDE THIS NATION WITH THE ARMS
NECESSARY TO DEFEND IT AND INSURE ITS OWN FREEDOM AND
ASSIST US IN MAINTAINING OUR FREEDOM. I AM DISTURBED TO
SEE THAT OUR STATE DEPARTMENT HAS ANNOUNCED THAT THERE WILL
BE NO AGREEMENTS TO BE SIGNED TO PROVIDE ANY NEW
CONTRACTS WITH TAIWAN DURING THE YEAR. WASHINGTON WILL
NOT SIGN ANY NEW WEAPONS CONTRACTS WITH TAIWAN THIS YEAR.
AND THAT ANNOUNCEMENT WAS MADE BECAUSE THE COMMUNIST
CHINESE WISHED IT SO. AND I AM VERY UNHAPPY THAT WE
ARE DISCUSSING AT ALL THE NATURE AND EXTENT OF OUR
DEFENSE ARRANGEMENTS WITH THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA.
I THINK THAT'S GOT TO STOP AND I'M VERY UNHAPPY WITH IT.
AND WILL WORK TO THAT END WHEN WE GET HOME.

DORNAN: IF THE UNITED STATES DOES NOT SUPPLY AFTER THIS
NEXT YEAR THE REPUBLIC OF CHINA WITH THE MOST MODERN
WEAPONS SYSTEMS POSSIBLE, THEN THE DEFENSE OF THIS ISLAND
WOULD BE DRASTICALLY INADEQUATE. I KNOW THE MANPOWER
IN YOUR ARMY ARE THE BEST TRAINED, AND BEST MOTIVATED
SOLDIERS IN THE WORLD. HOWEVER YOUR AIR POWER AND YOUR
NAVAL POWER HERE -- THE MEN AND OFFICERS ASIDE -- THEY
ARE ALSO THE BEST IN THE WORLD -- BUT THE AIR POWER
AND EQUIPMENT AND THE NAVAL EQUIPMENT IS VERY, VERY, VERY
INADEQUATE, RIGHT NOW. WHAT YOU WILL BE GETTING OVER
THE NEXT YEAR IN THE PIPELINE IS NOT SUFFICIENT FOR AN
ADEQUATE DEFENSE OF THIS ISLAND A YEAR FROM NOW.
WHETHER OR NOT AFTER THIS YEAR PASSES -- IN
CONSIDERATION OF WHAT MR. HYDE HAS JUST POINTED OUT,
THAT NO NEW CONTRACTS WILL BE SIGNED -- HOW AFTER A YEAR
OF A FAIT ACCOMPLI SAYING THAT THIS NATION IS AN ENTITY
OR A NON-COUNTRY HOW WE WOULD EVER BEGIN TO NEGOTIATE
NEW ARMS CONTRACTS WITH MODERN EQUIPMENT, I DON'T SEE
HOW THAT WOULD BE POSSIBLE. EVEN WITH THE CONGRESS
TAKING A VIGOROUS LEAD. BUT, THIS CONGRESSMAN WILL TRY.
KELLY: THANK YOU, MR. CHAIRMAN. THE TEN DAYS THAT I SPENT

IN COMMUNIST CHINA AND THE TWO DAYS THAT I'VE SPENT
HERE TALKING WITH TENG HSIAO-PING AND OTHER COMMUNIST
LEADERS AND THE LEADERS HERE ON TAIWAN, THE REPUBLIC OF
CHINA, I FEEL THAT THE REAL DANGER IS THAT THE
ADMINISTRATION'S FAILURE TO PROVIDE FOR GOVERNMENT TO
GOVERNMENT RELATIONS BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND
THE REPUBLIC OF CHINA HAS -- AND ALSO TO PROVIDE ADEQUATE
DEFENSE -- HAS BETRAYED THE INTERESTS OF THE UNITED
STATES IN ITS ABILITY TO DEFEND THE PACIFIC AREA. AND
SINCE THE UNITED STATES IS A PACIFIC NATION, THIS IS A
VERY SERIOUS MATTER TO THE DEFENSE OF THE UNITED STATES.

WOLFF: THANK YOU. WE WILL TRY TO TAKE SOME QUESTIONS
FROM YOU NOW. I HAVE TWO QUESTIONS THAT WERE ADDRESSED
TO ME FROM MR. HSU OF THE CENTRAL NEWS AGENCY.
Q: AFTER MEETING WITH THE GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS AND
LEGISLATORS IN TAIPEI, HOW IS YOUR EVALUATION ON THE
REACTION TOWARD NORMALIZATION OF RELATIONS BETWEEN
WASHINGTON AND PEKING.
WOLFF: I THINK THAT THE MEMBERS HERE HAVE ANSWERED THAT
IN THEIR STATEMENTS, HOWEVER I WILL JUST ADD THAT ALTHOUGH
THEY ARE DISAPPOINTED, THEY STILL LOOK TO THE AMERICAN
PEOPLE AS FRIEND, AND CONTINUE TO COUNT UPON THE
CONGRESS FOR A CONTINUING RELATIONSHIP.

Q: MR. WOLFF, IT SEEMS THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT IN
TAIPEI NOW PLACES HIGH EXPECTATIONS ON THE CONGRESS TO
PLAY A VITAL ROLE IN MAKING NECESSARY LEGISLATION TO
ASSURE ITS FUTURE SECURITY AND CONTINUED SUBSTANTIAL
RELATIONS WITH THE UNITED STATES IN ALL FIELDS. IN
YOUR OPINION HOW FAR WILL THE CONGRESS GO TO MEET TAIPEI'S
UNCLASSIFIED

TAIPEI 00270 02 OF 05 150416Z

EXPECTATIONS?
WOLFF: AS I HAVE INDICATED TO YOU, OUR COMMITTEE WILL
IMMEDIATELY BEGIN HEARINGS ON THIS. THERE ARE ALSO
OTHER FACTORS THAT ARE INVOLVED. THE NEW AGENCY THAT IS
REQUIRED TO BE PASSED IN LEGISLATION THAT WILL HAVE
TO COME BEFORE THE CONGRESS. THE CONGRESS WILL ACT
UPON THIS. IN ADDITION TO THAT IT IS ANTICIPATED THAT
THE TREATIES THAT ARE NOW IN FORCE, THE VARIOUS
AGREEMENTS THAT ARE NOW IN FORCE, WILL BE PLACED IN AN
OMNIBUS BILL AND PRESENTED TO THE CONGRESS. THE
CONGRESS CAN AFFIRM OR DENY THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION
OR CAN ACTUALLY AMEND THIS LEGISLATION. I ANTICIPATE
THAT THE LEGISLATION WILL BE SUBSTANTIALLY AMENDED SO
THAT THE CONGRESS CAN HAVE A VOICE IN THE DETERMINATIONS.
WE DO HAVE IN OUR COUNTRY THE SYSTEM OF CHECKS AND
BALANCES. WE DO HAVE THREE SEPARATE BRANCHES OF
GOVERNMENT. THE ABILITY OF EACH OF OUR BRANCHES OF
GOVERNMENT ARE TO REPRESENT THEIR VARIOUS FUNCTIONS.
THE CONGRESS REPRESENTS THE PEOPLE OF THE UNITED STATES
AS THEIR ELECTED REPRESENTATIVES AND THE EXECUTIVE IS
TO -- AS I LEARNED MY HISTORY -- IS TO CARRY OUT AND
EXECUTE THE LAWS THAT ARE ENACTED BY THE CONGRESS. WE
INTEND TO SEE TO IT THAT THAT PART OF OUR HISTORY AND OUR
TRADITION IS MAINTAINED.
Q: WELL, THE ADMINISTRATION NOW IS STRESSING PUBLICLY
THAT WHAT HAS BEEN DONE HAS BEEN DONE AS FAR AS THE
NORMALIZATION IS CONCERNED. UNDER SUCH KINDS OF
CIRCUMSTANCES, WHAT WILL THE LEAST THING THE CONGRESS
CAN DO? DO YOU THINK YOU CAN DO VERY MUCH TO AT LEAST
REVERSE PART OF THE ADMINISTRATION'S DECISION ON
NORMALIZATION?

TAIPEI 00270 02 OF 05 150416Z

WOLFF: I PERSONALLY DO NOT FEEL THERE CAN BE A REVERSAL
IN NORMALIZATION. MY COLLEAGUES MAY DIFFER WITH ME ON

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
THAT. BUT THE NORMALIZATION WITH THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC
OF CHINA DOES NOT MEAN THAT WE AGREE WITH ITS POLICIES,
THAT WE AGREE WITH ITS IDEOLOGY OR THAT WE ARE IN ANY
OTHER POSITION THAN WE ARE TODAY VIS-A-VIS THE COMMUNIST
SYSTEM. RECOGNITION DOES NOT MEAN AGREEMENT. RECOGNITION
SIMPLY MEANS THAT WE ARE RECOGNIZING ALMOST A BILLION
PEOPLE EXIST ON THE MAINLAND. AND WE ARE FOLLOWING,
OUR ADMINISTRATION IS FOLLOWING OR ATTEMPTING TO FOLLOW
THE SHANGHAI COMMUNIQUE WHICH HAS INDICATED ON BOTH
SIDES OF THE STRAIT THAT THERE IS BUT ONE CHINA.
NOW I BELIEVE THAT CONGRESS WILL HAVE A ROLE IN MAKING
FUTURE DETERMINATIONS AND HOW WE SHALL IMPLEMENT OUR
FUTURE RELATIONS WITH THE PEOPLE OF TAIWAN. I DO NOT
THINK THE CONGRESS WILL REVERSE THE PROCESS AND DERECOGNIZE THE PRC. HOWEVER, I WOULD LIKE MY COLLEAGUES

HYDE: I AGREE COMPLETELY WITH THE CHAIRMAN. I THINK IT'S
A FACT AND THE QUESTION IS WHERE DO WE GO FROM HERE, AND
WHAT OUR RELATIONSHIP SHALL BE WITH THE REPUBLIC OF
CHINA ON TAIWAN AND THAT IS AN AREA WHERE THERE IS SCOPE
FOR CONGRESS TO LEGISLATE AND AS THE CHAIRMAN HAS SAID
WE ARE GOING TO UNDERTAKE THAT.

ALSO EXISTS, OR IF YOU GO AND LOOK OUT THE WINDOW ARE

MOMENT AGO AND IT SEEMED TO ME AS THOUGH THE REPUBLIC
OF CHINA WAS STILL OUTSIDE THE WINDOW, AND I THINK THAT
WHAT HAS BEEN DONE NOW IS JUST AS UNREAL AS ARGUING THAT
THE NATION REPRESENTED BY COMMUNIST CHINA DIDN'T EXIST,
SO THEY ARE BOTH REALITIES AND THE FAILURE TO PROVIDE FOR
GOVERNMENT-TO-GOVERNMENT RELATIONS BETWEEN THE
REPUBLIC OF CHINA AND THE UNITED STATES IN MY JUDGEMENT
JEOPARDIZES THE FREEDOM OF THE REPUBLIC AND THE DEFENSE,
THE WESTERN DEFENSES OF THE UNITED STATES. AND I THINK
THAT'S SERIOUS AND I THINK THERE WAS NO REASON FOR IT,
IT WAS JUST BAD BARGAINING. WE DIDN'T GET A GOOD DEAL.
AND THAT DOES NOT IN ANY WAY ARGUE THAT COMMUNIST CHINA
DOESN'T EXIST. I WAS THERE, I RECOGNIZE IT DOES EXIST.
Q: SIR, IS THERE ANYTHING THAT THE U.S. CONGRESS CAN DO
TO SECURE PEACE IN THE TAIWAN STRAIT BESIDES THE
ADMINISTRATION'S DECISION TO SELL MILITARY EQUIPMENT TO
THIS COUNTRY?
WOLFF: I THINK THE UNITED STATES RECOGNIZES THE
RESPONSIBILITY AGAINST AGGRESSION WHEREVER IT MIGHT OCCUR.

IN FACT, THIS MISSION ABORTED THE TRIP TO HANOI WHICH WE
WERE SUPPOSED TO MAKE. WE DID NOT GO THERE BECAUSE OF THE
AGGRESSION THAT WAS COMMITTED BY VIETNAM AGAINST CAMBODIA.
WE DON'T AGREE WITH CAMBODIA AT ALL. IN FACT, WE DISAGREE WITH CAMBODIA AND ITS POLICIES. HOWEVER, WE BELIEVE
IN THE RULE OF LAW AND WE BELIEVE THAT AGGRESSION HAS NO
PLACE IN OUR SOCIETY AND IF THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA
DECIDES TO IMPRESS THEIR WILL BY FORCE UPON THE PEOPLE OF
THIS COUNTRY, I FOR ONE REGARD IT AS AN AGGRESSION.
Q: WHAT IS YOUR OPINION ON THE QUESTION OF GOVERNMENT-TOGOVERNMENT RELATIONS FOR THE FUTURE BETWEEN TAIWAN AND
THE UNITED STATES? DO YOU THINK THAT IS THE DESIRABLE
BASIS AND DO YOU THINK THAT THERE IS ANY REALISTIC HOPE
THAT CAN BE ATTAINED.

WOLFF: THE ONLY WAY THAT CAN BE DONE IS BY THE AUTHORIZATION AND FINALLY THE APPROPRIATION. AND, THE AUTHORIZATION
FOR SALES TO THE REPUBLIC OF CHINA. I MIGHT SAY THAT THE
COOPERATIVE AGREEMENTS, THE JOINT AGREEMENTS THAT EXIST
TODAY PROVIDE FOR THE CO-PRODUCTION OF AIRCRAFT UNTIL THE
YEAR 1983.
Q: SIR, DO YOU BELIEVE THERE IS ANY SECRET AGREEMENT
BETWEEN PEKING AND WASHINGTON SINCE THE SAME CONDITIONS
COULD HAVE BEEN ACCEPTED BY MR. KISSINGER AND MR. NIXON

THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN -- THEY WERE NOT. I HAVE BEEN TOLD

THIS. HOWEVER, WE WILL HAVE THE VARIOUS PEOPLE FROM THE
ADMINISTRATION BEFORE OUR COMMITTEE IN ORDER TO MAKE A

ABOUT ANY SECRET AGREEMENTS THAT THERE MIGHT BE. I DO NOT

AS PUBLICLY THAT THERE ARE NO SECRET AGREEMENTS THAT HAVE
BEEN MADE.

SECURITY OF THE AREA OF TAIWAN?
WOLFF: CONGRESS DID PASS A RESOLUTION, AN AMENDMENT,

THAT ACTIONS SPEAK AN AWFUL LOT LOUDER THAN THE WORDS.
AND I THINK THAT WE'VE GOT TO SEE DEVELOPMENTS BEFORE

ISLAND IS ABLE TO DEFEND ITSELF.
HYDE: THANK YOU, MR. CHAIRMAN. I WANT TO SAY THAT OUR
TRIP HERE HAS BEEN A REWARDING ONE. IT HAS REINFORCED
MY CONVICTION THAT THE REPUBLIC OF CHINA IS AN
INDISPENSABLE FORCE FOR FREEDOM NOT ONLY IN THIS
AREA OF THE PACIFIC BUT IN THE WORLD. I REMEMBER
30 YEARS AGO WHEN THE ADMINISTRATION IN MY COUNTRY VIEWED
MAO TSE-TUNG AND THE COMMUNISTS AS AGRARIAN REFORMERS.
I'M NOT SURE FROM OUR RECENT ACTION THAT WE HAVE
LEARNED A GREAT DEAL IN 30 YEARS. I HOPE WE HAVE.
BUT WE WILL WHEN WE RETURN WORK VERY HARD, AT LEAST THIS
MEMBER WILL, TO SEEK TO PROVIDE THIS NATION WITH THE ARMS
NECESSARY TO DEFEND IT AND INSURE ITS OWN FREEDOM AND
ASSIST US IN MAINTAINING OUR FREEDOM. I AM DISTURBED TO
SEE THAT OUR STATE DEPARTMENT HAS ANNOUNCED THAT THERE WILL
BE NO AGREEMENTS TO BE SIGNED TO PROVIDE ANY NEW
CONTRACTS WITH TAIWAN DURING THE YEAR. WASHINGTON WILL
NOT SIGN ANY NEW WEAPONS CONTRACTS WITH TAIWAN THIS YEAR.
AND THAT ANNOUNCEMENT WAS MADE BECAUSE THE COMMUNIST
CHINESE WISHED IT SO. AND I AM VERY UNHAPPY THAT WE
ARE DISCUSSING AT ALL THE NATURE AND EXTENT OF OUR
DEFENSE ARRANGEMENTS WITH THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA.
I THINK THAT'S GOT TO STOP AND I'M VERY UNHAPPY WITH IT.
AND WILL WORK TO THAT END WHEN WE GET HOME.

DORNAN: IF THE UNITED STATES DOES NOT SUPPLY AFTER THIS
NEXT YEAR THE REPUBLIC OF CHINA WITH THE MOST MODERN
WEAPONS SYSTEMS POSSIBLE, THEN THE DEFENSE OF THIS ISLAND
WOULD BE DRASTICALLY INADEQUATE. I KNOW THE MANPOWER
IN YOUR ARMY ARE THE BEST TRAINED, AND BEST MOTIVATED
SOLDIERS IN THE WORLD. HOWEVER YOUR AIR POWER AND YOUR
NAVAL POWER HERE -- THE MEN AND OFFICERS ASIDE -- THEY
ARE ALSO THE BEST IN THE WORLD -- BUT THE AIR POWER
AND EQUIPMENT AND THE NAVAL EQUIPMENT IS VERY, VERY, VERY
INADEQUATE, RIGHT NOW. WHAT YOU WILL BE GETTING OVER
THE NEXT YEAR IN THE PIPELINE IS NOT SUFFICIENT FOR AN
ADEQUATE DEFENSE OF THIS ISLAND A YEAR FROM NOW.
WHETHER OR NOT AFTER THIS YEAR PASSES -- IN
CONSIDERATION OF WHAT MR. HYDE HAS JUST POINTED OUT,
THAT NO NEW CONTRACTS WILL BE SIGNED -- HOW AFTER A YEAR
OF A FAIT ACCOMPLI SAYING THAT THIS NATION IS AN ENTITY
OR A NON-COUNTRY HOW WE WOULD EVER BEGIN TO NEGOTIATE
NEW ARMS CONTRACTS WITH MODERN EQUIPMENT, I DON'T SEE
HOW THAT WOULD BE POSSIBLE. EVEN WITH THE CONGRESS
TAKING A VIGOROUS LEAD. BUT, THIS CONGRESSMAN WILL TRY.

TO ME FROM MR. HSU OF THE CENTRAL NEWS AGENCY.
Q: AFTER MEETING WITH THE GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS AND
LEGISLATORS IN TAIPEI, HOW IS YOUR EVALUATION ON THE
REACTION TOWARD NORMALIZATION OF RELATIONS BETWEEN
WASHINGTON AND PEKING.

RELATIONS WITH THE UNITED STATES IN ALL FIELDS. IN
YOUR OPINION HOW FAR WILL THE CONGRESS GO TO MEET TAIPEI'S

EXPECTATIONS?
WOLFF: AS I HAVE INDICATED TO YOU, OUR COMMITTEE WILL
IMMEDIATELY BEGIN HEARINGS ON THIS. THERE ARE ALSO
OTHER FACTORS THAT ARE INVOLVED. THE NEW AGENCY THAT IS
REQUIRED TO BE PASSED IN LEGISLATION THAT WILL HAVE
TO COME BEFORE THE CONGRESS. THE CONGRESS WILL ACT
UPON THIS. IN ADDITION TO THAT IT IS ANTICIPATED THAT
THE TREATIES THAT ARE NOW IN FORCE, THE VARIOUS
AGREEMENTS THAT ARE NOW IN FORCE, WILL BE PLACED IN AN
OMNIBUS BILL AND PRESENTED TO THE CONGRESS. THE
CONGRESS CAN AFFIRM OR DENY THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION
OR CAN ACTUALLY AMEND THIS LEGISLATION. I ANTICIPATE
THAT THE LEGISLATION WILL BE SUBSTANTIALLY AMENDED SO
THAT THE CONGRESS CAN HAVE A VOICE IN THE DETERMINATIONS.
WE DO HAVE IN OUR COUNTRY THE SYSTEM OF CHECKS AND
BALANCES. WE DO HAVE THREE SEPARATE BRANCHES OF
GOVERNMENT. THE ABILITY OF EACH OF OUR BRANCHES OF
GOVERNMENT ARE TO REPRESENT THEIR VARIOUS FUNCTIONS.
THE CONGRESS REPRESENTS THE PEOPLE OF THE UNITED STATES
AS THEIR ELECTED REPRESENTATIVES AND THE EXECUTIVE IS
TO -- AS I LEARNED MY HISTORY -- IS TO CARRY OUT AND
EXECUTE THE LAWS THAT ARE ENACTED BY THE CONGRESS. WE
INTEND TO SEE TO IT THAT THAT PART OF OUR HISTORY AND OUR
TRADITION IS MAINTAINED.
Q: WELL, THE ADMINISTRATION NOW IS STRESSING PUBLICLY
THAT WHAT HAS BEEN DONE HAS BEEN DONE AS FAR AS THE
NORMALIZATION IS CONCERNED. UNDER SUCH KINDS OF
CIRCUMSTANCES, WHAT WILL THE LEAST THING THE CONGRESS
CAN DO? DO YOU THINK YOU CAN DO VERY MUCH TO AT LEAST
REVERSE PART OF THE ADMINISTRATION'S DECISION ON
NORMALIZATION?

THAT. BUT THE NORMALIZATION WITH THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC
OF CHINA DOES NOT MEAN THAT WE AGREE WITH ITS POLICIES,
THAT WE AGREE WITH ITS IDEOLOGY OR THAT WE ARE IN ANY
OTHER POSITION THAN WE ARE TODAY VIS-A-VIS THE COMMUNIST
SYSTEM. RECOGNITION DOES NOT MEAN AGREEMENT. RECOGNITION
SIMPLY MEANS THAT WE ARE RECOGNIZING ALMOST A BILLION
PEOPLE EXIST ON THE MAINLAND. AND WE ARE FOLLOWING,
OUR ADMINISTRATION IS FOLLOWING OR ATTEMPTING TO FOLLOW
THE SHANGHAI COMMUNIQUE WHICH HAS INDICATED ON BOTH
SIDES OF THE STRAIT THAT THERE IS BUT ONE CHINA.
NOW I BELIEVE THAT CONGRESS WILL HAVE A ROLE IN MAKING
FUTURE DETERMINATIONS AND HOW WE SHALL IMPLEMENT OUR
FUTURE RELATIONS WITH THE PEOPLE OF TAIWAN. I DO NOT
THINK THE CONGRESS WILL REVERSE THE PROCESS AND DERECOGNIZE THE PRC. HOWEVER, I WOULD LIKE MY COLLEAGUES

THIS. HOWEVER, WE WILL HAVE THE VARIOUS PEOPLE FROM THE
ADMINISTRATION BEFORE OUR COMMITTEE IN ORDER TO MAKE A
DETERMINATION OF THAT. AND, WE WILL ASK THEM UNDER OATH
ABOUT ANY SECRET AGREEMENTS THAT THERE MIGHT BE. I DO NOT
BELIEVE HOWEVER -- I HAVE BEEN TOLD BOTH PRIVATELY AS WELL
AS PUBLICLY THAT THERE ARE NO SECRET AGREEMENTS THAT HAVE
BEEN MADE.
Q: SIR, HOW MUCH POSSIBILITY DO YOU THINK THAT FOR BOTH
HOUSES TO PASS A JOINT RESOLUTION TO GUARANTEE THE
SECURITY OF THE AREA OF TAIWAN?
WOLFF: CONGRESS DID PASS A RESOLUTION, AN AMENDMENT,
WHICH SAID THAT BEFORE NORMALIZATION WOULD TAKE PLACE THAT
IT WAS THE SENSE OF CONGRESS -- THE HOUSE AND THE SENATE -THAT WE WOULD BE CONSULTED. UNFORTUNATELY, THE CONGRESS
WAS NOT CONSULTED AND THE NORMALIZATION PROCEDURE WAS

CONGRESS WILL BE IN SESSION ON THE FIFTEENTH; AND I TAKE
IT THAT MANY MEMBERS OF CONGRESS WILL STATE THEIR VIEWS
AND WILL ATTEMPT TO DO WHATEVER THEY FEEL IS RIGHT FOR
THE SECURITY INTERESTS OF THIS COUNTRY.
Q: DO YOU SEE THE POSSIBILITY AS RATHER GOOD FOR A JOINT
RESOLUTION IN BOTH HOUSES...?
WOLFF: MY CRYSTAL BALL WAS CRACKED A LONG TIME AGO.
I CAN'T FORECAST.
Q: MR. WOLFF, REFERRING TO YOUR STATEMENT JUST A MOMENT
AGO, DO YOU CONSIDER THAT WHEN MR. TENG HSIAO-PING MADE
A STATEMENT SAYING THAT HE WILL NOT RULE OUT THE POSSIBILITY OF USING FORCE TO TAKE OVER TAIWAN -- THAT KIND OF
STATEMENT IS A SORT OF AN AGGRESSION?
WOLFF: A STATEMENT IS NOT AN AGGRESSION. AND IN FACT,
THE UNITED STATES TOOK EXCEPTION TO THAT IN ITS UNILATERAL
STATEMENT. THE UNITED STATES SAID VERY CLEARLY THAT IT
DOES NOT ACCEPT THE USE OF FORCE IN UNIFYING THE REPUBLIC
OF CHINA AND THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA. WE STAND ON
THAT POSITION.
Q: MR. CHAIRMAN, DO YOU FORESEE A WHOLE LOT OF CAMPAIGN

OF PEACE AND PEACE OFFENSIVE AND UNITED FRONT TACTICS AS
OF JANUARY 29 -- TENG HSIAO-PING'S VISIT TO THE UNITED
STATES? AND, DO YOU PERSONALLY AGREE WITH THE OBJECTIVES
OF PREMIER SUN'S STATEMENT YESTERDAY?
WOLFF: I HAVE READ PREMIER SUN'S STATEMENT. I MUST SAY
THAT ACTIONS SPEAK AN AWFUL LOT LOUDER THAN THE WORDS.
AND I THINK THAT WE'VE GOT TO SEE DEVELOPMENTS BEFORE
WE ACCEPT THE WORDS THAT ARE BEING MOUTHED TODAY. I THINK
THAT IT IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT THAT THE INTENTIONS OF BOTH
THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA AND THE REPUBLIC OF CHINA
CLEARLY INDICATE THEIR PROCEDURES FOR THE FUTURE. A LOT
OF MISTAKES CAN BE RECTIFIED. WE HOPE THAT THERE CAN BE
PEACE MAINTAINED IN THIS AREA. AND WE HOPE THAT THE
PEOPLE OF TAIWAN CAN BE PROTECTED. WE ARE NOT IN THE
POSITION, I FOR ONE WILL SAY THAT I'M NOT IN THE POSITION,
OF OFFERING UP THE PEOPLE OF THE REPUBLIC OF CHINA AS A
SACRIFICE TO ANYONE.
Q: GOING BACK TO THAT QUESTION OF GOVERNMENT-TOGOVERNMENT RELATIONS. WHAT IS YOUR PERSONAL POSITION ON
WHETHER THAT WOULD BE...
WOLFF: I THOUGHT I ANSWERED THAT.
Q: THAT WAS... YOU SAID THAT IT WAS NOT WITHOUT
POSSIBILITY THAT IT MIGHT OCCUR. BUT WHAT IS YOUR...
DO YOU PERSONALLY SUPPORT PUTTING THE RELATIONSHIP
BETWEEN TAIPEI AND WASHINGTON ON THAT BASIS?
WOLFF: I DO BELIEVE THAT WE STILL MAINTAIN A GOVERNMENTTO-GOVERNMENT RELATIONSHIP IN THE FACT THAT WE HAVE A
TREATY NOW -- A MUTUAL DEFENSE TREATY THAT IS IN EXISTENCE
FOR ANOTHER YEAR. I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU WANT TO CALL

Q: MR. WOLFF, AS TRADE INCREASES WITH THE PRC, WHAT KIND
OF ASSURANCES CAN YOU GIVE THE REPUBLIC OF CHINA THAT

NEAL: I JUST... THE SUGGESTION WAS MADE TO US THIS
MORNING BY A GROUP OF BUSINESSMEN LIVING AND WORKING HERE
THAT WE MIGHT WANT TO CONSIDER SOME SORT OF ANTI-BOYCOTT
LEGISLATION AS IT MIGHT APPLY TO THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF
CHINA. I CERTAINLY THINK THAT'S SOMETHING WORTH LOOKING
AT.
Q: THAT IS SOMETHING YOUR COMMITTEE WOULD PROPOSE.

NEW CONTRACTS OF SELLING ARMS TO TAIWAN, THAT IS KIND OF

TALKS ON THE NORMALIZATION PROCEDURE, THAT THE ADMINISTRATION AGREED NOT TO SELL ARMS. THEY DID NOT AGREE TO
STOP WHAT IS KNOWN AS THE PIPELINE. AND MORE THAN SIX
HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF EQUIPMENT IS BEING
SHIPPED TO TAIWAN THIS YEAR. IN ADDITION TO WHICH ALL OF
THE AIRCRAFT THAT ARE ON ORDER WILL BE DELIVERED IN THE
