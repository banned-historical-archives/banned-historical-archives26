		<h3>Tor</h3>
		<p><a href="https://www.torproject.org">Tor</a> is an encrypted anonymising network that makes it harder to intercept internet communications, or see where communications are coming from or going to.</p>
		<p>In order to use the WikiLeaks public submission system as detailed above you can download the Tor Browser Bundle, which is a Firefox-like browser available for Windows, Mac OS X and GNU/Linux and pre-configured to connect using the anonymising system Tor.</p>
		<h4>Tails</h4>
		<p>If you are at high risk and you have the capacity to do so, you can also access the submission system through a secure operating system called <a href="https://tails.boum.org">Tails</a>. Tails is an operating system launched from a USB stick or a DVD that aim to leaves no traces when the computer is shut down after use and automatically routes your internet traffic through Tor. Tails will require you to have either a USB stick or a DVD at least 4GB big and a laptop or desktop computer.</p>

		<h3>Tips</h3>
		<p>Our submission system works hard to preserve your anonymity, but we recommend you also take some of your own precautions. Please review these basic guidelines. </p>
		<div>
			<h4>1. Contact us if you have specific problems</h4>
			<p>If you have a very large submission, or a submission with a complex format, or are a high-risk source, please <a href="#submit_help_contact">contact us</a>. In our experience it is always possible to find a custom solution for even the most seemingly difficult situations.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h4>2. What computer to use</h4>
			<p>If the computer you are uploading from could subsequently be audited in an investigation, consider using a computer that is not easily tied to you. Technical users can also use <a href="https://tails.boum.org">Tails</a> to help ensure you do not leave any records of your submission on the computer.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h4>3. Do not talk about your submission to others</h4>
			<p>If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in source protection – it is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This includes other media organisations.</p>
		</div>

	</div>
</div>

<div id="submit_help_after" class="submit_elem">

			</div>
		</div>

		<h3>After</h3>

		<div>
			<h4>1. Do not talk about your submission to others</h4>
			<p>If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in source protection – it is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This includes other media organisations.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h4>2. Act normal</h4>
			<p>If you are a high-risk source, avoid saying anything or doing anything after submitting which might promote suspicion. In particular, you should try to stick to your normal routine and behaviour.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h4>3. Remove traces of your submission</h4>
			<p>If you are a high-risk source and the computer you prepared your submission on, or uploaded it from, could subsequently be audited in an investigation, we recommend that you format and dispose of the computer hard drive and any other storage media you used.</p>
			<p>In particular, hard drives retain data after formatting which may be visible to a digital forensics team and flash media (USB sticks, memory cards and SSD drives) retain data even after a secure erasure. If you used flash media to store sensitive data, it is important to destroy the media.</p>
			<p>If you do this and are a high-risk source you should make sure there are no traces of the clean-up, since such traces themselves may draw suspicion.</p>
			<div>
				<h4>4. If you face legal action</h4>
				<p>If a legal action is brought against you as a result of your submission, there are organisations that may help you. The Courage Foundation is an international organisation dedicated to the protection of journalistic sources. You can find more details at <a href="https://www.couragefound.org">https://www.couragefound.org</a>.</p>

		<p>WikiLeaks publishes documents of political or historical importance that are censored or otherwise suppressed. We specialise in strategic global publishing and large archives.</p>
		<p>The following is the address of our secure site where you can anonymously upload your documents to WikiLeaks editors. You can only access this submissions system through Tor. (See our <a href="#submit_help_tor">Tor tab</a> for more information.) We also advise you to read our <a href="#submit_help_tips">tips for sources</a> before submitting.</p>

<h1 style="display: none">The Global Intelligence Files</h1>
   <p>On Monday February 27th, 2012, WikiLeaks began publishing <i>The Global Intelligence Files</i>, over five million e-mails from the Texas headquartered  "global intelligence" company Stratfor. The e-mails date between July  2004 and late December 2011. They reveal the inner workings of a company  that fronts as an intelligence publisher, but provides confidential  intelligence services to large corporations, such as Bhopal's Dow  Chemical Co., Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, Raytheon and government  agencies, including the US Department of Homeland Security, the US  Marines and the US Defence Intelligence Agency. The emails show  Stratfor's web of informers, pay-off structure, payment laundering techniques and psychological methods.</p>

&gt; holy month of Ramadan, people's attention is focused on the outcome=20=20<br />

=20<br />
&gt; charges against Pakistani cricket players presently on a visit to=20=20<br />

=20<br />
&gt; renewed spate of suicide explosions and the terrorist attacks has=20=20<br />
&gt; once again started in the country.The firing on Ali Day procession=20=20<br />
&gt; in Karachi, the bomb explosions outside Karbala Gamay Shah in Lahore=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; on the same day, the suicide attack in Mizan Square, Quetta in the=20=20<br />
&gt; Al-Quds day procession, the bomb attack on police party in Peshawar,=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; the suicide attack on the Qadianis' worship place in Mardan, and the=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; suicide bomb attack on a police station in Lakki Marwat Distri ct of=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; Khyber Pakhtoonkhwa, are all parts of a fresh waive of terrorism,=20=20<br />
&gt; which has targeted all provinces of the country one after the other=20=20<br />
&gt; with full intensity.In addition, explosions are also taking place in=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; North and South Waziristan Agencies and other tribal areas, where=20=20<br />
&gt; drone strikes are also taking place almost on daily basis.<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; According to political and military analysts, terrorist incidents in=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; Pakistan are the //fallout// of the situation in Afghanistan, where=20=20<br />
&gt; the troops of over 40 countries, led by the US military -- all of=20=20<br />
&gt; whom equipped to their teeth -- are busy in conflict for the past=20=20<br />
&gt; nine years in the name of operation, //Enduring Freedom//, which=20=20<br />
&gt; they have started since October-November 2001.With each passing day,=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; the efforts of these forces for an enduring freedom are more and=20=20<br />
&gt; more changing into a mere pipedream.<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; At the moment, when the Pakistani people are thinking about the=20=20<br />
&gt; aforementioned incidents, rapid changes are also taking place with=20=20<br />
&gt; regar d to the situation in Afghanistan and its adjacent Pakistani=20=20<br />
&gt; tribal areas.The command of NATO forces in Afghanistan has been=20=20<br />
&gt; shifted from General McChrystal, who has been removed from his=20=20<br />
&gt; office, to Gen David Petraeus, the commander of the coalition forces=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; in Iraq, at a time when President Barack Obama has already announced=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; to begin the withdrawal of US forces from Afghanistan in July,=20=20<br />
&gt; 2011.Now, while a strategy is being evolved for the troop=20=20<br />
&gt; withdrawal, different viewpoints are being reported from different=20=20<br />
&gt; level.Some Western analysts say that the commencement of the US=20=20<br />
&gt; troops' withdrawal from Iraq and the announcement of Obama to start=20=20<br />
&gt; the withdrawal of forces from Afghanistan have further strengthened=20=20<br />
&gt; the Taliban and other resistance forces in Afghanistan.They say that=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; these steps have provided a psychological upper hand to the Taliban,=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; who now believe that the United States cannot stay in Afghanistan=20=20<br />
&gt; for a longer period.These analysts present the intensification in=20=20<br />
&gt; the T aliban attacks during last year and the current year as proof=20=20<br />
&gt; of their assertion.<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; The war, which former US President Bush had started in Afghanistan=20=20<br />
&gt; after the 9/11 incidents is changing into an unpopular war at the=20=20<br />
&gt; public-level in the United States and its allied countries.In=20=20<br />
&gt; addition the billions of dollars expenditures of the war, the human=20=20<br />
&gt; loss caused by this can also not be overlooked.Two thousand and=20=20<br />
&gt; seventy-six soldiers of the United States and 25 coalition partners=20=20<br />
&gt; have so far been killed in the Afghan war.These include 1,283 US and=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; 332 British soldiers.With 151 soldiers, Canada is on the third=20=20<br />
&gt; position in the list.The other countries, whose soldiers have been=20=20<br />
&gt; killed in Afghanistan, include France, Germany, Denmark, Spain,=20=20<br />
&gt; Italy, the Netherlands, the Czech Republic, Portugal, ROK, Belgium,=20=20<br />
&gt; Finland, Lithuania, and New Zealand.The war is rather becoming more=20=20<br />
&gt; and more difficult for these foreign forces with each passing day,=20=20<br />
&gt; which can be assessed from the fact tha t as compared to the last=20=20<br />
&gt; year's figure of 304, the number of the killed soldiers during the=20=20<br />
&gt; first eight months of the current year is 316, which is likely to=20=20<br />
&gt; soar up to a great extent by the end of the year.<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; If we take a look at the loss incurred by Pakistan in this war,=20=20<br />
&gt; which has been started in the name of Enduring Freedom, the war has=20=20<br />
&gt; literally pushed the country to the brink of destruction.If only the=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; human losses are reviewed, official estimates say that more than=20=20<br />
&gt; 31000 precious lives have so far been lost in this war.The people=20=20<br />
&gt; killed include 90 military officers and 237 soldiers while the=20=20<br />
&gt; number of injured officers and soldiers has been stated as=20=20<br />
&gt; 5930.Sources rather say the toll of the killed and injured persons=20=20<br />
&gt; may even be higher than that the aforementioned figures.<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; However, the US seriousness and its 40 coalition partners in the=20=20<br />
&gt; Afghan war can be assessed from the fact that the number of the=20=20<br />
&gt; forces of all these countries in Afghanistan -- a country w ith a=20=20<br />
&gt; land of 547,500 sq. km. and having militant inclination ever since=20=20<br />
&gt; the pre-historic times - is 150,000, which also include officials of=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; subordinate military departments.In most areas, these troops are=20=20<br />
&gt; either at the mercy of the warlords or the insurgents.That is the=20=20<br />
&gt; reason that a scandal of bribing of insurgents by the French Forces=20=20<br />
&gt; had surfaced earlier this year.In addition, in Musa Qala area of=20=20<br />
&gt; Kandahar Province, the British forces had to sign a deal with the=20=20<br />
&gt; insurgents by offering them &quot;incentives.&quot;<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; Contrary to the figure of the coalition forces in Afghanistan, the=20=20<br />
&gt; number of the Pakistani forces in its narrow tribal belt is 180,000,=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; where they have set up 821 checkpoints as against the 12 checkpoints=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; of the US and coalition forces in as much area on the other side of=20=20<br />
&gt; the border where only 10,000 US and coalition forces have been=20=20<br />
&gt; deployed.<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; Despite that, the United States and some of its leading coalition=20=20<br />
&gt; partners are airing statements against Pakistan every now and then,=20=20<br />
&gt; which, also include the recent remarks of US Secretary of Defense=20=20<br />
&gt; Robert Gates and that of British Prime Minister David Cameron in=20=20<br />
&gt; India.<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; Some Pakistani intellectuals, while defending the apologetic=20=20<br />
&gt; behavior of the Pakistani Government toward these statements, argue=20=20<br />
&gt; that as the United States and its coalition partners are extending=20=20<br />
&gt; financial support to Pakistan, the latter is not in a position to=20=20<br />
&gt; give a categorical response to them.However, some prominent Western=20=20<br />
&gt; writers are heard speaking in their private conversations that the=20=20<br />
&gt; United States and its coalition partners depend on Pakistan in the=20=20<br />
&gt; region and their financial assistance with Pakistan is far less than=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; the services, which Islamabad is providing to the United States in=20=20<br />
&gt; particular and to its other allies in general.They say that if the=20=20<br />
&gt; responsible Pakistani officials, who are depending on the United=20=20<br />
&gt; States for their vested interests and power, ever play their cards=20=20<br />
&gt; in their nationa l interest and begin to gaze in the eyes of the US=20=20<br />
&gt; officials they can get more for their country.<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; The significance of this apparently backward region can be assessed=20=20<br />
&gt; from the fact that all declared and undeclared nuclear states of the=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; world have their military or geographic presence here: Three nuclear=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; powers, i.e., Pakistan, India, and China, are located in the region=20=20<br />
&gt; while three others, i.e., France, the United Kingdom, and the United=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; States, have their armies present in Afghanistan.In addition to the=20=20<br />
&gt; seventh nuclear power, Russia, Iran -- which is closer to becoming a=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; nuclear state -- is also present in the vicinity of=20=20<br />
&gt; Afghanistan.Thus, the United States and its coalition partners have=20=20<br />
&gt; very limited options without Pakistan.<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; The mutual cooperation and collaboration between Pakistan and the US-=20<br />
&gt; led collation was also witnessed in Afghanistan during the past=20=20<br />
&gt; century when their coalition dismembered the former Soviet Union in=20=20<br />
&gt; to so many parts that many of today's intellectuals even do not know=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; the names of all these parts.A debate is also continuing whether the=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; disintegration of the Soviet Union had left a positive or negative=20=20<br />
&gt; impact of the global power balance.<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; As for the implications of stating our position in front of the=20=20<br />
&gt; United States in categorical terms, one of its demonstrations was=20=20<br />
&gt; witnessed last week when US Defense Secretary Robert Gates wasted no=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; time in apologizing to Pakistan and softening his country's=20=20<br />
&gt; traditional inflexible stand when a Pakistani military delegation,=20=20<br />
&gt; visiting the United States at the invitation of the US Central=20=20<br />
&gt; Command, cancelled its visit right at the airport in protest against=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; an inappropriate attitude meted out to it by US officials.<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; In addition to pushing billions of dollars in the war, the United=20=20<br />
&gt; States and its allies are also investing a huge amount through the=20=20<br />
&gt; Afghan Government while reports about rampant corruption in the=20=20<br />
&gt; Karzai government and its administrative machinery are al so=20=20<br />
&gt; surfacing every now and then.However, Hamid Karzai, who himself has=20=20<br />
&gt; no control even in Kabul Province, is putting the responsibility for=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; all his ills on Pakistan and instigating the United States and its=20=20<br />
&gt; coalition partners to take action against the country.Karzai fully=20=20<br />
&gt; knows that now when the Afghan war is becoming unpopular in the eyes=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; of people in the United States and the other coalition partners and=20=20<br />
&gt; pressure is mounting on US President Barack Obama to start the=20=20<br />
&gt; troops' pullout from Afghanistan in July 2011.Despite that, he is=20=20<br />
&gt; making efforts to further complicate the situation by expanding the=20=20<br />
&gt; radius of the war to Pakistan and is insisting for strikes inside=20=20<br />
&gt; Pakistan.In fact, he is forgetting that at present, the United=20=20<br />
&gt; States and its allies are also facing stiff resistance in northern=20=20<br />
&gt; provinces of Afghanistan, while neither are those areas bordering=20=20<br />
&gt; Afghanistan and nor is the population of these areas Pashtun=20=20<br />
&gt; dominated.It is interesting to note that despite rejection by the=20=20<br />
&gt; Taliban and other groups, the Karzai government is offering talks to=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; them and on 11 September, the Afghan president even announced=20=20<br />
&gt; formation of a negotiating body in the name of peace council.In=20=20<br />
&gt; addition to prominent political and social personalities, the=20=20<br />
&gt; council will also include clerics, whose names have already been=20=20<br />
&gt; finalized and will be announced after Id-ul-Fitr (festival to mark=20=20<br />
&gt; the end of Ramadan).Not even 24 hours of the announcement had passed=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; since that offer when the Taliban leadership issued a statement=20=20<br />
&gt; saying that they would sabotage the September 18 parliamentary=20=20<br />
&gt; election in Afghanistan.Calling on the Afghan people to boycott the=20=20<br />
&gt; election, Taliban spokesperson Zabihullah Mujahid said that the=20=20<br />
&gt; election was a step from outside the country and it was aimed at=20=20<br />
&gt; strengthening the foreign occupation of the country.He said that the=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; Taliban would make every attempt to sabotage these so-called=20=20<br />
&gt; elections, adding that the Taliban would target the Afghan and the=20=20<br />
&gt; fo reign forces.It was expected that the announcement of the=20=20<br />
&gt; negotiation council by President Hamid Karzai will bring some=20=20<br />
&gt; improvement in the situation, but these expectations have been=20=20<br />
&gt; shattered after the Taliban announcement.That is why Afghan Chief=20=20<br />
&gt; Election Commissioner Nadir Naderi has described the Taliban threat=20=20<br />
&gt; serious saying that the Afghan people fully know that when the=20=20<br />
&gt; Taliban give a threat they also implement the same.In the elections,=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; 249 members of Wolusi Jirga or the lower house of the Afghan=20=20<br />
&gt; parliament will be elected for which 2,500 candidates are in the run.<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; It is interesting to some extent and surprising to a great extent=20=20<br />
&gt; that when the incumbent president, Karzai, is in the process of=20=20<br />
&gt; establishing the negotiation council and he is insisting on=20=20<br />
&gt; political solution to problems, the United States is still=20=20<br />
&gt; pressuring Pakistan to start military operation against militants in=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; North Waziristan.That is why Robert Gates issued a statement during=20=20<br />
&gt; his visit to Kab ul on 9 September saying: &quot;Unfortunately the=20=20<br />
&gt; operation of the Pakistani forces in North Waziristan has been=20=20<br />
&gt; postponed for some time due to the worst-ever floods in the=20=20<br />
&gt; country.However, I believe that the objective can be achieved=20=20<br />
&gt; through cooperation between the international forces in Afghanistan=20=20<br />
&gt; and the Pakistani forces.&quot;His statement clearly shows that the=20=20<br />
&gt; United St ates still insists on launching a grand military operation=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; in North Waziristan Agency, particularly when the weather is cold=20=20<br />
&gt; and the situation unfavorable there.<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; Let alone Hamid Karzai's demand to escalate the war to the Pakistani=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; tribal areas and the demand of the United States to launch an=20=20<br />
&gt; operation in North Waziristan, our rulers have never ever taken the=20=20<br />
&gt; pain to raise the issue of those people with Karzai and his US=20=20<br />
&gt; patrons, who are present in Afghanistan with full protocol and are=20=20<br />
&gt; active in efforts to dismember Balochistan from Pakistan.These=20=20<br />
&gt; separatists have their training camps in Afghan istan and they are=20=20<br />
&gt; being provided with every kind of facilities there.The same is the=20=20<br />
&gt; situation of the United Kingdom, the biggest ally of the United=20=20<br />
&gt; States in the war on terror, whose prime minister is hurling=20=20<br />
&gt; accusations against Pakistan just to please India.However, no=20=20<br />
&gt; Pakistani ruler is taking the courage to ask them as to what=20=20<br />
&gt; relationship they have with those who are trying the disintegrate=20=20<br />
&gt; Pakistan and are raising the slogans of separation of Balochistan.<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; An interesting development taking is that when (non-Baluchi)=20=20<br />
&gt; teachers, lawyers, traders, and other profession people are being=20=20<br />
&gt; expelled from Balochistan, the United States has announced to open=20=20<br />
&gt; its consulate in Quetta.Some analysts, while writing that the facts=20=20<br />
&gt; about Balochistan situation are not coming in full details, express=20=20<br />
&gt; the fear that what is happening on the western borders is only the=20=20<br />
&gt; trailer while the real film is in process in Balochistan, which is=20=20<br />
&gt; adjacent to important countries, like Iran and Afgh anistan and=20=20<br />
&gt; where Gwadar Port is located besides the presence of huge reserves=20=20<br />
&gt; of oil, gas, and natural resources.The province is also of immense=20=20<br />
&gt; geopolitical and strategic importance on account of its proximity=20=20<br />
&gt; with the Gulf states.<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; In addition to the interest of the United States and its coalition=20=20<br />
&gt; partners in the region, the open presence of India in Afghanistan=20=20<br />
&gt; can also not be overlooked.The patrons of Hamid Karzai also wish an=20=20<br />
&gt; effective role for their new partner, India, in this sensitive and=20=20<br />
&gt; unfavorable region.That is why when Pakistani Commerce Minister=20=20<br />
&gt; Makhdoom Amin Fahim was signing the Afghan Transit Trade Agreement=20=20<br />
&gt; with Afghan Finance Minister Anwarul Haq Ahadi in Islamabad on 18=20=20<br />
&gt; July for providing facility for transit trade between Afghanistan=20=20<br />
&gt; and India, the US secretary of state, in addition to Prime Minister=20=20<br />
&gt; Yousuf Raza Gilani, was also shown in the back of the two ministers,=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; rejoicing and clapping her hands more enthusiastically than the real=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; parties, i. e., Afghanistan and Pakistan.It is some thing else that=20=20<br />
&gt; after emergence of a strong public reaction with regard to some=20=20<br />
&gt; clauses of the agreement, Fahim and other Pakistani officials had to=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; change their stand about some &quot;some&quot; details of the agreement.<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; If the situation is reviewed in the backdrop of this changing=20=20<br />
&gt; regional scenario, it will become clear that while reports about the=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; exclusion of the names of some leaders of the Afghan Taliban -- in=20=20<br />
&gt; whose rule their guest Usama Bin Ladin had planned and implemented=20=20<br />
&gt; the 9/11 incidents -- are making rounds and Hamid Karzai, the crony=20=20<br />
&gt; of the United States, is busy forming a council for negotiations=20=20<br />
&gt; with the Taliban, the United States announced on Thursday to include=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; the Pakistani Taliban in the list of the external terrorist outfits.<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; It is a mere coincidence that Qari Hussain, deputy of Hakimullah=20=20<br />
&gt; Mehsud, Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) chief, announced on the=20=20<br />
&gt; same day to target Europe and the United States .<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; As far as the issue of militancy and extremism in the Pakistani=20=20<br />
&gt; tribal areas adjacent to the Afghan border is concerned, if the=20=20<br />
&gt; issue is reviewed in its historic perspective, it will become clear=20=20<br />
&gt; that the Talibanization and the presence of the United States in=20=20<br />
&gt; Afghanistan are not the only factors, which have contributed to this=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; surge.Rather the rampant backwardness in the area, the outdated=20=20<br />
&gt; British system in vogue in this tribal belt, and the sense of=20=20<br />
&gt; deprivation among the youths of the area are also responsible for=20=20<br />
&gt; this situation.Under the law imposed by the British Empire, the=20=20<br />
&gt; local administration in the tribal agencies enjoyed powers, like=20=20<br />
&gt; kings.The progress and development of these areas had totally been=20=20<br />
&gt; overlooked and the meager funds specified for the areas had never=20=20<br />
&gt; been properly used.The decisions of the political administrations,=20=20<br />
&gt; in which unfettered powers had been vested, had been rendered beyond=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; the scope of the country's courts.In this situation, the iss ue of=20=20<br />
&gt; Talibanization or militancy only acted as a catalyst to exacerbate=20=20<br />
&gt; the situation for which favorable situation already existed in the=20=20<br />
&gt; shape of the simple-mindedness of the local people, their attachment=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; with religion, the lengthy Afghan war, and the links between the=20=20<br />
&gt; Afghan Taliban and the local tribal fighters.Besides, when, during=20=20<br />
&gt; their invasion of Afghanistan in October 2001, the United States and=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; the coalition forces recognized the Northern Alliance as the only=20=20<br />
&gt; force in Afghanistan and subjected the eastern and southern parts of=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; Afghanistan to the shelling of B-52 aircraft, it aroused resistance=20=20<br />
&gt; against the United States and its allies in the Pashtun-dominated=20=20<br />
&gt; areas and thus the people of these tribal areas also shared the pain=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; of the Afghan Pashtuns.It is because people on both sides of the=20=20<br />
&gt; border, in addition to their mutual links of language, faith,=20=20<br />
&gt; geography, culture, and traditions, also share common tribes.All=20=20<br />
&gt; these factors should not be overlooked in any rea listic analysis of=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; the situation.<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; In Pakistan, where the suicide explosions and terrorist attacks have=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; caused heavy huge human and material loses, the US drone strikes=20=20<br />
&gt; have also, in addition targeting the &quot;desired&quot; objectives, caused=20=20<br />
&gt; human losses to civilians.These attacks are, in no way, creating=20=20<br />
&gt; good sentiments among people of these sensitive along the Afghan=20=20<br />
&gt; border.<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; Similarly, many groups active in Pakistan, are presenting the=20=20<br />
&gt; presence of the US and coalition forces in Afghanistan and the=20=20<br />
&gt; continuation of drone strikes as justification for their=20=20<br />
&gt; activities.Therefore, steps, like the offer of President Karzai to=20=20<br />
&gt; the Taliban -- who are fighting against the United States in=20=20<br />
&gt; Afghanistan -- for a political solution and the announcement of=20=20<br />
&gt; President Obama to begin the withdrawal of the US forces from=20=20<br />
&gt; Afghanistan in July 2011, will have to be adopted so to seek an=20=20<br />
&gt; inclusive solution to this serious issue of this sensitive region.It=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; is because the continuat ion of events clearly indicates that the=20=20<br />
&gt; collective peace and security of the region depends on the regional=20=20<br />
&gt; situation.If any one believes that by presenting a way of=20=20<br />
&gt; negotiation and political solution, he will be able to find=20=20<br />
&gt; facilities for himself, or by ignoring the real //players// and=20=20<br />
&gt; natural //actors// in the region, the gulf created by the US pullout=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; from Afghanistan could be filled with India or some other country,=20=20<br />
&gt; it is just his misconception.<br />

&gt; phenomenon of Islamophobia and hard conservatism is coincidental or=20=20<br />
&gt; self contained.The figure of the Florida pastor threatening to burn=20=20<br />
&gt; the Koran &quot;transcends&quot; his circle.Under the &quot;false assumption&quot; that=20=20<br />
&gt; there is a link between Islam and the 11-S attacks, his case=20=20<br />
&gt; illustrates with &quot;alarming clarity&quot; what is appearing on the US=20=20<br />
&gt; horizon.Actually, Jones is linked to an &quot;extended fundamentalist=20=20<br />
&gt; movement,&quot; whose ideology has been taking over the Republican Party=20=20<br />
&gt; since the 1980s, and to associated groups, which embody the extreme=20=20<br />
&gt; US right.The so-called Tea Party is an example of that trend, which,=20=<br />
=20<br />

&gt;<br />
&gt; - Buenos Aires La Nacion's economic columnist Nestor O. Scibona=20=20<br />
&gt; writes on 12 September that the &quot;little machine&quot; to emit pesos=20=20<br />
&gt; without backing has returned in the recent extension of the monetary=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; program by the Central Bank (BCRA).The president's specific backing=20=20<br />
&gt; of that decision makes the monetary authority an addendum of the=20=20<br />
&gt; Executive Branch's again and the principal source of financing for=20=20<br />
&gt; the public sector.Its basic ingredient authorizes the transfer to=20=20<br />
&gt; the Treasury of 20 billion pesos ($5.07 billion) of BCRA &quot;utilities&quot;=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; obtained last year from reserves (now $50.6 billion) and public=20=20<br />
&gt; bonds.This point is worth considering: if the BCRA has $1,000 at 3=20=20<br />
&gt; pesos per dollar, it registers 3,000 pesos on its books; but if the=20=20<br />
&gt; exchange rate was raised to 4 pesos, it would register 4 ,000=20=20<br />
&gt; pesos.That difference of 1,000 pesos is what is being emitted,=20=20<br />
&gt; although the amount of dollars remains unchanged.That is how the=20=20<br />
&gt; famous &quot;little machine&quot; is working now.In Argentina, this has always=20=<br />

&gt; The status of women in Afghanistan was the worst right after the=20=20<br />
&gt; Taliban regime.But after the power of investment and the energy of=20=20<br />
&gt; the international community and the United Nations, it has become=20=20<br />
&gt; second worse in the world.So it is better than in the Taliban's time=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; but it is still a matter of concern.About 70 per cent of the=20=20<br />
&gt; population in Afghanistan is facing extreme poverty.This extreme=20=20<br />
&gt; poverty in Afghanistan has a female face because of inadequate=20=20<br />
&gt; access to economic opportunities and economic resources for women.=20=20<br />
&gt; What about education of women? Afghanistan's population is=20=20<br />
&gt; approximately 30 million as in the nationwide census and half of=20=20<br />
&gt; them are women and girls.About 89 per cent of the vast majority of=20=20<br />
&gt; women in the country is illiterate; of this figure, 80 per cent=20=20<br />
&gt; lives in the rural areas.Illiteracy is mostly in the rural=20=20<br />
&gt; areas.What little literacy and education that we have for women is=20=20<br />
&gt; concentrated particularly in the cities and the capital. Should=20=20<br />
&gt; women be brough t into the peace process? Sure.They are the real=20=20<br />
&gt; peacemakers; they are the actual messengers of peace. Why have women=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; been kept away from the peace process? It's because in Afghanistan,=20=20<br />
&gt; power, locally, most often belongs to the extremist groups.They=20=20<br />
&gt; don't want women to be in the mainstream peace process and be=20=20<br />
&gt; participative, empowered and benefit from the process.They want=20=20<br />
&gt; women to be at home and obey the male members of their families. In=20=20<br />
&gt; that case should the 'good Taliban' be brought into the mainstream=20=20<br />
&gt; governance? Well, names and titles are given to help these groups to=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; be engaged in power otherwise we all know the Taliban when they were=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; ruling Afghanistan; we all know their ideology, their vision and=20=20<br />
&gt; their mission, and we all know what they will do once they are again=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; in power; we know they don't want women to participate outside their=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; own life. Do you think Afghanistan has hit rock-bottom since=20=20<br />
&gt; international humanitarian organisations are also feeling the=20=20<br />
&gt; threat? Target ing international groups means that the Taliban wants=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; to create fear in international circles in Afghanistan; to frighten=20=20<br />
&gt; them so that they leave Afghanistan because the presence of=20=20<br />
&gt; international organisations helps to make Afghanistan empowered as a=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; whole and come out of the current crises.But the enemies of=20=20<br />
&gt; Afghanistan do not want that and so the international groups are=20=20<br />
&gt; being targeted. So has it hit the worst situation? Afghanistan has=20=20<br />
&gt; reached a blind point; it cannot move and that is why the=20=20<br />
&gt; international community is speaking with the Taliban to bribe the=20=20<br />
&gt; Taliban with political power and engage it in the political=20=20<br />
&gt; processes and stop the killings.In a way they are placing=20=20<br />
&gt; Afghanistan in the hands of criminals.I do not know why the=20=20<br />
&gt; international community or even the U.N. trusts the Taliban.The=20=20<br />
&gt; Taliban had (ruled) Afghanistan and threatened the security of the=20=20<br />
&gt; world.The international community wants to make the same mistake=20=20<br />
&gt; again. Do you think donor agencies should change their strategy?=20=20<br />
&gt; Donor agencies should stop all negotiations with the Taliban.They=20=20<br />
&gt; should be disarmed through other mechanisms and removed from=20=20<br />
&gt; Afghanistan, and that's what was decided in Bonn.The Bonn Agreement=20=20<br />
&gt; should be implemented. How? Militarily? There are many different=20=20<br />
&gt; ways (to tackle) things in the Afghanist an context.Why did they=20=20<br />
&gt; remove the Taliban from the capital but leave them to stay on the=20=20<br />
&gt; border and provinces?Why didn't they get rid of this headache from=20=20<br />
&gt; Afghanistan at the beginning?That by itself is a question.Why did=20=20<br />
&gt; they remove the Taliban from the north and central parts of the=20=20<br />
&gt; country but not from the southern part?This is the question. What=20=20<br />
&gt; about the social movement in Afghanistan? After the international=20=20<br />
&gt; community came in, a lot of funds poured in and many organisations=20=20<br />
&gt; were formed to work for human rights, women rights, etc.But these=20=20<br />
&gt; are mostly donor driven to implement the donors' interests, plans=20=20<br />
&gt; and strategies.Besides, corruption was never to this extent in the=20=20<br />
&gt; country, security is getting worse day by day, human rights and=20=20<br />
&gt; women's rights are slipping back, and extremism has been an issue in=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; Afghanistan.All this is affecting the social movement in=20=20<br />
&gt; Afghanistan.Had the Bonn Agreement been implemented successfully and=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; completely on time, it wouldn't have reached this situation. Who do=20=20<br />
&gt; you hold responsible for this? I think when the power structure was=20=20<br />
&gt; to be formed in Afghanistan, the U.S.' attention was drawn to the=20=20<br />
&gt; Iraq war and by the time they were settled with the Iraq issue, a=20=20<br />
&gt; power structure had already been established in Afghanistan.So they=20=20<br />
&gt; (the U.S.) left it by itself.So those who were stronger got a better=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; position in Afghanistan.And who was stronger?The extremist groups.=20=20<br />
&gt; How do you see India's role in Afghanistan? I think India knows the=20=20<br />
&gt; region very well and in the context of Afghanistan, India can have a=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; greater role than what it had so far.If India can play a role in=20=20<br />
&gt; international politics with its share of a ssistance for peace and=20=20<br />
&gt; the reconstruction of Afghanistan, it is good for all -- India,=20=20<br />
&gt; Afghanistan, the region and the whole world.<br />

&gt; &quot;Lithuania's Foreign Minister Criticizes Bids To Urgently Grant=20=20<br />
&gt; Preferential Trade Status to Pakistan&quot; -- BNS headline - BNS<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; Monday September 13, 2010 07:10:58 GMT<br />
&gt; Azubalis stated the critical remarks at an informal meeting of EU=20=20<br />
&gt; foreign ministers that took place in Brussels on Friday (10=20=20<br />
&gt; September) and Saturday and discussed the situation in Pakistan=20=20<br />
&gt; after the recent flooding, assistance to the country and plans for=20=20<br />
&gt; long-term cooperation between the EU and Pakistan, the Foreign=20=20<br />
&gt; Ministry said.<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; At the meeting, the Lithuanian diplomacy chief underlined the=20=20<br />
&gt; importance of providing further humanitarian assistance to Pakistan=20=20<br />
&gt; and the need to prepare a plan for EU's withdrawal from the country=20=20<br />
&gt; in five years.<br />
&gt; Lithuania has sent 50,000 litas (EUR 14,500) worth of humanitarian=20=20<br />
&gt; aid, namely, 10 tents and 10 heaters, to flood-ridden Pakistan.<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; In the discussion on trade cooperation with Pakistan, Azubalis gave=20=20<br />
&gt; a critical view of the bids made by some EU nations to immediately=20=20<br />
&gt; grant the country the preferential trade status, reads the press=20=20<br />
&gt; release.<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; &quot;It is not an instrument of humanitarian aid. Pakistan so far falls=20=20<br />
&gt; short of the objective criteria for the status, and hasty revision=20=20<br />
&gt; of the criteria may cause damage to industry of EU countries,=20=20<br />
&gt; including Lithuania, as well as have negative effects upon EU trade=20=20<br />
&gt; relations with some underdeveloped nations,&quot; said the Lithuanian=20=20<br />
&gt; minister.<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; On the eve of the European Council, foreign ministers also discussed=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; one of the main issues on the council's agenda -- EU's relations=20=20<br />
&gt; with strategic partners, for instance, China, India and Brazil. The=20=20<br />
&gt; ministers also spoke about the enhancement of the influence and=20=20<br />
&gt; visibility of the European Union as a global player, and the=20=20<br />
&gt; necessary resources of EU foreign policy.<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; Azubalis called for clearer definition of EU priorities in the ties=20=20<br />
&gt; with strategic partners. In his opinion, it is vital to apply the=20=20<br />
&gt; new instruments in EU's foreign relations after the enactment of the=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; Lisbon Treaty, observe a unified EU position, seek closer=20=20<br />
&gt; cooperation with the abovementioned states on global and mutual=20=20<br />
&gt; matters while staying loyal to the core value principles of the EU.<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; &quot;Energy and regional security should be among the key EU priorities=20=20<br />
&gt; in relations with strategic partners,&quot; said the Lithuanian diplomacy=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; chief.<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; At the meeting, EU foreign ministers exchanged opinions on=20=20<br />
&gt; improvement of organization of work of the European Affairs Council.=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; Azubalis emphasized the need to plan the council's agendas in=20=20<br />
&gt; advance for a longer term, for instance, for six months in the light=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; of the strategic direction and events around the globe.<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; Anothe r issue addressed at the meeting was improvement of EU=20=20<br />
&gt; cooperation with Turkey. Lithuania's Azubalis said that Turkey's=20=20<br />
&gt; active participation was vital in ensuring stability in South=20=20<br />
&gt; Caucasus, Western Balkans, Afghanistan and other regions, as well as=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; gave a green light to development of new mechanisms for cooperation=20=20<br />
&gt; with Turkey.<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; &quot;At the same time, Turkey should be encouraged to continue=20=20<br />
&gt; implementing reforms related with EU membership negotiations, and=20=20<br />
&gt; all negotiating chapters that are ready in technical terms should be=20=<br />

&gt; Palashbari-Ghoraghat hilly routes of Gaibandha=20=20<br />
&gt; District.Particularity, the Indian goods have flooded the market in=20=20<br />
&gt; the run up to the Id al-Fitr festival.Most of the smuggled items=20=20<br />
&gt; comprise saris, lungis (clothes wrapped around the lower half of the=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; body), fabrics, cosmetics, narcotics, spices, fire crackers, spare=20=20<br />
&gt; parts of bikes, and chemicals.<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; Allegations are rife that the police have leased out these two=20=20<br />
&gt; routes at a rate of 700,000 takas (Tk) per month.The money coming=20=20<br />
&gt; from the lease is being distributed among the policemen, leaders of=20=20<br />
&gt; different political parties, and so-called journalists.<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; Lieutenant Colonel Akramuzzaman, commander o f the 40 Rifles=20=20<br />
&gt; Battalion of Bangladesh Rifles (BDR) based at Phulbari of Dinajpur=20=20<br />
&gt; District, told the Prothom Alo on 7 September that the main=20=20<br />
&gt; smuggling drives were continuing along a 5-km stretch of the border=20=20<br />
&gt; to the south of the hilly checkpoint.He said that a huge syndicate=20=20<br />
&gt; was controlling the smuggling drives there.According to him, this=20=20<br />
&gt; syndicate was behind the smuggling of Indian goods to the country.He=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; said that concerted efforts of all types were necessary to curb=20=20<br />
&gt; smuggling and that it was not possible for the BDR to do the job=20=20<br />
&gt; alone.<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; Gaibandha Police Superintendent Mohammad Shahadat Hossain has also=20=20<br />
&gt; admitted that Indian goods were smuggled into the district through=20=20<br />
&gt; the aforementioned two routes.He said that the police were launching=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; regular drives to seize the smuggled goods.He claimed that the=20=20<br />
&gt; allegation of using special police token for conducting smuggling=20=20<br />
&gt; was not correct.He termed the allegation of leasing out the routes=20=20<br />
&gt; by the police for smuggling to be baseless and said that the=20=20<br />
&gt; distribution of lease money among the police was also false.He said=20=20<br />
&gt; that there were no proofs regarding these allegations.<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; It has been known after inquest that three individuals, having the=20=20<br />
&gt; letters M, A, and R in their nicknames, are controlling the hilly=20=20<br />
&gt; Gobindaganj route.All of them reportedly are active leaders and=20=20<br />
&gt; workers of the ruling party.The monthly lease money of this route is=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; Tk 500,000.In addition, the Palashbari-Ghoraghat hilly route is run=20=20<br />
&gt; by an influential ruling party member carrying the letter M.M. with=20=20<br />
&gt; his name.The monthly lease money of this route is Tk 200,000.<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; The people carrying Indian items reportedly use special tokens.The=20=20<br />
&gt; tokens bear symbols of different animals, birds, and plants.They=20=20<br />
&gt; bear symbols of parrots, tigers, deer, and water lily.Smuggled goods=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; are brought deep into the country from the frontier by tempos,=20=20<br />
&gt; bicycles, and vans using these tokens.Goods are seized from those=20=20<br />
&gt; people who cannot show the toke ns.More than 1,000 people of two=20=20<br />
&gt; subdistricts are involved with the smuggling directly or indirectly.<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; It has been known after inquest that theses smuggled goods are=20=20<br />
&gt; entering the country through these routes are offloaded at Kaiaganj,=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; Chashakpara, Guhatipara and Gumaniganj Villages under the=20=20<br />
&gt; Gobindaganj municipal area.From there, the goods are sent to various=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; parts of the country, including Gobindaganj, Gaibandha, and=20=20<br />
&gt; Bogra.Indian goods worth about Tk 5 million are being smuggled into=20=20<br />
&gt; the country by using the two routes everyday.<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; Moreover, Indian items smuggled in through the Palashbar-Ghoraghat=20=20<br />
&gt; hilly route are offloaded in the areas of Kalibarihat and Uday Sagar=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; of Palashbari Subdistrict town, Gaibandha, and Rangpur bus stop.From=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; here, the drugs -- mostly Phensidyl syrups -- are sent to Gaibandha=20=20<br />
&gt; Town and its adjacent areas.Even the drug items brought into the=20=20<br />
&gt; country through this route are being sent to Mymensigh through=20=20<br />
&gt; Roumari in Kurigram District and Dewang anj in Jamalpur District=20=20<br />
&gt; through river routes by using the Balasi ferry terminal in=20=20<br />
&gt; Phulchhari Subdistrict.<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; Tozammel Hossain, president of the Gobindaganj Subdistrict unit of=20=20<br />
&gt; the ruling Bangladesh Awami League (BAL), said that unhindered=20=20<br />
&gt; smuggling spree was going on through the routes under the=20=20<br />
&gt; supervision of the police.But, the re was no one to protest it, he=20=20<br />
&gt; said.He said: &quot;The leaders and workers of different political=20=20<br />
&gt; parties might have their involvement with the smuggling=20=20<br />
&gt; syndicates.But, I do not know anything about this.&quot;<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; Abdul Matin, convener of the Gobindaganj Citizen's Committee, said=20=20<br />
&gt; that people from all walks of live in the area knew about the=20=20<br />
&gt; smuggling and offloading of goods.But, the smugglers were conducting=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; their drives by using political identities and with helps from the=20=20<br />
&gt; police, he alleged.As a result, he said that none dares to speak=20=20<br />
&gt; against the crime.<br />

&gt; into a danger zone lately with reports in the US and the Indian=20=20<br />
&gt; media of Islamabad's handing over of the Gilgit-Baltistan region of=20=20<br />
&gt; the Pakistan-administered Kashmir to China and China's deployment of=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; 11,000 troops in that region. Coupled with other recent geopolitical=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; developments, these reports indicate the re-shaping of the regional=20=20<br />
&gt; strategic landscape and of Delhi's dogged determination to challenge=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; Beijing's pre-eminence in regional and global politics, with help=20=20<br />
&gt; from Bangladesh. Besides, the intensified Indo-Chinese tension=20=20<br />
&gt; seriously undercuts efforts by people of India, China and Russia for=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; greater regional collaborations; despite the foreign ministers of=20=20<br />
&gt; the three nations slated to meet in Bangalore on October 26-27.<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; Denial unheeded Reacting to the reports that started to make=20=20<br />
&gt; headlines in late August, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Jiang=20=20<br />
&gt; Yu said o n September 2, &quot;We believe these attempts of some people=20=20<br />
&gt; to fabricate stories to provoke China-Pakistan or China-India=20=20<br />
&gt; relations are doomed to fail.&quot;   Pakistan too issued similar=20=20<br />
&gt; rebuttal. A Pakistani Foreign Office spokesman, Abdul Basit,=20=20<br />
&gt; strongly denied the news being circulated in the American and Indian=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; media and said on August 31, &quot;The Chinese were working on landslide,=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; flood hit areas and on the destroyed Korakoram Highway with the=20=20<br />
&gt; permission of Pakistani Government.&quot; All such denials did little,=20=20<br />
&gt; however, to assuage<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; Indian concerns. India's ambassador to China, S. Jaishankar, met=20=20<br />
&gt; with the Chinese vice Minister for Foreign Affairs, Zhang Zhijun, on=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; September 3 in Beijing and conveyed New Delhi's concern over the=20=20<br />
&gt; presence of Chinese troops in Gilgit-Baltistan. India also further=20=20<br />
&gt; reinforced its military capability along the 2,521 mile China-India=20=20<br />
&gt; borders.<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; Historical animosity Although a recent New York Time report had=20=20<br />
&gt; linked the Chinese military presence in Kashmir to China's plans to=20=20<br />
&gt; gain a &quot;grip on the strategic area to ensure unfettered road and=20=20<br />
&gt; rail access to the Gulf through Pakistan,&quot; the animosity is rooted=20=20<br />
&gt; in historic claims and counter claims made by the two nuclear armed=20=20<br />
&gt; neighbours on each other's territories. The New York Times report=20=20<br />
&gt; said there were two important new developments in Gilgit-Baltistan;=20=20<br />
&gt; a simmering rebellion against the Pakistani rule and the influx of=20=20<br />
&gt; an estimated 7,000 to 11,000 soldiers of the Chinese People's=20=20<br />
&gt; Liberation Army (PLA) in the area. In reality, these reports are=20=20<br />
&gt; tied with recent Indian war preparation and entrenchment of military=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; capability along mutual borders on which the two nations had fought=20=20<br />
&gt; a brief but bloody war in 1962. The border dispute dates back to=20=20<br />
&gt; 1914 when the colonial Britain hosted a conference with the Chinese=20=20<br />
&gt; and the Tibetan governments to demarcate the Tibetan border along=20=20<br />
&gt; the so called McMahon line. China never recognised th e McMahon Line=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; and claims 90,000 sq km, nearly all of what India now calls=20=20<br />
&gt; Arunachal Pradesh (about 2000 sq kms), its own territory. Besides,=20=20<br />
&gt; India accuses China of occupying 8,000 sq km of its territory in=20=20<br />
&gt; Kashmir. The latest spark also emanated from Delhi's upping the ante=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; on August 26 following Beijing's refusal to grant a visa to Indian=20=20<br />
&gt; army's Northern Command Chief, Lt. Gen. BS Jaswal, to visit Beijing=20=20<br />
&gt; as an Indian military delegation member, saying the office r=20=20<br />
&gt; oversees Jammu and Kashmir which 'is a disputed area.' The incident=20=20<br />
&gt; left Delhi snubbed, insulted and injured; more so when Beijing asked=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; to replace Lt. Gen. Jaswal, something India refused to comply and=20=20<br />
&gt; ordered instead a demarche by cancelling a scheduled visit by a=20=20<br />
&gt; Chinese military delegation to India's National Defence College.=20=20<br />
&gt; Delhi also ordered cancellation of another scheduled visit by Indian=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; military officials to China.<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; Offensive postures The ongoing rivalry may end up with another war,=20=20<br />
&gt; acco rding to many analysts. Since 2007, India has been aggressively=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; racing to match China for regional and global power, building and=20=20<br />
&gt; bolstering airstrips and army outposts along the common borders and=20=20<br />
&gt; rebuilding run-down roads and infrastructures. In June 2009, it=20=20<br />
&gt; started building a tunnel to bypass the virtually impassable Rohtang=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; Pass to ensure all-weather access to Ladakh, which abuts the Tibetan=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; Plateau. Coupled with recent procurement of huge state-of-the-art=20=20<br />
&gt; military hardware and Delhi's strategic alliance with the USA, these=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; moves kept Beijing busy in shoring up its own deficiencies,=20=20<br />
&gt; tactically and strategically, while Delhi replaced its 'cold start'=20=20<br />
&gt; strategy with an aggressive doctrine to confront both China and=20=20<br />
&gt; Pakistan simultaneously. These bellicose postures are heading toward=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; the outbreak of another major war among the two regional giants.=20=20<br />
&gt; Besides defending the sovereignty of the Arunachal Pradesh, Delhi=20=20<br />
&gt; wants to recover the Chinese-administered Aksai Chin, whic h India=20=20<br />
&gt; claims as part of its territory. Along the Kashmir frontier, north=20=20<br />
&gt; of Ladakh stands the disputed Siachen Glacier, an ice-capped river=20=20<br />
&gt; basin that had provoked both India and Pakistan to claiming and=20=20<br />
&gt; fighting over, almost frequently since the 1980s. Both India and=20=20<br />
&gt; Pakistan maintain military outposts on the 20,000 feet high altitude=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; of the Siachen's glacier- capped ranges.<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; Bangladesh's concern Having lost Tibet to China in 1959, India took=20=20<br />
&gt; over Sikkim's sovereignty in 1975, but the predicament posed by the=20=20<br />
&gt; Siliguri Corridor in West Bengal, with an average width of 21 km to=20=20<br />
&gt; 40 km only, in connecting the north eastern region with the Indian=20=20<br />
&gt; mainland could not be reconciled as yet. That is what makes=20=20<br />
&gt; Bangladesh an integral part of the Indian and the Chinese defence=20=20<br />
&gt; priorities and makes it extremely difficult for Dhaka to maintain=20=20<br />
&gt; either a neutral stance, or align militarily with either of the=20=20<br />
&gt; protagonists. It also gives birth to a cliche, if not a strategic do=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; ctrine, that &quot;He who controls Bangladesh will control north east=20=20<br />
&gt; India,&quot; making Bangladesh susceptible to pre-emptive military=20=20<br />
&gt; invasion by either of the protagonists. Geopolitically, China has=20=20<br />
&gt; two major claims over territories that India claims to be its own.=20=20<br />
&gt; The claim in the western sector involves Aksai Chin in the=20=20<br />
&gt; northeastern Ladakh District in Jammu and Kashmir. The eastern=20=20<br />
&gt; sector claim involves the territory belonging to the British era=20=20<br />
&gt; North-East Frontier Agency (NEFA) abutting Bangladesh, Nepal, Bhutan=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; and Myanmar; including the Tibetan-Naga-inhabited Arunachal Pradesh=20=20<br />
&gt; which Delhi has turned into its 24th state on 20th February, 1987.=20=20<br />
&gt; These lands were fought over before. During the 1962 Indo-China war,=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; the well-trained and well-armed PLA troops overpowered the ill-=20<br />
&gt; equipped Indian troops, who found themselves not properly=20=20<br />
&gt; acclimatized to fight at high altitudes. Following initial setbacks,=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; Indian troops desperately sought to regroup and the Indian army s=20=20<br />
&gt; trengthened its defensive positions in the NEFA and Ladakh to=20=20<br />
&gt; repulse possible Chinese attacks through Sikkim and Bhutan. The=20=20<br />
&gt; Indian attempt failed and the war reached close to Bangladesh=20=20<br />
&gt; frontiers (then East Pakistan), despite many Indian army units=20=20<br />
&gt; having moved from Calcutta, Bihar, Nagaland, and Punjab to guard the=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; northern front iers of West Bengal and Assam. The western NEFA=20=20<br />
&gt; witnessed deployment of three Indian brigades while two other=20=20<br />
&gt; brigades were deployed in Sikkim and the West Bengal border with=20=20<br />
&gt; Bhutan. Light Stuart tanks were drawn from the Eastern Command=20=20<br />
&gt; headquarters at Calcutta to bolster such deployments. Yet, an=20=20<br />
&gt; unrelenting Chinese onslaught wiped out virtually all Indian=20=20<br />
&gt; resistance in Kameng and, by November 18, the PLA had penetrated=20=20<br />
&gt; close to the outskirts of Tezpur, Assam, a major frontier town=20=20<br />
&gt; within the artillery range from Bangladesh and barely 50 kilometres=20=20<br />
&gt; from the Assam-NEFA border. Sensing Indian helplessness, China=20=20<br />
&gt; declared a unilateral ceasefir e on November 21. Beijing also=20=20<br />
&gt; respected the McMahan line and withdrew troops beyond what it=20=20<br />
&gt; regards as 'unaccepted' Line of Actual Control (LoAC).<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; The big picture There are those who blame the USA for the latest=20=20<br />
&gt; escalation in tension and military preparedness in Asia. They say=20=20<br />
&gt; the US department of defence annual report's claim that 'the pace=20=20<br />
&gt; and scope of China's military modernisation have increased over the=20=20<br />
&gt; past decade' has scared Delhi. The report cautioned that 'extreme=20=20<br />
&gt; secrecy is increasingly difficult to reconcile with China's role in=20=20<br />
&gt; the integrated global economy, which depends on transparency.' That=20=20<br />
&gt; is perhaps part of the story. Beijing's quest for access to the=20=20<br />
&gt; Indian Ocean and the Persian Gulf regions for much needed energy=20=20<br />
&gt; resources lay at the centre of its alliance making in the region,=20=20<br />
&gt; although the Indian story is rooted more in geopolitical quest for=20=20<br />
&gt; land. Although other intelligence reports indicate Beijing is=20=20<br />
&gt; constructing over 22 tunnel and a r ail link between Pakistan=20=20<br />
&gt; administered Kashmir and China, and further extending the Karakoram=20=20<br />
&gt; Highway that connects China's Muslim predominant Xinjiang province=20=20<br />
&gt; with Pakistan, the tunnel construction is related to a projected gas=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; pipeline from Iran to China that would cross the Karakorams through=20=20<br />
&gt; Gilgit. India, however, fears they could be also used for missiles=20=20<br />
&gt; storage sites. They plausibly could, but such Indian fear is grossly=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; misplaced. Given that Beijing has financed the construction of=20=20<br />
&gt; Pakistani naval bases at Gawadar, Pasni and Ormara in Balochistan,=20=20<br />
&gt; such connectivity aims mainly at transporting cargo and oil from the=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; Persian Gulf to eastern China within 48 hours. While those could be=20=20<br />
&gt; least of our concerns, Bangladesh must prepare not to get overrun by=20=<br />

&gt; were arrested on Iranian territory in July 2009 after illegally=20=20<br />
&gt; crossing the border from the mountains of northern Iraq's Kurdistan=20=20<br />
&gt; region. &quot;For two of the defendants, both male, an arrest warrant has=20=<br />

&gt; been issued, (while) the female co-defendant has been granted a five=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; billion rials (almost $500,000) bail,&quot; said the Islamic Republic=20=20<br />
&gt; judiciary official. He hinted at the practice of leniency in=20=20<br />

&gt; Republic had earlier called off the release of Shourd over=20=20<br />

&gt; &quot;Our caution is due to political considerations, but MPs will=20=20<br />

&gt; the MKO has masterminded terrorist operations in Iran and Iraq,=20=20<br />

&gt; Cylinder as the embodiment of human values and a cultural heritage=20=20<br />

=20<br />
&gt; an invaluable yardstick to evaluate the performance of politicians=20=20<br />
&gt; and rulers throughout history. The Achaemenid relic, on loan from=20=20<br />

&gt; everyone is entitled to freedom of thought and choice and all=20=20<br />

&gt; Iran due to sanctions, traders added. Iran has been storing crude=20=20<br />

&gt; China Owns 'Indisputable Sovereignty Over Diaoyu Islands<br />
&gt; Editorial: &quot;China Will Absolutely Not Give In; Japan Must Not=20=20<br />
&gt; Misjudge the Situation&quot; - Wen Wei Po Online<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; Monday September 13, 2010 19:39:12 GMT<br />
&gt; On the issue of the Diaoyu Islands, China has time and again=20=20<br />
&gt; reiterated that the Diaoyu Islands and nearby islets have always=20=20<br />
&gt; been Chinese territory since times immemorial, and that China owns=20=20<br />
&gt; indisputable sovereignty over these islands. The 740,000 square km=20=20<br />
&gt; &quot;maritime exclusive economic zones&quot; of the Diaoyu Islands and nearby=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; islets are almost the total of Chinese waters in the Nansha=20=20<br />
&gt; (Spratly) Islands. Located near the Chinese side between Taiwan,=20=20<br />
&gt; Chinese mainland, and Japan's Okinawa, the Diaoyu Islands are very=20=20<br />
&gt; important strategically on the frontline of the primary chain of=20=20<br />
&gt; islands in the western Pacific. Japan has completely misjudged the=20=20<br />
&gt; situation in the recent illegal seizure of the Chinese fishing boat=20=20<br />
&gt; and fishermen and the escalation of the incident in an attempt to=20=20<br />
&gt; brazenly occupy the Diaoyu Islands. On the issue of the Diaoyu=20=20<br />
&gt; Islands, which has special strategic importance and strategic=20=20<br />
&gt; resources, China will absolutely not tolerate national humiliation=20=20<br />
&gt; and occupation of the traditional territory. Japan must not=20=20<br />
&gt; miscalculate.<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; China does not make trouble but is not afraid of trouble. Many years=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; ago, in response to India's encroachment activities in the border=20=20<br />
&gt; area, China, after futile negotiations, resolutely waged a=20=20<br />
&gt; counteroffensive in the border area; faced with the former Soviet=20=20<br />
&gt; Union's strong military pressures, China did the same by fighting=20=20<br />
&gt; back bravely at the Zhenbao (Damansky) Island; and Vietnam, self-=20<br />
&gt; confident of the former Soviet Union's backing, frequently stirred=20=20<br />
&gt; up trouble in the Sino-Vietnamese border, which Chinese=20=20<br />
&gt; counterattacked decisively. If Japan m isjudges the situation, it=20=20<br />
&gt; will be lifting a rock only to drop it on its own toes.<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; Japan's arrogant and unreasonable attitude toward the latest Diaoyu=20=20<br />
&gt; Islands incident compelled China to make tough response. Of course,=20=20<br />
&gt; China would take diplomatic, political, and other actions to defend=20=20<br />
&gt; China's territorial sovereignty and national dignity. Immediately,=20=20<br />
&gt; China dispatched law enforcement vessels of the fishery=20=20<br />
&gt; administration to the waters near the Diaoyu Islands not only to=20=20<br />
&gt; protect the lives and safety of property of Chinese fishermen but=20=20<br />
&gt; also to declare, tit for tat, China's sovereignty over the Diaoyu=20=20<br />
&gt; Islands. As Japan has so far not backed away, China, in addition to=20=20<br />
&gt; increasing diplomatic pressures, is expected to take more follow-up=20=20<br />
&gt; actions. The purpose of the recent steadfast action undertaken by=20=20<br />
&gt; China is not only to defend the sovereignty over the Diaoyu Islands=20=20<br />
&gt; but also to display the all-out determination to safeguard national=20=20<br />
&gt; sovereignty and territorial integrity .<br />

&gt; MDG Targets in Africa: UNDP Official<br />
&gt; Xinhua &quot;Interview&quot; by Laila Kabbaj: &quot;'Partnership And Commitment'=20=20<br />
&gt; Needed To Achieve MDG Targets in Africa: UNDP Official&quot; - Xinhua<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; Monday Septemb er 13, 2010 19:38:57 GMT<br />
&gt; UNITED NATIONS, Sept. 13 (Xinhua) -- As the high-level summit on the=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) approaches, &quot; partnership and=20=20<br />
&gt; commitment&quot; will be essential for Africa to sustain progress in=20=20<br />
&gt; achieving the targets, a UN official told Xinhua in a recent=20=20<br />
&gt; interview.<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; Selim Jahan, director of the Poverty Practice Division of the UN=20=20<br />
&gt; Development Program (UNDP), said a &quot;concrete plan of action&quot; is=20=20<br />
&gt; needed to help the region overcome challenges in the wake of the=20=20<br />
&gt; global economic crisis.Over 150 heads of state or government will=20=20<br />
&gt; gather at the United Nations Headquarters in New York next week in=20=20<br />
&gt; order to assess the status of the efforts to reach the MDGs targets=20=20<br />
&gt; and revitalize efforts to meet the eight anti-poverty goals by the=20=20<br />
&gt; 2015 deadline.As world governments continue to grapple with the=20=20<br />
&gt; effects of the recent economic downturn, food insecurity, oil price=20=20<br />
&gt; volatility and climate change, the prospects of achieving the MDGs=20=20<br />
&gt; by the target date have been thrown into uncertainty -- particularly=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; in sub-Saharan Africa.Jahan warned that sub-Saharan Africa will face=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; &quot;severe human development impacts&quot; as a consequence of the=20=20<br />
&gt; crises.GREATEST CHALLENGEAccording to the 2010 World Bank global=20=20<br />
&gt; monitoring report, &quot;sub- Saharan Africa poses the greatest=20=20<br />
&gt; challenge, it has the highest poverty rates and will have the most=20=20<br />
&gt; difficulty achieving its regional poverty reduction targets.&quot;Between=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; 2000 and 2009 the GDP growth rate in sub-Saharan Africa has gone=20=20<br />
&gt; from 5.5 percent to 2.1 percent, according to Jahan.Reduced global=20=20<br />
&gt; demand for exports, decline in capital flows including foreign=20=20<br />
&gt; direct investment (FDI), and remittances are part of the global=20=20<br />
&gt; financial and economic crisis' immediate impact on the=20=20<br />
&gt; region.Despite the immediate downturn, he noted that the most=20=20<br />
&gt; devastating consequences will be felt in the long term, as they=20=20<br />
&gt; threaten to erode sustained progress in development.The impact on=20=20<br />
&gt; infant mortality are particularly tragic, &quot; because of the crisis in=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; 2009, estimates have been that an additional 30,000 to 50,000=20=20<br />
&gt; children are dying in sub-Saharan Africa,&quot; said Jahan.Budget=20=20<br />
&gt; constraints on donor countries have also exacerbated the situation,=20=20<br />
&gt; as commitments to delivering aid continue to be unfulfilled.Jahan=20=20<br />
&gt; indicated the peculiar trend in the flow of external financing or=20=20<br />
&gt; official development assistance (ODA) to sub-Saharan Africa.&quot;Between=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; 2007 onwards, total amount of aid to sub-Saharan Africa has actually=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; gone up from 39 billion U.S. dollars, to 41 billion, to 44 billion.=20=20<br />
&gt; Now does it mean that the commitments of the donors have been kept?=20=20<br />
&gt; No,&quot; he said, citing that an additional 17 billion U.S. dollars=20=20<br />
&gt; could have been delivered in ODA if commitments had been=20=20<br />
&gt; met.Indicating that aid distribution poses another issue in=20=20<br />
&gt; development funding, Jahan said that tracking the flow of ODA in sub-=20<br />
&gt; Saharan Africa &quot;needs to be revisited.&quot; In essence, there is a need=20=20<br />
&gt; to track where the money is going.Nigeria, Ethiopia, and Tanzania=20=20<br />
&gt; are the three major recipients of aid in the region. &quot;These are all=20=20<br />
&gt; big countries in sub-Saharan Africa, therefore a number of smaller=20=20<br />
&gt; countries may not get the kind of assistance -- particularly the ODA=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; -- that they are so much dependent upon. I think this is one issue=20=20<br />
&gt; that needs to be looked at,&quot; said Jahan.As the global economic=20=20<br />
&gt; crisis continues to unfold, producing growth in Africa will not come=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; solely from money and resource handouts.Resources and aid are=20=20<br />
&gt; important, Jahan noted, but they cannot stand alone. &quot;We cannot have=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; a resource-centric approach to the MDGs, it does not work that way,&quot;=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; he said.&quot;You cannot say give me 50 billion dollars today, I'll take=20=20<br />
&gt; care of poverty tomorrow. There are more structural issues, more=20=20<br />
&gt; complex realities that need to be dealt with,&quot; he added.Progress in=20=20<br />
&gt; meeting the development ta rgets will be largely dependent on=20=20<br />
&gt; strategies that allow sub-Saharan African countries to help=20=20<br />
&gt; themselves.HELPING AFRICA HELP ITSELFJahan highlighted that=20=20<br />
&gt; &quot;national commitment&quot; and &quot;national ownership&quot; are essential for sub-=20<br />
&gt; Saharan African states to make more effective use of both their=20=20<br />
&gt; macro and micro-economic policies for development.Commitment and=20=20<br />
&gt; ownership &quot;have to be formulated, organized, implemented locally.=20=20<br />
&gt; They cannot be implanted or be pushed down from outside. National=20=20<br />
&gt; ownership is absolutely important,&quot; said Jahan. Yet, commitment=20=20<br />
&gt; cannot come if one does not have the capacity to do so, he=20=20<br />
&gt; added.With demand for food in sub-Saharan Africa expected to reach=20=20<br />
&gt; 100 billion U.S. dollars by 2015 according to World Bank estimates,=20=20<br />
&gt; food insecurity presents a major bottleneck in efforts to build=20=20<br />
&gt; national capacity.The UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)=20=20<br />
&gt; reports that 30 percent of people in sub-Saharan Africa suffer from=20=20<br />
&gt; hunger.With agricul ture providing 30 percent of GDP and employing=20=20<br />
&gt; 70 percent of the population, Jahan said national food security=20=20<br />
&gt; policies should hinge on three dimensions: enhancing agricultural=20=20<br />
&gt; productivity, linking food security with nutritional needs, and=20=20<br />
&gt; social protection for vulnerable groups.Developing a cost-effective=20=20<br />
&gt; marketing system that will provide an integrated package of inputs=20=20<br />
&gt; to farmers and climate change adaptation are key. &quot;I think sub-=20<br />
&gt; Saharan Africa is ready for an African green revolution, and I think=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; we should support them on that,&quot; he said.Despite the bleak outlook=20=20<br />
&gt; for progress in achieving the MDGs provided by the statistical data,=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; there are examples of success.The introduction of improved seed and=20=20<br />
&gt; advances in technology have increased agricultural productivity in=20=20<br />
&gt; Ghana. As a result, &quot; it has been able to reduce the incidents of=20=20<br />
&gt; hunger from 34 percent to 9 percent between 1990 and 2004. Ghana is=20=20<br />
&gt; very much on its way to eliminate hunger,&quot; said Jahan.Pr ogress has=20=20<br />
&gt; been uneven throughout sub-Saharan Africa, partly due to the=20=20<br />
&gt; geographic enormity of the region. Although one country may cite=20=20<br />
&gt; progress in combating hunger, another may see an increase in child=20=20<br />
&gt; mortality rates.Jahan noted that this diversity, can be used to=20=20<br />
&gt; establish partnerships throughout the developing world --=20=20<br />
&gt; particularly through what he calls &quot;south-south collaboration.&quot;&quot;In=20=20<br />
&gt; the South you have so many development experiments going on, you=20=20<br />
&gt; have so many innovative approaches. For example, India has done a=20=20<br />
&gt; great job with their mid-day meal program at schools, where 110=20=20<br />
&gt; million children are benefiting -- can (this program) be replicated=20=20<br />
&gt; in Nigeria?&quot;FROM RHETORIC TO ACTIONTen years have passed since 189=20=20<br />
&gt; UN member states signed the Millennium Declaration that established=20=20<br />
&gt; the Millennium Development Goals. With only five years left until=20=20<br />
&gt; the 2015 deadline, sub- Saharan Africa faces a steep uphill climb to=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; overcome challenges.As the September MDGs s ummit approaches, Jahan=20=20<br />
&gt; says he'd like to see a message of hope and a concrete plan of=20=20<br />
&gt; action from world leaders.&quot;I want to see a message of hope based on=20=20<br />
&gt; the success stories, the proven interventions, the country level=20=20<br />
&gt; evidence. There can be a message of despair, but that is not going=20=20<br />
&gt; to help anybody,&quot; he said.&quot;We are not just talking in terms of=20=20<br />
&gt; rhetoric,&quot; Jahan emphasized. &quot;If we have a positive message with=20=20<br />
&gt; very concrete evidence, if we have a concrete action plan and we=20=20<br />
&gt; have committed partnerships, then I think we have achieved a=20=20<br />
&gt; lot.&quot;There are no excuses for stalling progress in achieving the=20=20<br />
&gt; MDGs, said Jahan. &quot;I strongly believe that the world has the=20=20<br />
&gt; resources, and the knowledge, and the technology to make a=20=20<br />
&gt; breakthrough.&quot;&quot;I think basically what we need to do is put our=20=20<br />
&gt; heads, hands and hearts together. That 3-H approach can really make=20=20<br />
&gt; a difference,&quot; he added.(Description of Source: Beijing Xinhua in=20=20<br />

&gt; killed and injured in the violence in the recent weeks.The Defence=20=20<br />

&gt; The following is a selection of highlights from the West Indian=20=20<br />
&gt; press on 13 September 2010 - India -- OSC Summary<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; Monday September 13, 2010 12:13:47 GMT<br />
&gt; The editorial says the BJP is forced to watch helplessly as its=20=20<br />
&gt; younger generation of leaders is making compromises for power=20=20<br />
&gt; without bothering about the seniors. The BJP's 42-year-old leader=20=20<br />
&gt; Arjun Munda, who occupied the post of Jharkhand chief minister for a=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; thi rd time, has also sidelined the party's basic culture. Arjun did=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; achieve a hat-trick with Shibu Soren of Jharkhand Mukti Morcha=20=20<br />
&gt; (JMM), who voted against the BJP and in favor of the Congress party=20=20<br />
&gt; in Parliament, but not everybody seems to be happy about it in the=20=20<br />
&gt; party.<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; The editorial adds that while the BJP is suffering setback in the=20=20<br />
&gt; states in which it is in power, Munda has surprisingly come to power=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; with the help of Shibu Soren in Jharkhand. The uprights within the=20=20<br />
&gt; BJP do not seem to have liked it and this displeasure was clearly=20=20<br />
&gt; expressed. Senior leaders turned their back on Arjun Munda's=20=20<br />
&gt; swearing-in ceremony. Along with L.K. Advani, party president Nitin=20=20<br />
&gt; Gadkari also turned his back on the ceremony. These people were=20=20<br />
&gt; trying to indicate that it was not good for the party's image.=20=20<br />
&gt; However, the real question now is for how long this marriage is=20=20<br />
&gt; going to last. On this pretext, it was seen that the new BJP=20=20<br />
&gt; generation is a little better at the game of power than the Congress=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; party.<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; The editorial goes on to say it is clear that the alliance is not=20=20<br />
&gt; going to last for long. Their government had come crashing down just=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; last May because of differences between them. Within three months of=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; that divorce, both parties are coming together again, claiming that=20=20<br />
&gt; they are doing so to deal with the drought in the state and=20=20<br />
&gt; development.<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; The editorial further says that despite getting seven chief=20=20<br />
&gt; ministers in the last 10 years, Jharkhand's woes are not coming to=20=20<br />
&gt; an end. The state is continuously in the grip of instability. The=20=20<br />
&gt; question of Naxalism (Maoist insurgency) is haunting the state.=20=20<br />
&gt; People are also tired of this instability. Bureaucracy and the Mafia=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; are taking advantage of this instability. The way for development is=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; not yet paved. At such a time, Munda is coming to power again=20=20<br />
&gt; prostrating before Shibu Soren. Only the coming time would decide=20=20<br />
&gt; whether he uses the power for people's welfare, or for his own good.<br />

&gt; editorial entitled: &quot;Salman Khan Trying To be Over Smart.&quot; The=20=20<br />
&gt; editorial says Hindi film actor Salman Khan is trying to be over=20=20<br />
&gt; smart. He seems to have lost his mental balance. He is trying to=20=20<br />
&gt; appease the enemy country by saying that the Pakistani Government=20=20<br />
&gt; was not involved in the 26/11 Mumbai terror attack.<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; The editorial asks why Salman needed to do such anti-India advocacy=20=20<br />
&gt; for the Mumbai attack after 21 months. He may have done this monkey-=20<br />
&gt; like act to get cheap publicity and make his film popular in the=20=20<br />
&gt; enemy country, but he has shown his real mentality by showing his=20=20<br />
&gt; love for Pakistan. Salman is saying that the laxity of Indian=20=20<br />
&gt; security agencies was responsible for this attack, while not holding=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; the Pakist ani Government responsible for it. The entire world knows=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; what role the Pakistani Government played in the Mumbai terror=20=20<br />
&gt; attack. Otherwise also, Salman Khan is a controversial character. He=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; has also spent a few months in jail on charges of killing Chinkara,=20=20<br />
&gt; an endangered species of deer, while sho oting for a film in=20=20<br />
&gt; Jodhpur. He is also facing charges of killing a few persons,=20=20<br />
&gt; crushing them under his car while driving in an inebriated=20=20<br />
&gt; condition. He had also threatened actress Aishwarya Rai once.<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; The editorial adds that Salman has tried to betray the country that=20=20<br />
&gt; gave him all the name and fame. Now, when his new film is being=20=20<br />
&gt; released, he has tried to get cheap publicity by making such a=20=20<br />
&gt; statement to a Pakistani channel. It would not come as a surprise if=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; his tendency boomerangs. His film could suffer a jolt in India for=20=20<br />
&gt; such advocacy of Pakistan. The Shiv Sena and BJP have taken Salman=20=20<br />
&gt; Khan to task. Salman's anti-India statement could cost him dearly.=20=20<br />

&gt; Moe Says It Respects Professionalism In Revising Textbooks<br />
&gt; By Lee Hsien-feng &amp;amp; Bear Lee - Central News Agency<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; Monday September 13, 2010 12:51:20 GMT<br />
&gt; Taipei, Sept. 13 (CNA) -- Education Minister Wu Chin-ji said Monday=20=20<br />
&gt; that his ministry would fully respect professional viewpoints after=20=20<br />
&gt; members of the opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) accused=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; t he government of trying to inject revisionist history into senior=20=20<br />
&gt; high school textbooks.<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; Wu was responding to criticism by DPP lawmakers who said the=20=20<br />
&gt; Ministry of Education's (MOE's) draft guidelines for rewriting=20=20<br />
&gt; history textbooks were an attempt to &quot;brainwash&quot; students.The draft=20=20<br />
&gt; guidelines were released by the ministry earlier in the day.DPP=20=20<br />
&gt; Legislator Kuan Bi-ling said that under the guidelines made by the=20=20<br />
&gt; previous government in 1995, the origin of Taiwan could be traced to=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; aboriginal Taiwanese, an Austronesian people whose ties to the=20=20<br />
&gt; island are said to go back 5,000-6,000 years.Many scholars believe=20=20<br />
&gt; Austronesian peoples originated from Taiwan and spread as far as=20=20<br />
&gt; Madagascar in the Indian Ocean, Easter Island, Southeast Asia, New=20=20<br />
&gt; Zealand and other Pacific Islands.Kuan said the latest guidelines=20=20<br />
&gt; were aimed at &quot;binding Taiwan together with China&quot; by saying that=20=20<br />
&gt; Taiwan has belonged to China since the &quot;Three Kingdoms&quot; era of=20=20<br />
&gt; 208-280 A.D.Th e guidelines go further to say that during the era,=20=20<br />
&gt; the Kingdom of Wu invaded the Ryukyu Islands and &quot;Yichou&quot; in the=20=20<br />
&gt; East China Sea, with &quot;Yichou, &quot; or land of the barbarians, referring=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; to Taiwan, Kuan said.Yeh Yi-jin, another DPP lawmaker, said that the=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; Kuomintang-led government has been trying to force Taiwan people=20=20<br />
&gt; into accepting the idea that &quot;Taiwan has long been part of China&quot; in=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; an attempt to pave the way for eventual unification of the two sides=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; the Taiwan Straits.The DPP advocates Taiwan's independence from=20=20<br />
&gt; China.Kuan said that the DPP caucus will do its best to prevent the=20=20<br />
&gt; &quot;misleading ideas&quot; from being included in the new history=20=20<br />
&gt; textbooks.Minister Wu said that the draft guidelines were decided=20=20<br />
&gt; upon by a group of experts after 38 meetings, and that his ministry=20=20<br />

&gt; Monday September 13, 2010 10:46:30 GMT<br />
&gt; Does a dialogue with Pakistan serve any purpose?Let's us start by=20=20<br />
&gt; assuming that it does: talks with that country do have some=20=20<br />
&gt; relevance.History can be rewritten, but geography cannot be=20=20<br />
&gt; changed.Pakistan is a permanent fixture in India's neighbourhood; it=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; cannot be wished away.Then, again, jaw-jaw is better than war-war.An=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; unproductive dialogue with Pakistan is better than no dialogue;=20=20<br />
&gt; acrimonious engagement is better than estrangement, and so on.All=20=20<br />
&gt; this encapsulates the conventional wisdom, which illuminates the=20=20<br />
&gt; perceptions of men and women of goodwill who light candles in Wagah=20=20<br />
&gt; and Attari to give each other some heart.The counter-intuitive case=20=20<br />
&gt; -- the case against dialogue -- rests on three pillars.First, what=20=20<br />
&gt; does the history of the India-Pakistan dialogue instruct?What has=20=20<br />
&gt; the resumption of the frozen composite dialogue in 2004 following=20=20<br />
&gt; the Kargil conflict (May-July, 1999) and the border confrontation=20=20<br />
&gt; crisis (December, 2001-October, 2002) yielded?Much lies in the eyes=20=20<br />
&gt; of the beholder.The optimists argue that the resumption of=20=20<br />
&gt; diplomatic ties, people-to-people contacts and some modest trade,=20=20<br />
&gt; especially between the divided parts of Kashmir, but particularly=20=20<br />
&gt; the cessation of firing across the Line of Control, are huge gains=20=20<br />
&gt; from the dialogue.Further, hotlines have been established between=20=20<br />
&gt; various authorities to defuse tensions, and agreements reached on=20=20<br />
&gt; the pre-notification of missile tests and early intimation of=20=20<br />
&gt; nuclear accidents.These are significant confi dence-building steps,=20=20<br />
&gt; but substantive problems like the Siachen and Sir Creek disputes and=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; the overarching issues of Kashmir and terrorism remain in=20=20<br />
&gt; limbo.What, then, is the practical utility?Second, what is the=20=20<br />
&gt; intrinsic capacity of Pakistan to enter this dialogue?The current=20=20<br />
&gt; floods in Pakistan have pitilessly revealed its administrative=20=20<br />
&gt; inadequacies.True, the floods were of unprecedented ferocity, but=20=20<br />
&gt; the reluctance of the international community to help Pakistan is=20=20<br />
&gt; instructive.Why? What has occasioned this sudden dip in=20=20<br />
&gt; international humanitarianism?Quite bluntly, there is little=20=20<br />
&gt; assurance available that the aid provided would not end up being=20=20<br />
&gt; embezzled by Pakistan's besmirched civilian and military=20=20<br />
&gt; kleptocracy.This became apparent in 2005 during Pakistan's handling=20=20<br />
&gt; of the earthquake in Kashmir.The leakage of funds during that=20=20<br />
&gt; natural disaster is fresh in the minds of international donors, and=20=20<br />
&gt; explains their present parsimoniousness.There are persistent reports=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; now, as oc curred after the 2005 earthquake, that the administrative=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; vacuum was filled by jehadi organisations like the Jamaat-ul-Dawa=20=20<br />
&gt; and the Lashkar-e-Toiba.The hope that this represents a truce of=20=20<br />
&gt; sorts is belied, however, by the almost daily violence occurring, in=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; Pakistan's north-western territories, triggered by Pakistani Taliban=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; groups.The sectarian Shia-Sunni dimension to this violence must also=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; be noted, which now afflicts the entire country.In these=20=20<br />
&gt; circumstances, how involved can Pakistan be in this dialogue?Third,=20=20<br />
&gt; is the civilian leadership in Pakistan of any consequence in holding=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; a dialogue with India?This is not a trick question.Despite the=20=20<br />
&gt; success of its most recent elections following an agitation by civil=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; society, leading to paeans being sung to democracy in Pakistan, the=20=20<br />
&gt; real power vests in the Pakistani army working in close tandem with=20=20<br />
&gt; the ISI.Time and again, the civilian leadership has proven to be=20=20<br />
&gt; incompetent, corrupt, faction-ridden, and has been unceremoniously=20=20<br />
&gt; removed by the Pakistani army.In brief, the Pakistan army is the=20=20<br />
&gt; real power in Pakistan, whether directly, or behind the=20=20<br />
&gt; scenes.President Zardari and prime minister Yousuf Raza Gilani=20=20<br />
&gt; continue in office at the pleasure of General Ashfaque Kayani.It=20=20<br />
&gt; would be instructive to observe that Gen Kayani was promoted as army=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; chief after a distinguished tenure in the ISI.And the ISI has=20=20<br />
&gt; organised terrorist strikes against India, including the Mumbai=20=20<br />
&gt; attacks in November, 2008.The question is, therefore, germa ne: what=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; is the point in holding a dialogue with Pakistan's civilian=20=20<br />

&gt; India-Pakistan dialogue should not be aborted for all the usual=20=20<br />

&gt; Latvian Economist Says Country Not Prepared for Second Wave of Crisis<br />
&gt; &quot;World Braces For 2nd Wave of Crisis But Latvia Has No Specific=20=20<br />
&gt; Solution -- Economist&quot; -- BNS headline - BNS<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; Monday September 13, 2010 10:52:31 GMT<br />
&gt; She said Latvia was a small country and turbulences threw small=20=20<br />
&gt; countries about like waves would a woodchip but it was more=20=20<br />
&gt; difficult to sink a woodchip than a large ship therefore usually it=20=20<br />
&gt; is easier for small countries to recover from a crisis, provided=20=20<br />
&gt; that they have smart and creative economic guidance.<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; But in Latvia's case there is a very strong external influence that=20=20<br />
&gt; has lead to heavy dependence on the outside world and not quite good=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; handling of the circumstances, the economist said, suggesting that=20=20<br />
&gt; Latvia should be using the post-crisis opportunities to strengthen=20=20<br />
&gt; its position but nothing much was being done to this end.<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; The world is definitely bracing for the second wave of crisis, as=20=20<br />
&gt; China and India have cut their consumption and things have not=20=20<br />
&gt; worked out for the American housing market, Karnite said. &quot;There is=20=20<br />
&gt; this good phrase: When America sneezes, Europe catches a cold.Now we=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; can expect Europe to have this cold,&quot; the expert said.<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; Karnite pointed out that the Latvian export growth which she=20=20<br />
&gt; described as negligible was ensured by local subsidiaries of=20=20<br />
&gt; European companies and when European parents developed problems,=20=20<br />
&gt; local subsidiaries would also fund themselves in trouble as there=20=20<br />
&gt; would be no more orders.<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; The economist said that Latvia did not have a specific solution for=20=20<br />
&gt; dealing with the situation. &quot;At present everyone is euphoric about=20=20<br />
&gt; the growth which they think would last forever.But for it to last=20=20<br />
&gt; forever, we have to use this time to strengthen the manufacturing=20=20<br />
&gt; industry where small companies, the subsidiaries, prevail at the=20=20<br />
&gt; moment.We need to have our own companies and some of them should be=20=20<br />
&gt; as large as possible,&quot; she said.<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; One of the options would be the inflow of investments from the East=20=20<br />
&gt; that would also be in the interests of the West, Karnite said.<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; &quot;The East could again build industrial structure here because they=20=20<br />
&gt; want it, it would suit them to have a bridge here,&quot; she said, adding=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; that both sides would benefit from the arrangement, but things=20=20<br />
&gt; should be done right to avoid creating ethnic tension.<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; When asked about possible Western investments, the expert said=20=20<br />
&gt; Latvia was unlikely to get any soon.She explained that the West did=20=20<br />
&gt; not quite have the money for investment and risks in Latvia were=20=20<br />
&gt; high at the moment.<br />

&gt; The most valuable resource that a country has is its people.The poor=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; are not a liability, but an asset; they are the producers of=20=20<br />
&gt; essential goods and services we use, they hold up the sky for us for=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; a pittance of a reward.The least that a country can do is to ensure=20=20<br />
&gt; that its people get enough to eat, that already low nutritional=20=20<br />
&gt; standards are not compromised.The present government has achieved a=20=20<br />
&gt; dubious record: the level of per head cereal supply and consumption=20=20<br />
&gt; in India by 2007 at 174 kg fell below the 182 kg recorded by the=20=20<br />
&gt; least developed countries and was considerably below the 196 kg=20=20<br />
&gt; level of Africa.By 2008 Indian average cereal consumption fell=20=20<br />
&gt; further steeply to 156 kg owing to large exports and addition to=20=20<br />
&gt; stocks, and is likely to be lower still in the just-ended drought=20=20<br />
&gt; year.Cereals account for nine-tenths of food grains, which provide=20=20<br />
&gt; three-quarters of both energy intake and protein intake for the=20=20<br />
&gt; average cons umer.Average calorie intake and protein intake have=20=20<br />
&gt; both fallen since 1993.The fall in per head food grain supply and=20=20<br />
&gt; consumption is not new, it has been going on for over a decade, yet=20=20<br />
&gt; our leading economists and policymakers have contributed to=20=20<br />
&gt; increasing food insecurity by their refusal to remove the artificial=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; barriers to distribution created by arbitrarily dividing the=20=20<br />
&gt; population into 'below' and 'above' poverty line.They remain as=20=20<br />
&gt; unmoved as Kalidasa proverbially hacking away at the very branch on=20=20<br />
&gt; which he sat -- they would rather let food grains rot than feed the=20=20<br />
&gt; poor.What explains this torpor, this near-comatose lack of response=20=20<br />
&gt; to a long-brewing crisis of increasing hunger?The answer is that=20=20<br />
&gt; they simply fail conceptually to recognise that hunger is growing=20=20<br />
&gt; because of the serious misconception they have regarding the=20=20<br />
&gt; behaviour of cereal demand in a developing economy.John Maynard=20=20<br />
&gt; Keynes had remarked that the world is moved by little else but=20=20<br />
&gt; ideas.Once a wrong idea ge ts into the head of a policymaker it is=20=20<br />
&gt; very difficult to get it out.Keynes's argument on the paradox of=20=20<br />
&gt; thrift -- if every person saves more, the nation ends up saving less=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; -- is still not understood 75 years after the General Theory and=20=20<br />
&gt; Finance Ministers continue to behave like housewives, cutting back=20=20<br />
&gt; spending to balance budgets even though they have to deal with=20=20<br />
&gt; rampant unemployment.Many ill-advised policies we see creating havoc=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; around us arise from incorrect but obstinately held ideas.The=20=20<br />
&gt; crucial incorrect idea here is that there is nothing surprising=20=20<br />
&gt; about cereal consumption falling -- as a country develops and its=20=20<br />
&gt; per head income rises, people diversify their consumption away from=20=20<br />
&gt; 'inferior' cereals and towards 'superior' food, including milk,=20=20<br />
&gt; eggs, meat, and so on.Most economists thus believe in what they call=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; a 'negative income elasticity of cereal demand' and this influences=20=20<br />
&gt; many others, so they actually interpret declining grain consumption=20=20<br />
&gt; in a positive light.Th eir idea however arises from ignorance and is=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; factually incorrect.It represents a fallacy of composition, in which=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; only a part of total cereal demand -- that directly consumed (as=20=20<br />
&gt; boiled rice, chapatti and so on) -- is taken into account and cereal=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; demanded as livestock feed converted to milk, eggs, meat, and so on=20=20<br />
&gt; is ignored.Fifty years of data from the United Nations Food and=20=20<br />
&gt; Agriculture Organization show that as average income rises in a=20=20<br />
&gt; country and diets become more diversified to superior foods, the per=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; head cereal/food grain demand far from falling rises steeply, and=20=20<br />
&gt; average calorie and protein intake rise in tandem.This happens=20=20<br />
&gt; because much more cereals get consumed indirectly as feed converted=20=20<br />
&gt; to animal products.The higher the average income of a country, the=20=20<br />
&gt; higher is its cereal consumption and the higher the share of the=20=20<br />
&gt; latter, which is indirectly consumed, as the Table shows.The richest=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; country in th e world, the United States, consumed nearly 900 kg per=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; head of cereals in 2007 of which only one-eighth was directly eaten=20=20<br />
&gt; and three-fifths used as feed converted to animal products, with the=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; balance being processed.Its cereal consumption was more than five=20=20<br />
&gt; times higher than the 174 kg recorded by India and its normalised=20=20<br />
&gt; calorie intake (namely, deducting 1000 calories as survival level)=20=20<br />
&gt; was two and a half times higher than in India.China has been raising=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; its income fast -- we are talking of purchasing power parity=20=20<br />
&gt; adjusted U.S. dollars -- and by now it converts a massive 115=20=20<br />
&gt; million tonnes of cereal output as feed to animal products, compared=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; with less than 10 million tonnes in India.Its people consume=20=20<br />
&gt; directly as much as Indians do, but owing to more diversified diets=20=20<br />
&gt; they consume nearly 300 kg cereals per head, 115 kg more than we do=20=20<br />
&gt; and their average calorie and protein intake is higher.Why has=20=20<br />
&gt; India's average consumption declined to such a low level despite=20=20<br />
&gt; rising average income?Since India and China have seen high growth=20=20<br />
&gt; rates, ob servers as disparate as Paul Krugman and George Bush=20=20<br />
&gt; (wrongly) explained the 2008 global food price rise in terms of fast-=20<br />
&gt; rising cereal demand in these countries.They were quite right to=20=20<br />
&gt; expect rising demand in India but quite wrong to think it had=20=20<br />
&gt; actually happened.The fall, which has taken place over the last=20=20<br />
&gt; decade, pushing India below Africa and the least developed=20=20<br />
&gt; countries, is not normal for a country with rising average income,=20=20<br />
&gt; and has resulted from the lopsided, inequitable nature of=20=20<br />
&gt; growth.Krugman et al did not take account of the adverse changes in=20=20<br />
&gt; income distribution, owing to severely income deflating fiscal=20=20<br />
&gt; policies advised by the Bretton Woods Institutions and faithfully=20=20<br />
&gt; implemented by successive Indian governments after 1991, which sent=20=20<br />
&gt; agriculture in particular into a depression from which it has still=20=20<br />
&gt; not recovered.With unemployment rising, with the fruits of growth=20=20<br />
&gt; going to a tiny minority while the masses suffered income deflation,=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; the effects of dietary d iversification by the rich have been=20=20<br />
&gt; swamped by an absolute decline in cereal intake for the=20=20<br />
&gt; majority.National Sample Survey (NSS) data show for all except two=20=20<br />
&gt; States an absolute fall in average animal products intake as well,=20=20<br />
&gt; along with falling direct cereal intake over the reforms period.No=20=20<br />
&gt; wonder average energy and protein intake have both fallen.People=20=20<br />
&gt; other than the rich are not diversifying diets; even the hungry are=20=20<br />
&gt; forced to cut back and are suffering nutritional decline.By 2008,=20=20<br />
&gt; the situation was even worse despite good output.A record 31.5=20=20<br />
&gt; million tonnes of food grains were exported plus added to stocks,=20=20<br />
&gt; reducing domestic cereal supply steeply to 156 kg per head.This=20=20<br />
&gt; happened because the global recession impacted to raise unemployment=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; and food prices spiralled to lower real incomes, so that there was a=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; fresh round of loss of purchasing power.What is to be done?Bold=20=20<br />
&gt; measures are required, not the timid and reluctant half-measures we=20=20<br />
&gt; see.The Mahatma Gandhi National R ural Employment Guarantee Scheme=20=20<br />
&gt; (MGNREGS) needs to be seriously implemented to raise purchasing=20=20<br />
&gt; power and extended to urban areas that have seen a steep rise in=20=20<br />
&gt; poverty.For example, in Delhi State the percentage of persons not=20=20<br />
&gt; able to afford 2100 calories per day rose from 35 to 57 between=20=20<br />
&gt; 1993-4 and 2004-5 and the situation by now is definitely=20=20<br />
&gt; worse.MGNREGS can be used as well for a crash programme of building=20=20<br />
&gt; storage facilities for food grains now rotting in the open.Food=20=20<br />
&gt; distribution through the PDS should be universal, freed from=20=20<br />
&gt; targeting, from the shackles of arbitrary and incorrect official=20=20<br />
&gt; poverty estimates.The recent decision to do away with targeting only=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; in some districts will help very little.The government wishes to=20=20<br />
&gt; restrict the food subsidy but fails to realise that a version of the=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; paradox of thrift operates here as well -- the more it tries to=20=20<br />
&gt; reduce subsidy by restricting access, the more the subsidy will rise=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; uselessly to finance holding unsold food stock s as now.This country=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; can afford to feed all its people at a decent level -- what is=20=20<br />
&gt; holding it back is not lack of resources but ignorant and incorrect=20=20<br />
&gt; ideas.Will the economists at the highest levels of policymaking=20=20<br />
&gt; abjure dogmas and think the problem through rationally?Or will they=20=20<br />
&gt; inflict more punishment on the people, subjecting this country to=20=20<br />

&gt; Calcutta, Sept 12 -- The Trinamul Congress's youth wing today=20=20<br />
&gt; announced a string of programmes in an appare nt bid to counter the=20=20<br />
&gt; Congress's membership drive in the districts that will begin with=20=20<br />
&gt; Rahul Gandhi's three-day trip to the state starting Tuesday.<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; State Trinamul Youth Congress president Subhendu Adhikari, who=20=20<br />
&gt; chaired the party's youth convention in West Midnapore's Sabang=20=20<br />
&gt; today, said: &quot;Didi (Mamata Banerjee) has asked the youth wing to=20=20<br />
&gt; steer our party's anti-CPM programmes till December.&quot;Trinamul=20=20<br />

&gt; party's programmes as it is state Congress chief Manas Bhuniya's=20=20<br />
&gt; constituency.Bhuniya had won the Sabang Assembly constituency in=20=20<br />
&gt; 2006 by a margin of 6,000 votes.&quot;Subhendu's aim was to throw a=20=20<br />
&gt; challenge to Bhuniya who claims to have better organisational clout=20=20<br />
&gt; in Sabang,&quot; a Trinamul secretary said.Several Youth Congress members=20=<br />

&gt; parallel&quot; to those of the Congress's.He said the youth wing of his=20=20<br />
&gt; party had convened &quot;an emergency meeting&quot; of its office bearers at=20=20<br />
&gt; Trinamul Bhavan in Topsia on September 14, the day Rahul begins his=20=20<br />

&gt; workers at West Midnapore's Garbeta, Trinamul will organise a=20=20<br />

=20<br />
&gt; the party, desperate not to yield any political space to the=20=20<br />

&gt; Monday September 13, 2010 10:40:19 GMT<br />
&gt; If you keep repeating half-lies, you will soon start believing=20=20<br />
&gt; them.This is the case with Barack Obama, beleaguered president of=20=20<br />
&gt; the US.With his Democratic party facing a rout at the November=20=20<br />
&gt; elections, Obama is switching to populist mode in domestic politics,=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; where the big concern is jobs.Obama has chosen the outsourcing=20=20<br />
&gt; industry for a bashing.He said, &quot;For years, our tax code has=20=20<br />
&gt; actually given billions of dollars in tax breaks that encourage=20=20<br />
&gt; companies to create jobs and profits in other countries.&quot;Here's our=20=20<br />
&gt; advice: please do withdraw the m, Mr Obama.There are no tax breaks=20=20<br />
&gt; for shipping jobs overseas.What Obama was probably referring to was=20=20<br />
&gt; the tax law which allows US companies to keep the profits made=20=20<br />
&gt; overseas outside.Since these profits are taxed only if they are=20=20<br />
&gt; repatriated to the US, Obama thinks this is a tax break.The truth=20=20<br />
&gt; is, capital is kept where it fetches the highest return.If US=20=20<br />
&gt; companies are offshoring jobs, it is because it is cheaper and more=20=20<br />
&gt; efficient to get these jobs done outside.The profits from these=20=20<br />
&gt; operations are probably better deployed there.If Obama decrees that=20=20<br />
&gt; every dollar earned must be repatriated here and now, so be it.He=20=20<br />
&gt; may earn more taxes in the short run, but offshoring is not going to=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; become less lucrative for that reason.A week earlier, Obama also=20=20<br />
&gt; said that if tax breaks had to be given, he would rather give them=20=20<br />
&gt; to companies that created jobs in America.Once again, he is on the=20=20<br />
&gt; wrong trail.Sure, he can do so.But he should know that it will=20=20<br />
&gt; reward companies that are anyway planning to create jobs --=20=20<br />
&gt; including the same Infosyses and TCSes that are his whipping=20=20<br />
&gt; boys.This is not to say his worries are not real.US unemployment has=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; gone into double-digits and Obama's approval ratings have been=20=20<br />
&gt; steadily falling.To improve his party's standing before the November=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; election, he has to do something.He has already announced billion-=20<br />
&gt; dollar plans to improve infrastructure and give the US economy a=20=20<br />
&gt; fillip.The outsourcing rhetoric is part of the overkill required for=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; reviving his political fortunes.The question for India really is=20=20<br />
&gt; whether to react with outrage or settle for something more muted.The=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; answer is the latter.Outsourcing may be a political football, but it=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; is also an economic dynamo.Kicking the ball back and forth is not=20=20<br />
&gt; going to undo the economic logic driving it all.So let's sit tight=20=20<br />
&gt; and watch the fun.<br />

&gt; Indian Editorial Urges PM Singh To Create Fund for 'Victims of=20=20<br />
&gt; Development'<br />
&gt; Editorial: =7FAnother Way=7F - The Telegraph Online<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; Monday September 13, 2010 10:23:05 GMT<br />
&gt; The prime minister's cabinet is divided on land acquisition for=20=20<br />
&gt; industry, mines, a irports and other &quot;developmental&quot;=20=20<br />
&gt; purposes.Ministers charged with making India an advanced country=20=20<br />
&gt; want to acquire large tracts; the ministry of environment, about the=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; last ministry in the government with powers of licensing, often=20=20<br />
&gt; prevents them from advancing.This has led to a civil war between=20=20<br />
&gt; Jairam Ramesh and other ministers.What the media see is just the=20=20<br />
&gt; skirmishes; the real battles are fought in the cabinet and in file=20=20<br />
&gt; notes.Being at the centre of these battles, the prime minister can=20=20<br />
&gt; hardly have missed the fact that land use is the cause of the=20=20<br />
&gt; deepest rift in his government.He addressed the issue in his press=20=20<br />
&gt; conference with his usual deftness.Since he is an economist, it is=20=20<br />
&gt; not surprising that he leaned towards development and=20=20<br />
&gt; industrialization.He decried the licence-and-permit raj of the=20=20<br />
&gt; environment ministry; but intriguingly, he also advised trade and=20=20<br />
&gt; industry to accept it.This tendency to see merit in opposing=20=20<br />
&gt; positions makes him a good chairman of the cabinet of ministers.But=20=20<br />
&gt; it is also the main factor behind his public image as a mild,=20=20<br />
&gt; unassertive and indecisive prime minister.Neither image does him=20=20<br />
&gt; justice, for he is not a particularly communicative person; what he=20=20<br />
&gt; says gives a rather flat, two-dimensional view of a multifaceted=20=20<br />
&gt; personality.What he said, however, suggests that he has not given=20=20<br />
&gt; adequate attention to the raging controversies around=20=20<br />
&gt; environment.The least that is necessary is to separate the vague and=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; universal issue of environment protection from that of livelihoods=20=20<br />
&gt; and cultures.On the first issue, it is obvious that a country with=20=20<br />
&gt; India's large and rapidly rising population cannot protect pristine=20=20<br />
&gt; environment everywhere.But it can and should protect it somewhere;=20=20<br />
&gt; and there it should give environment effective immunity from human=20=20<br />
&gt; intervention.An example is the protection of tigers.The government=20=20<br />
&gt; has created a number of habitats where they should survive and=20=20<br />
&gt; multiply.But in fact their numbers are inexorably=20=20<br />
&gt; declining.Ineffectual protection is worse than no protection.On the=20=20<br />
&gt; second issue, it may make sense to say that a few primitive tribal=20=20<br />
&gt; people cannot hold up the march of miners into the mountains of=20=20<br />
&gt; central India.But the tribal people see no redress in India's=20=20<br />
&gt; political processes, and have taken to fighting for their=20=20<br />
&gt; habitat.Surely a better solution is required than an assertion of=20=20<br />
&gt; the primacy of development.The prime minister may, on his next trip=20=20<br />
&gt; abroad, profitably make a detour to Alaska, made notorious by Sarah=20=20<br />
&gt; Palin.This state of the United States of America created a fund by=20=20<br />
&gt; putting aside a quarter of royalties on natural resources, to be=20=20<br />
&gt; used to generate income (not to &quot;develop&quot; the state).This Alaska=20=20<br />
&gt; Permanent Fund has grown from $734,000 in 1977 to $35,135,800,000 on=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; September 3. India needs a similar fund, whose use should be decided=20=<br />

&gt; Indian Editorial Criticizes Govt for Reviving 'Colonial Practice' of=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; Caste Census<br />
&gt; Editorial: =7FWhat's the Sense of It?=7F - The Hindu Online<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; Monday September 13, 2010 10:23:04 GMT<br />
&gt; The central argument in favour of caste enumeration has a plausible=20=20<br />
&gt; ri ng to it.Given the strong, if complex, correlation between caste=20=20<br />
&gt; and socio-economic status, the exercise seems to offer the promise=20=20<br />
&gt; of yielding relevant data so that social and economic disparities=20=20<br />
&gt; can be more accurately targeted by policy.On closer analysis, the=20=20<br />
&gt; advantage turns out to be largely illusory.In fact, the political=20=20<br />
&gt; demand for reviving the colonial practice of caste enumeration --=20=20<br />
&gt; given up by independent India except for the Scheduled Castes and=20=20<br />
&gt; the Scheduled Tribes -- has been driven less by ameliorative ideals=20=20<br />
&gt; than by expediency and self-serving, divisive political agendas.At=20=20<br />
&gt; best, fresh caste enumeration can provide only marginal benefits=20=20<br />
&gt; because, as sociologist Nandini Sundar points out, it holds out only=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; an &quot;illusory promise of formal employment.&quot;The long-term societal=20=20<br />
&gt; benefits of reservation -- in terms of making a constitutionally=20=20<br />
&gt; sanctioned statement against social inequality and actually=20=20<br />
&gt; providing educational and economic opportunity to histori cally and=20=20<br />
&gt; socially disadvantaged or oppressed communities -- are there for=20=20<br />
&gt; everyone to see.But with the majority of India's workforce=20=20<br />
&gt; languishing in the informal sector and the state's role in providing=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; jobs declining over the past two decades, it is clear that=20=20<br />
&gt; reservation is becoming less and less potent as a countervailing=20=20<br />
&gt; force.But the objections to the Cabinet's nod for a &quot;focussed,&quot;=20=20<br />
&gt; standalone house-to-house caste headcount between June and September=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; 2011 are not only political-ideological.They are also practical.As=20=20<br />
&gt; any modern sociologist knows, answers to the question, 'What is your=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; caste?' can be notoriously variable, subjective, and influenced by=20=20<br />
&gt; contingent factors.Caste has an elusive arithmetic in a country that=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; is home to a staggering number of sub-castes, where caste names vary=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; depending on context (for marriage or for religious rituals), and=20=20<br />
&gt; where the social implications of a caste tag vary from region to=20=20<br />
&gt; region.Any 21st century caste enumeration that relies on self-=20<br />
&gt; certification will face the same problem encountered by the colonial=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; censuses -- what legal scholar Marc Galanter describes as the=20=20<br />
&gt; &quot;unseemly scramble to use census listings to...inflate numbers for=20=20<br />
&gt; political advantage.&quot;But there is yet another objection, pressed in=20=20<br />
&gt; fact by progressive advocates of caste enumeration in the main=20=20<br />
&gt; census exercise: a standalone headcount of caste will be a &quot;futile&quot;=20=20<br />
&gt; exercise because it will be impossible to integrate it with &quot;the=20=20<br />
&gt; socio-economic, educational and demographic data&quot; gathered during=20=20<br />
&gt; the census headcount.If such integration is ruled out by the=20=20<br />

&gt; Tiankai said here Monday it's important for G20 nations to draw on=20=20<br />
&gt; the experience of developing countries on economic issues and get=20=20<br />
&gt; rid of outdated theories.<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; Cui made the remarks at a panel discussion of the World Economic=20=20<br />

&gt; Summer Davos, in north China's port city of Tianjin.He said half of=20=20<br />
&gt; G20 nations are emerging economies, including six Asian countries,=20=20<br />
&gt; which is a historic step forward for developing economies.The trend=20=20<br />
&gt; of shifting of the global economic development to Asia is going on,=20=20<br />
&gt; and developing economies will continue to make contribution to the=20=20<br />

&gt; of developing countries as a group in recent years, not only China=20=20<br />
&gt; but also others like Indonesia, India and Brazil.Although with the=20=20<br />

&gt; increasingly greater role in regional cooperation.This is a historic=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; development, a more equitable and balanced development, and &quot;we=20=20<br />
&gt; should certainly welcome that,&quot; Cui said.International financial=20=20<br />

&gt; greater representation of African nations and other developing=20=20<br />
&gt; economies in the G20.He said African nations should have more voices=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; heard and other developing countries, including some small island=20=20<br />
&gt; countries, should also have more representation in the G20, even if=20=20<br />
&gt; they may not be a member of the club currently or will not join it=20=20<br />
&gt; in the future.&quot;We have no prejudice against the European countries,=20=20<br />

&gt; of developing countries.Mari Elka Pangestu, Indonesian trade=20=20<br />

&gt; Unattributed report: &quot;We Will Continue Struggle Until Complete=20=20<br />
&gt; Withdrawal Of Indian Army: Salahuddin&quot; - Nawa-e Waqt<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; Monday September 13, 2010 16:08:55 GMT<br />
&gt; Muttahida Jihad Council (MJC), has said that India will be made to=20=20<br />
&gt; pay for every single drop of Kashmiri blood. The Armed struggle=20=20<br />
&gt; would continue as long as there was even one Indian soldier present=20=20<br />
&gt; on Kashmiri soil, he said. Putting Syed Ali Gilani and other=20=20<br />
&gt; Hurriyat freedom leaders under house arrest was condemnable, he=20=20<br />
&gt; said. Use of unlimited force on pea ceful protestors could not end=20=20<br />
&gt; the unremitting struggle, he said. Indian state terrorism had turned=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; occupied Kashmir (Indian- administered Kashmir) into a military=20=20<br />
&gt; state, he said.<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; According to a statement received by Hizbul Mujahidin Spokesperson=20=20<br />
&gt; Ehsan Elahi, an emergency session of the central command council of=20=20<br />
&gt; the organization was headed by Syed Salahuddin, in which the current=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; political and military situation in Jammu and Kashmir was discussed=20=20<br />
&gt; expressing concern over the arrest of all the Hurriyat leaders, and=20=20<br />
&gt; the incidents of firing by Indian Army on innocent Kashmiri people.=20=20<br />
&gt; Addressing the session, Syed Salahuddin said that Hurriyat Chief=20=20<br />
&gt; Syed Ali Gilani was a symbol of Kashmiri freedom movement; he is old=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; and extremely unwell because of physical illnesses, and arresting=20=20<br />
&gt; him in this condition and putting him behind bars was a serious=20=20<br />
&gt; violation of human rights as well as against humanitarian values and=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; morality. His arrest was also a clear proof of the fact that the=20=20<br />
&gt; imperial occupant forces and state administration was scared of this=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; pious and righteous man, Salahuddin said. India is scared that=20=20<br />
&gt; hundreds and thousands of people would be gathered at places=20=20<br />
&gt; arranged to offer 'Id prayers, on the occasion of 'Id al-Fitr, and=20=20<br />
&gt; the freedom movement would get a new zeal and fervor after people=20=20<br />
&gt; listen to his bold speech and instructions, he said. He said that=20=20<br />
&gt; history bear witness that the last Prophet used to release all the=20=20<br />
&gt; prisoners on the occasion of 'Id; even today civilized and cultured=20=20<br />
&gt; nations release political prisoners on their national festivals.=20=20<br />
&gt; However, the Ganges stream of so-called democracy of India flows=20=20<br />
&gt; backwards and unarmed and innocent people were put behind bars over=20=20<br />
&gt; here, he said. Their families were deprived of the joy of 'Id, which=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; was condemnable to the highest extent, he said. Syed Salahuddin said=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; that the barbaric, brutal, and terrorizing attitude which the=20=20<br />
&gt; occupant forces had adopted in the last three months, agains t the=20=20<br />
&gt; defenseless people was extremely alarming and condemnable, and this=20=20<br />
&gt; administrative terrorism had turned the entire state into a military=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; state and had made it difficult for the Kashmiri people to survive.=20=20<br />
&gt; He said: &quot;The bravery, patience, perseverance, determination, and=20=20<br />
&gt; strength displayed by the Kashmiri people is commendable and=20=20<br />
&gt; impressive; we salute them and pay tribute to all those who lost=20=20<br />
&gt; their lives during all this turmoil. Their blood and their sacrifice=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; is a priceless asset of our nation and it is a must for every=20=20<br />
&gt; Kashmiri to honor and appreciate it.&quot; Expressing heartiest sympathy=20=20<br />
&gt; with the relatives of the martyrs and the injured, he said that the=20=20<br />
&gt; sympathies of the whole nation were with the families of the injured=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; and the martyrs, and Hizbul Mujahidin appealed to its honorable=20=20<br />
&gt; nation to celebrate 'Id al-Fitr with simplicity. He said that a new=20=20<br />
&gt; strategy to respond to the brutal and barbaric activities of the=20=20<br />
&gt; Indian Government was also analyzed in this session and the decision=20=<br />

&gt; China's stock market value to top that of U.S. in 2030: Goldman=20=20<br />
&gt; SachsBy Kim Young-gyoHONG KONG, Sept. 13 (Yonhap) -- China's stock=20=20<br />
&gt; market value is expected to surpass that of the United States in=20=20<br />
&gt; 2030 on its rapid economic growth, becoming the world's biggest=20=20<br />
&gt; equity market, Goldman Sachs said Monday.The stock market=20=20<br />
&gt; capitalization of all the listed companies in China will make up 28=20=20<br />
&gt; percent of the world's total stock market value within 20 years,=20=20<br />
&gt; rising from the current 11 percent, the investment bank said.China=20=20<br />
&gt; will be followed by the U.S., India, Japan, Brazil and Russia,=20=20<br />
&gt; according to Goldman Sachs. The market capitalization of the Chinese=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; bourse accounted for 1 percent in 2000.In June, the China Securities=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; Regulatory Commission said China has become the world's third-=20<br />
&gt; largest stock market, 30 years after the country established a=20=20<br />
&gt; bourse.China's first stock market was set up in the southern city of=20=<br />

&gt; 2003, the commission said. Some 2,300 companies are listed on the=20=20<br />
&gt; Chinese markets.Goldman Sachs also said that the combined value of=20=20<br />
&gt; stock markets in the emerging economies, including China, India,=20=20<br />
&gt; Russia and Brazil, will likely expand five-fold to $80 trillion in=20=20<br />

&gt; Island Online<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; Monday September 13, 2010 11:50:24 GMT<br />
&gt; Sri Lanka needs to closely watch the Indo-Lanka maritime boundary to=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; thwart any future attempt to re-establish a clandestine sea line of=20=20<br />
&gt; communications between northern Sri Lanka and India.Maintaining=20=20<br />
&gt; surveillance on the Indian fishing fleet, as well as the local=20=20<br />
&gt; fishing population is essentially one of the most important factors=20=20<br />
&gt; in the overall naval strategy in a post-war era.Although the LTTE no=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; longer posed a conventional military threat, Sri Lanka shouldn't be=20=20<br />
&gt; complacent, Navy Commander Vice Admiral T.S.G. Samarasinghe said.<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; The navy vete ran went on to say that patrolling the seas is a=20=20<br />
&gt; formidable task, particularly in view of the ever increasing=20=20<br />
&gt; poaching by the Indian fishing fleet.In his presentation to the=20=20<br />
&gt; Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission (LLRC), he discussed=20=20<br />
&gt; both post and pre-war security scenarios in relation to naval=20=20<br />
&gt; operations, with the emphasis on humanitarian operations undertaken=20=20<br />
&gt; by the navy.<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; Producing technical and photographic evidence, Vice Admiral=20=20<br />
&gt; Samarasinghe explained that the LTTE had cleverly exploited the=20=20<br />
&gt; Indian fishing fleet to its advantage.The navy chief said that the=20=20<br />
&gt; LTTE never suspended its clandestine sea line of communications,=20=20<br />
&gt; even during the Norwegian-arranged CFA.He recalled the detection of=20=20<br />
&gt; an Indian trawler in Sri Lankan waters on February 6, 2003, carrying=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; arms and ammunition.<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; Vice Admiral Samarasinghe said that at the time of the detection,=20=20<br />
&gt; there had been a Nordic member of the Sri Lanka Monitoring Mission=20=20<br />
&gt; (SLMM) onboard one of the SLN Fast Attack Cra ft (FAC) involved.The=20=20<br />
&gt; navy chief said: &quot;...as we suspected this Indian trawler, we got the=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; SLMM member to get on the trawler where he recovered ammunition and=20=20<br />
&gt; a 20 or 30 mm weapon.Those onboard the trawler threatened the SLMM=20=20<br />
&gt; member, forcing him to jump overboard.Although we rescued the=20=20<br />
&gt; foreigner, the LTTE blew up the trawler to avoid being apprehended.&quot;<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; Commenting on the formidable threat posed by the Sea Tigers on naval=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; movements, particularly between Trincomalee and Kankesanthurai=20=20<br />
&gt; during the Eelam war IV, Vice Admiral Samarasinghe said that a=20=20<br />
&gt; substantial force had to be deployed to protect the troop carrier,=20=20<br />
&gt; Jetliner, which also accommodated civilians.<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; The navy had to deploy two Offshore Patrol Vessels (OPVs), one Fast=20=20<br />
&gt; Gun Boat (FGB), 20 Fast Attack Craft (FACs), 22 Arrow Boats, two=20=20<br />
&gt; Inshore Patrol Craft (IPCs), one Mi 24 helicopter gunship and one=20=20<br />
&gt; Beech craft.The army placed artillery pieces along the coast on=20=20<br />
&gt; alert to provide gun fire support in c ase of an attack.<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; Vice Admiral Samarasinghe explained the difficulties faced by the=20=20<br />
&gt; men in policing waters, not only in north-eastern waters, but north-=20<br />
&gt; western waters as well.<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; Vice Admiral Samarasinghe said that had the war lasted, LTTE=20=20<br />
&gt; underwater fighting craft (submersibles) would have posed a grave=20=20<br />
&gt; threat.According to him, the LTTE had carried out its first suicide=20=20<br />
&gt; attack on an SLN vessel on May 4, 1991, in the Jaffna peninsula.He=20=20<br />
&gt; briefly explained the gradual LTTE build-up leading to the three-=20<br />
&gt; year-Eelam war.<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; The war ended on May 19 last year.<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; Vice Admiral Samarasinghe said that throughout the war the=20=20<br />
&gt; government maintained a sea line of communication to the Jaffna=20=20<br />
&gt; peninsula, though the government lost the overland supply route in=20=20<br />
&gt; 1990.<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; According to the navy chief, there had been 300 ship loads of=20=20<br />
&gt; supplies sent for the civilians living in the Jaffna peninsula=20=20<br />
&gt; during the three-year long military offensive.The Commissioner=20=20<br />
&gt; General of Essen tial Services had handled this daunting task to=20=20<br />
&gt; move about 100 ship loads annually, Vice Admiral Samarasinghe said.<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; During this period the government also provided safe sea passage to=20=20<br />
&gt; over 200,000 civilians to move to and from the Jaffna peninsula.<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; Vice Admiral Samarasinghe said: &quot;We never isolated the North from=20=20<br />
&gt; the South during the war,&quot; proudly declaring the navy maintained a=20=20<br />
&gt; sea line of communications throughout the war despite repeated S ea=20=20<br />
&gt; Tiger attacks.<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; During Eelam war IV ships carrying food and fuel for civilians=20=20<br />
&gt; didn't have ICRC protection<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; Vice Admiral Samarasinghe said that Sri Lanka ensured the safety of=20=20<br />
&gt; ships passing Sri Lanka.According to him about 150 ships take this=20=20<br />
&gt; route every day.<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; He recalled the LTTE attempts to cripple Galle and Colombo harbors=20=20<br />
&gt; at the height of the war.<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; On the directions of the government, the navy despite a threat posed=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; by the LTTE, had brought large generators to Kankesanthurai and mov=20=20<br />
&gt; ed them to Chunnakam to ensure uninterrupted power supply to the=20=20<br />
&gt; people of Jaffna.KKS had to be used, though it was not equipped to=20=20<br />
&gt; accommodate heavy cargo as the government was in a hurry to provide=20=20<br />
&gt; electricity, the navy chief said.<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; He emphasized the importance of keeping sea lines of communications=20=20<br />
&gt; despite LTTE either destroying or damaging ships carrying cargo to=20=20<br />
&gt; the north.<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; Vice Admiral Samarasinghe said that the international community=20=20<br />
&gt; never took tangible action against the LTTE, though it targeted=20=20<br />
&gt; ships.The seizure of Farah III is a case in point, he said, adding=20=20<br />
&gt; that the navy had to hunt down the 'LTTE floating arsenals' on the=20=20<br />
&gt; high seas after the LTTE shifted its major operations from India to=20=20<br />
&gt; several other countries in the region.<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; Ten LTTE vessels destroyed by the navy, had International Maritime=20=20<br />
&gt; Organization's numbers, the navy Commander said adding that had the=20=20<br />
&gt; international community investigated, it could have identified those=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; who registered the vessels.<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; During the period LTTE floating arms warehouses were destroyed he=20=20<br />
&gt; was the Director General Operations and Commander Eastern Naval=20=20<br />
&gt; Area, from 2006 to 2008.<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; The navy chief revealed that the navy had lost seven FACs each worth=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; $ 7 million and 13 merchant vessels during the fourth phase.He went=20=20<br />
&gt; on to explain the circumstances in which the LTTE had attacked a=20=20<br />
&gt; cargo vessel as late as November 22, 2008, using a semi-submersible=20=20<br />
&gt; craft packed with explosives.<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; Of the seven FACs lost in action, the last was on January 19, 2009,=20=20<br />
&gt; off Mullattivu.<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; Commenting on the last stage of the ground offensive, Vice Admiral=20=20<br />
&gt; Samarasinghe said that over 700 boats carrying people, had escaped=20=20<br />
&gt; from areas under LTTE control as the army advanced towards the=20=20<br />
&gt; Mullattivu coast.He explained the deployment of high tech equipment=20=20<br />
&gt; to identify LTTE craft trying to exploit the civilian exodus to its=20=20<br />
&gt; advantage.Touching on the measures taken by the navy to help=20=20<br />
&gt; civilians, Vice Admiral Samarasinghe said that the enemy=20=20<br />
&gt; successfully targeted two SLN vessels (small boats) taking cover of=20=20<br />
&gt; civilians, though the navy reacted cautiously without resorting to=20=20<br />
&gt; indiscriminate fire.<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; We lost two vessels in attacks carried out by the LTTE taking=20=20<br />
&gt; advantage of civilians, though they expected the navy to fire=20=20<br />
&gt; indiscriminately we never did that.<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; Getting back to the Indian issue, Vice Admiral Samarasinghe said=20=20<br />
&gt; that over 500 Indian fishing craft poach in Sri Lankan waters on=20=20<br />
&gt; Mondays, Wednesdays and Thursdays.Their presence could be exploited=20=20<br />
&gt; by terrorists, Vice Admiral Samarasinghe said, while recalling how=20=20<br />
&gt; the Sea Tigers had used Indian fishing fleet as a cover to operate=20=20<br />
&gt; across the Indo-Lanka maritime boundary and then take refuge among=20=20<br />
&gt; fishing villages along the north-western coast north of Mannar.The=20=20<br />
&gt; navy chief said that they had not been able to attack Sea Tiger=20=20<br />
&gt; craft after they reached the land due to the presence of civilians.<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; The officer told the LLRC identifying terrorists operating among=20=20<br />
&gt; fishermen was a tremendous task.<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; The navy chief recalled the LTTE suicide attack on a Dvora FAC (P=20=20<br />
&gt; 413) on Dec 26th 2007, just two nautical miles from the Indo-Lanka=20=20<br />
&gt; maritime boundary.Of the 14-man crew, only one survived.A grave=20=20<br />
&gt; looking navy chief said that fighting suicide cadres was mentally=20=20<br />
&gt; difficult task. &quot;Those operating suicide boats may miss their=20=20<br />
&gt; targets.Then they will have to come back again.&quot;He said.He called=20=20<br />
&gt; the navy, who operated in what he called suicide craft infested=20=20<br />
&gt; waters, as gallant and co urageous men.<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; He emphasized the importance of a permanent blockade of the=20=20<br />
&gt; clandestine Indian route to thwart any eventuality.The navy chief=20=20<br />
&gt; explained measures adopted by the navy to ensure local fishermen=20=20<br />
&gt; could not engage in nefarious activities.Setting up of fishing=20=20<br />
&gt; marshalling points had helped the close monitoring of local boats in=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; and out of Sri Lanka, he said, adding, however, that illegal=20=20<br />
&gt; movements still take place.<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; Vice Admiral Samarasinghe said that in the post-war era there could=20=20<br />
&gt; be serious disputes between Sri Lankan and Indian fishermen due to=20=20<br />
&gt; Indians poaching in Sri Lankan waters.He alleged that the situation=20=20<br />
&gt; had been worsened by the use of illegal fishing methods by the=20=20<br />
&gt; Indians.<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; He explained efforts taken by the navy on the Defense Ministry=20=20<br />
&gt; instructions, to gather data on all fishermen in a bid to meet their=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; needs.Banks had been brought in to provide help to local fishermen=20=20<br />
&gt; and since the end of the war the fish production has increased.<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; Commenting on the last stages of the battle, the navy chief said=20=20<br />
&gt; that overland supply convoys had to be suspended on January 21,=20=20<br />
&gt; 2009, due to heavy fighting.<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; &quot;The ICRC facilitated the effort obviously because the terrorists=20=20<br />
&gt; too agreed for their role.Beginning February 1, we moved food and=20=20<br />
&gt; medicine to the gradually shrinking area under LTTE control and=20=20<br />
&gt; brought back the sick and the wounde d, including LTTE sympathizers=20=20<br />
&gt; and LTTE cadres.&quot;Vice Admiral Samarasinghe appreciated the support=20=20<br />
&gt; given by India to take care of those arriving in Pullmoddai.The=20=20<br />
&gt; Indian government deployed medical teams in support during the final=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; phase of the fighting and then moved them to Vavuniya to help look=20=20<br />
&gt; after the war displaced.<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; The navy chief praised Tamil public servants, who helped the navy's=20=20<br />
&gt; efforts to bring in supplies and distribute them in Jaffna.He=20=20<br />
&gt; especially thanked Jaffna GA Ganesh and Tamil civilians from=20=20<br />
&gt; Karainagar and other coastal villages who had helped unload ships=20=20<br />
&gt; under tremendous difficulties during the war.<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; The navy went to the extent of deploying the Jetliner and FACs to=20=20<br />
&gt; transport civilians, sick and the wounded, regardless of regulations.<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; The navy chief recalled LTTE attacks on ships and how the LTTE had=20=20<br />
&gt; trapped two FACs which had moved to assist Irish Mona in LTTE waters.<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; The navy chief reminded the LLRC steps taken by security forces=20=20<br />
&gt; during the war to prevent attempts to smuggle bombs and explosives=20=20<br />
&gt; in to ships carrying food to the north.Ships taking goods to the=20=20<br />
&gt; North had to be checked thoroughly to thwart attempts to load bombs=20=20<br />
&gt; with supplies to destroy vessels.<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; Vice Admiral Samarasinghe emphasized the importance of deploying=20=20<br />
&gt; what he called onboard security teams to protect ships vulnerable to=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; attack.The vessels carrying supplies for civilian in the Jaffna=20=20<br />
&gt; peninsula had such teams onboard to help thwart LTTE attacks, he=20=20<br />
&gt; said, adding that Sri Lanka had suggested to the UN that onboard=20=20<br />
&gt; security units could be the answer to the threat posed by pirates.<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; Vice Admiral Samarasinghe said that protection of harbors had been=20=20<br />
&gt; of critical importance to sustain the war against terrorism.Had they=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; succeeded in disturbing harbor activity it would have caused an=20=20<br />
&gt; irreparable damage to the war effort, he said.<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; Although the navy had to prohibit fishing in some areas in the=20=20<br />
&gt; northern and eastern provinces as part of overall security measures,=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; particularly to enhance security of harbors and other coastal=20=20<br />
&gt; installations, action was taken to allow fishing under the=20=20<br />
&gt; supervision of the navy.The restrictions particularly affected the=20=20<br />
&gt; fishing community in the North, he said, since the conclusion of the=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; war there had been a marked improvement in fishing activity.<br />

&gt; The three lions on our emblem stand as metaphors for the three=20=20<br />
&gt; haqiqat that prevail in India -- awaam, siyaasat and hukumat.These=20=20<br />
&gt; three -- the people of India, India's political life, and the Indian=20=<br />

&gt; quot;The answer was, &quot;Some god.&quot;If an average Indian were asked=20=20<br />

&gt; and loops, grows.And it often becomes oblique.Psychological violence=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; continues to be encountered by vulnerable women.Commercial=20=20<br />
&gt; endorsements by our superstars of so-called skin-lighteners increase=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; the vulnerability of girls in our colour-prejudiced society.An=20=20<br />
&gt; excellent new law has shown a return fist to domestic violence.But=20=20<br />
&gt; that villain is yet to see the strong arm of the law.Does the sense=20=20<br />
&gt; of security in our minority communities, especially among their=20=20<br />
&gt; poorer sections, grow?If there is a real sense of insecurity among=20=20<br />
&gt; vulnerable sections of minority communities, it can be found inter=20=20<br />
&gt; se within those com munities as well as by liberals, dissenters and=20=20<br />
&gt; nonconformists.Javed Akhtar is his own person.All of us know what=20=20<br />
&gt; that frank man has experienced.Intolerance, of course, is no=20=20<br />
&gt; monopoly of theologies.It is to be found in political communities=20=20<br />
&gt; too, where a difference of opinion can lead to excommunication,=20=20<br />
&gt; papal style.The active Indian liberal questions, objects and raises=20=20<br />
&gt; a finger to protest because in a liberal society that is the natural=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; thing to do.And when he does that he can court danger.If an Indian=20=20<br />
&gt; who RTIs a department or a project and gets his answer, he is a=20=20<br />
&gt; persevering querist.But when he pays for his perseverance with his=20=20<br />
&gt; life, our liberal and open democracy stands brazenly=20=20<br />
&gt; assaulted.Except when traumas such as regularly witnessed in Kashmir=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; and the one that has agonized Manipur for so long, and except when=20=20<br />
&gt; the chronic enervations of tribal and Dalit India rapidly move from=20=20<br />
&gt; individual to collective rage, the prominent mood of Awaam-e-Hind is=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; that of pained dejectio n and cynical resignation, a 'who cares?'-=20<br />
&gt; ness. Siyaasat-e-Hind<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; Like so much else, money grows in our beloved land: it rules like=20=20<br />
&gt; &quot;some god&quot;.It rules through the moneyed man, but even more through=20=20<br />
&gt; the moneying or monetizing of our lives.In 1950, deposits -- simple=20=20<br />
&gt; bank accounts -- in India amounted to Rs 888 crore.Today, they=20=20<br />
&gt; amount to over Rs 750, 000 crore.In 1950, the currency in=20=20<br />
&gt; circulation in India was Rs 1,247 crore.Today it is Rs 5,17,434=20=20<br />
&gt; crore.And we are talking of accounted money.But there is something=20=20<br />
&gt; even more important about money in India than its growth -- its=20=20<br />
&gt; enhanced availability, its heightened visibility.And that is the=20=20<br />
&gt; change in its role and action.Money is no longer just an instrument=20=20<br />
&gt; of exchange; it is now a device for delivery.Money can secure=20=20<br />
&gt; employment, admissions, promotions, preferments, transfers,=20=20<br />
&gt; exonerations.It can create delays, spur speed.Money can permeate=20=20<br />
&gt; that which was until only the other day the preserve of pure=20=20<br />
&gt; enjoyment -- sport.Cricket is today as much about money as it is=20=20<br />
&gt; about the gentleman's game -- we can call it Mocket or Croney.It can=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; threaten to tarnish the izzat and imaan of our nation's collective=20=20<br />
&gt; integrity by appearing like pustules on a global sports event.Money=20=20<br />
&gt; can and does do worse.It can abduct, assault.It can finance hurt, it=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; can fund harm, it can injure and manage to look injured.It can=20=20<br />
&gt; purchase death.There is another thing that is growing in its spread=20=20<br />
&gt; and strength and may be said to be trying to 'rule' India.And which=20=20<br />
&gt; contributes not to cynical resignation, but to fear and anxiety.And=20=20<br />
&gt; that 'thing' is, with narcotics, a close cousin of money: namely,=20=20<br />
&gt; the illegal small firearm.India has not one million, not four=20=20<br />
&gt; million, not 10 million but, at a conservative estimate, 40 million=20=20<br />
&gt; illegal small arms floating around all over the land.Mischief, of=20=20<br />
&gt; course, does not come from illegal arms alone.The incidents of=20=20<br />
&gt; police or paramilitary firings and encounters, which have later been=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; judged unjustified and unlawful, have been around the use of legal=20=20<br />
&gt; arms.So, going beyond the phenomenon of illegal arms in India, the=20=20<br />
&gt; question to ponder is the larger one of weapons and the 'culture' of=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; weapons entering the bloodstream of our lives.It has done so in some=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; parts of India devastatingly.Elections are our pride.The Election=20=20<br />
&gt; Commission deserves our approbation for monumental patience, above=20=20<br />
&gt; all else, in the manner in which it keeps its cool, stays the course=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; with the election laws, and after the catharsis of polling and=20=20<br />
&gt; counting, delivers the mandate which we have defined in the=20=20<br />
&gt; assurance of confidentiality, fairness and freedom.But the=20=20<br />
&gt; commission knows better than others how money, authorized and=20=20<br />
&gt; unauthorized, and human biceps and triceps, authorized in the armed=20=20<br />
&gt; personnel billeted to election duty and unauthorized in others, can=20=20<br />
&gt; play a role in the proceedings.Currency notes come into the election=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; bazaar first in container and cargo quantities, then in truckloads ,=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; going into wholesale, small retail and finally in attache, thaila,=20=20<br />
&gt; jhola and jeb-sized portions every five years at the least and often=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; oftener than that.They originate either legally, through licit=20=20<br />
&gt; company donations, or come from a myriad sources which, as Amit=20=20<br />
&gt; Bhaduri explained recently to a Chennai audience, necessarily and=20=20<br />
&gt; unavoidably go back to our natural resources such as mines, forests=20=20<br />
&gt; and land.Illegal transactions in all these yield harvests of black=20=20<br />
&gt; cash.I wish the Reserve Bank of India depicted on the large=20=20<br />
&gt; denominations of our currency any person from the scroll of our=20=20<br />
&gt; great kings and emperors who commanded mints and treasuries or,=20=20<br />
&gt; better still, chose non-human images.But if it had to carry the=20=20<br />
&gt; likeness of Mahatma Gandhi, I wish it did so only on the coin of the=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; smallest denomination, the one rupee coin which cannot cover large,=20=20<br />
&gt; inappropriate and concealed transactions of money for, among other=20=20<br />
&gt; dubious uses, the buying and selling of weapons of murder.I believe=20=20<br />
&gt; the time has come for the laws in respect of the funding of our=20=20<br />
&gt; elections to be brought bravely a nd transparently under the public=20=20<br />
&gt; scanner once again, focused on the working of Section 293A of the=20=20<br />
&gt; Companies Act.But going beyond study, hard and exemplary action=20=20<br />
&gt; needs to be taken by those who are empowered to do so, whenever and=20=20<br />
&gt; wherever funds in excess of permissible quantums are patently=20=20<br />
&gt; employed.Simultaneously, the government and political parties should=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; hearken to the public mood and disengage senior politicians, and=20=20<br />
&gt; certainly those who are in public office, from responsibilities in=20=20<br />
&gt; cash-rich sports federations.Their dual charge can only be to the=20=20<br />
&gt; detriment of either the sport or of the public office concerned.The=20=20<br />
&gt; public is no fool; it knows who is where for what.Our new chief=20=20<br />
&gt; election commissioner's determined statement to the effect that he=20=20<br />
&gt; will address the question of money in elections is therefore deeply=20=20<br />
&gt; satisfying and hope-giving.We need to redeem our elections fro m the=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; vice-like grip over it of money, for elections are precious to us,=20=20<br />
&gt; as is money in its rightful place and role.And, indeed, every licit=20=20<br />
&gt; firearm in the defence of the country and the protection of its=20=20<br />
&gt; people.Our political spectrum diffuses the unpolluted beam of hope=20=20<br />
&gt; as it passes through the waters of political choice into a million=20=20<br />
&gt; competing colours.Our society is splintered into majority-minority,=20=20<br />
&gt; minority-sub-minority, community-sub-community, caste-sub-caste, and=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; avarna-savarna.But the opportunistic exploitation of that=20=20<br />
&gt; splintering disgraces Siyaasat-e-Hind.The latest form of this=20=20<br />
&gt; exploitation is the retrieval, suddenly from a forgotten past, of=20=20<br />
&gt; the splintering splinter of splintered splinters -- namely, gotra-=20<br />
&gt; sagotra being imposed on couples by village venerables.Even in his=20=20<br />
&gt; most pessimistic contemplations of the Hindu code bill, B.R.=20=20<br />
&gt; Ambedkar could not have imagined that 60 years after India's=20=20<br />
&gt; becoming a republic it would see honour killings in the name of this=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; ata vistic recoil.Which brings me to the last of the three 'sher'.=20=20<br />
&gt; Hukumat-e-Hind The legislators of India, our lawmakers, have given=20=20<br />
&gt; to us constitutional amendments, notably the 73rd and 74th, and=20=20<br />
&gt; several new law enactments, which have changed India's life=20=20<br />
&gt; rhythms.Some of the finest, most humanitarian, compassionate and=20=20<br />
&gt; even revolutionary laws that protect the weak, the jeopardized, and=20=20<br />
&gt; the vulnerable, especially women, have come from the community of=20=20<br />
&gt; India's politicians.When we despair of the politics of individual=20=20<br />
&gt; politicians we must remember this larger picture.It is also notable=20=20<br />
&gt; that it is our Parliament that has enabled the enemy property bill,=20=20<br />
&gt; meant to replace an ordinance with the same incredible title, and=20=20<br />
&gt; has put it on hold for further examination.My faith in the destiny=20=20<br />
&gt; of Indian self-correction has been strengthened by the news that=20=20<br />
&gt; there is serious rethinking going on about it.Another piece of=20=20<br />
&gt; legislation before our Parliament has been powered by world=20=20<br />
&gt; opinion.It is a bill to restrain the monster called torture.We=20=20<br />
&gt; should be making torture impossible.Instead, the bill raises the bar=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; of the definition of torture, thereby indemnifying such acts as=20=20<br />
&gt; leave no mark on the individual's body.Obviously, those who have=20=20<br />
&gt; vetted this bill are unaware of certain pieces of furniture and=20=20<br />
&gt; appliances in lock-ups, and of the infinite possibilities of the=20=20<br />
&gt; spoken word.I trust the bill will reverse all attempts to let=20=20<br />
&gt; torture slip through definitional openings.The Indian policeman,=20=20<br />
&gt; too, does not make an easy hero and the dictionary of swear words is=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; far too accessible to him.But let us also acknowledge the fact that=20=20<br />
&gt; he, too, is the easy butt of jokes in our free country.In how many=20=20<br />
&gt; countries are policemen shown in a negative light as in our cinema,=20=20<br />
&gt; stories, even in our media?So, I would like to believe that the day=20=20<br />
&gt; will come when a policeman passing by a thhelawala will not send=20=20<br />
&gt; shivers down the poor vendor's spine, nor an income tax inspector's=20=20<br />
&gt; unexpected v isit cause the shop assistant in a commercial=20=20<br />
&gt; establishment to go running to arrange chai.I would like to believe=20=20<br />
&gt; that the day will come when a decent chair with a backrest and=20=20<br />
&gt; armrests replaces the interrogation seat beneath a naked bulb.The=20=20<br />
&gt; day will come -- not very far from now, I am sure -- when the civil=20=20<br />
&gt; and police administrations will be able to draw a distinction=20=20<br />
&gt; between civil rights activists, writers and sociologists on the one=20=20<br />
&gt; hand and those who are waging a war against the Indian State on the=20=20<br />
&gt; other, when no tribal person is presumed to be a Naxal, or his home=20=20<br />
&gt; to be a Naxal hideout, and his land a 'territory lost to Maoist=20=20<br />
&gt; influence', leading to the innocent man or woman's interrogation and=20=<br />
=20<br />

&gt; Indian PM says 'grievances' of Kashmiri youth need to be addressed -=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; PTI News Agency<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; Monday September 13, 2010 11:18:56 GMT<br />
&gt; Text of report by Indian news agency PTINew Delhi, 13 September:=20=20<br />
&gt; Voicing concern over the unrest in Jammu and Kashmir (Indian-=20<br />
&gt; administered Kashmir), Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Si ngh on=20=20<br />
&gt; Monday (13 September) sought to reach out to the people there,=20=20<br />
&gt; saying their grievances have to be addressed and promised talks=20=20<br />
&gt; within the Indian constitution with those who abjure violence.As his=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; government weighs options to deal with the situation in Kashmir,=20=20<br />
&gt; Singh emphasized the need for better delivery of services and=20=20<br />
&gt; generating avenues for economic advancement of the people of the=20=20<br />
&gt; state.&quot;Unrest in the state of Jammu and Kashmir over the last few=20=20<br />
&gt; weeks is a matter of concern.The youth of Kashmir are our citizens=20=20<br />
&gt; and their grievances have to be addressed,&quot; he told top commanders=20=20<br />
&gt; of the armed forces at a conference here.&quot;We are willing to talk to=20=20<br />
&gt; every person or group which abjures violence, within the framework=20=20<br />
&gt; of our constitution,&quot; he said.Singh, however, made no mention of the=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; controversial Armed Forces Special Powers Act (Act), whose=20=20<br />
&gt; withdrawal from the state is being sought by Chief Minister Omar=20=20<br />
&gt; Abdullah.The prime minister is expected to dis cuss this issue at=20=20<br />
&gt; the Cabinet Committee on Security.Army, supported by Defence=20=20<br />
&gt; Minister A.K. Antony, is strongly opposed to the revocation or=20=20<br />
&gt; dilution of the law, arguing that the situation in the state was not=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; conducive for such a step.Antony had articulated these views at the=20=20<br />
&gt; Congress Core Committee meeting chaired by party chief Sonia Gandhi=20=20<br />
&gt; last Friday.The group was divided on the issue, with Home Minister=20=20<br />
&gt; P. Chidambaram backing the proposal for partial withdrawal of the=20=20<br />
&gt; special law that gives sweeping powers and immunity to the security=20=20<br />
&gt; personnel.Hailing the security forces for securing the nation's=20=20<br />
&gt; interest, apart from disaster mitigation, the prime minister said=20=20<br />
&gt; the armed forces &quot;deserve the best&quot; and assured them of government's=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; support to ensure this.&quot;Our armed forces deserve the best and I wish=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; to assure you that the government will make every effort to ensure=20=20<br />
&gt; this.No country can make progress without ensuring its security and=20=20<br />
&gt; territorial integrity, &quot; he said.Asking the defence forces to set=20=20<br />
&gt; higher standards for their modernization in view of economy growing=20=20<br />
&gt; and technological capabilities expanding, Singh said: &quot;It is not=20=20<br />
&gt; enough for us to keep pace with change.When it comes to defence=20=20<br />
&gt; capability, we must be ahead of the technology curve.&quot;Terming=20=20<br />
&gt; defence modernization as &quot;a complex task,&quot; Singh said: &quot;If it is to=20=20<br />
&gt; be effective, it must involve the full chain, starting with updating=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; our war-fighting doctrines to meet new threats to our security,=20=20<br />
&gt; preparation of appropriate staff quality requirements and creating a=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; broad-based production and delivery infrastructure on the=20=20<br />
&gt; ground.&quot;Noting that border infrastructure was an integral part of=20=20<br />
&gt; defence preparedness, he said this involved not just the land=20=20<br />
&gt; borders, but also ensuring appropriate coastal security for which=20=20<br />
&gt; several measures had been initiated.&quot;But it is important that all=20=20<br />
&gt; ministries and departments work in close coordination to en sure=20=20<br />
&gt; timely implementation of existing plans.It is necessary to approach=20=20<br />
&gt; this task with a sense of urgency,&quot; he added.Describing naxalism=20=20<br />
&gt; (Maoism) as &quot;a serious challenge&quot; to internal security, the prime=20=20<br />
&gt; minister said the government would do all that was necessary to=20=20<br />
&gt; protect each and every citizen of the country and deal firmly with=20=20<br />
&gt; those who resorted to violence.&quot;This is a collective task involving=20=20<br />
&gt; the Centre (federal government) and the states.At the same time, we=20=20<br />
&gt; have to accelerate our development efforts in the naxal-affected=20=20<br />
&gt; areas and make our administrative machinery more sensitive and=20=20<br />
&gt; responsive to local concerns,&quot; he added.Pointing out that the=20=20<br />
&gt; nation's strength flowed from the strength of its institutions,=20=20<br />
&gt; values and economic competitiveness, Singh said if India was looked=20=20<br />
&gt; upon today with respect and seen as a force for the future, it was=20=20<br />
&gt; because of the stable and orderly fashion in which the country was=20=20<br />
&gt; transforming the lives of its people. &quot;Transformation on such a=20=20<br />
&gt; scale, within the framework of a democratic and pluralistic society,=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; has not been seen in the world before.If we succeed, our example=20=20<br />
&gt; will have repercussions for the new global order,&quot; he=20=20<br />
&gt; added.Emphasizing the country's &quot;strategic autonomy&quot;, Singh said it=20=20<br />
&gt; was &quot;an article of faith&quot; and India was &quot;too large a country to be=20=20<br />
&gt; boxed into any alliance or regional or sub-regional arrangements,=20=20<br />
&gt; whether trade, economic or political.&quot;He said if India had to=20=20<br />
&gt; sustain its nine to 10 per cent growth, it needed foreign capital=20=20<br />
&gt; inflow, both portfolio and direct investment, the best of modern=20=20<br />
&gt; technology and access to markets of the advanced economies, and the=20=20<br />
&gt; country had to modernize its infrastructure.For all this, India=20=20<br />
&gt; needed to maintain healthy relations with all major powers, he=20=20<br />
&gt; added.On the global terms, the prime minister said there was a shift=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; of economic and political power to Asia, with the Asia Pacific=20=20<br />
&gt; region, includ ing the Southeast Asia, needing more attention from=20=20<br />
&gt; India.&quot;This must seep into our defence and foreign policy planning=20=20<br />
&gt; as never before.This is a palpable desire on the part of the=20=20<br />
&gt; countries of this region to enhance cooperation with us, which we=20=20<br />
&gt; must reciprocate,&quot; he added.Noting that some of the &quot;toughest=20=20<br />
&gt; challenges&quot; lay in India's neighbourhood, Singh said the country=20=20<br />
&gt; would not realize its growth ambitions unless peace and stability=20=20<br />
&gt; was ensured in South Asia.Describing the nations of the Gulf region,=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; West and Central Asia as &quot;natural partners&quot;, he said India had=20=20<br />
&gt; tangible interests in these regions, among which energy security was=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; most important.&quot;We have to ensure adequate availability of=20=20<br />
&gt; commercial energy to support our growth targets.This requires not=20=20<br />
&gt; only diversification of the sources of our energy imports but also=20=20<br />
&gt; widening of our overall energy mix.It is in this context that we=20=20<br />
&gt; need to operationalize our nuclear energy option, which h olds great=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; promise and is a necessity,&quot; he added.Referring to the global=20=20<br />
&gt; economic crisis of 2008, Singh said India had weathered it better=20=20<br />
&gt; than most large economies, as there was a continental-sized economy=20=20<br />
&gt; and large internal market.But the challenge, he said, would be to=20=20<br />
&gt; ensure that growth was balanced across all regions and reached all=20=20<br />
&gt; sections of society.&quot;Given our youth demographic profile, we will=20=20<br />
&gt; also have to ensure access to good quality education and health=20=20<br />
&gt; services to all.We have to put in place a National Skill Development=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; Mission to empower our youth which will yield positive results,&quot; he=20=20<br />
&gt; added.Singh also assured the armed forces that the country would=20=20<br />
&gt; accord priority to equipment, training and welfare of soldiers and=20=20<br />
&gt; retired defence personnel.&quot;We will do all that is necessary to=20=20<br />
&gt; ensure the armed forces attract the best talent in the country,&quot; he=20=20<br />

&gt; There were just 15 inmates there for around 6 months then, and now=20=20<br />
&gt; it is the biggest camp out of all 117 camps in Tamil Nadu. This camp=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; has 3,823 heads belonging to 1,073 families now. Most of these=20=20<br />
&gt; inmates are hard-core Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (L TTE)=20=20<br />

&gt; fake Passports generation quarter by innumerable LTTE terrorists=20=20<br />

&gt; private rented houses with due permission from government=20=20<br />

&gt;<br />
&gt; The report adds that there is a full-fledged police station in front=20=<br />

&gt; Report Says Rameswaram Fishermen Buy Refurbished Boats Decertified=20=20<br />
&gt; by Kerala Government Dinamalar<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; online of 12 September in Tamil carries an approximately 600-word=20=20<br />
&gt; report entitled: &quot;Rameswaram fishermen purchase at very low price=20=20<br />
&gt; refurbished and reconstructed Kerala-manufactured fishing boats=20=20<br />
&gt; decertified by Kerala government - This is the cause of all woes of=20=20<br />
&gt; Rameswaram fishermen in mid seas - Tamil Nadu Fisheries Department=20=20<br />
&gt; officer laments in Rameswaram.&quot; The report says that as applicable=20=20<br />
&gt; to vehicles, motorized fishing boats have a prescribed period of=20=20<br />
&gt; life, after which the Fisheries Department withdraws license for the=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; boats that should be scrapped by fishermen. Since every boat costs=20=20<br />
&gt; nearly Rs.100,000, poor fishermen continue to use life-expired=20=20<br />
&gt; boats. There are innumerable boat-manufacturing yards in Kerala.=20=20<br />
&gt; These boatyards repair, refurbish, and refit old boats and make them=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; sea-worthy, and sell them to Tamil Nadu fishermen at a very low=20=20<br />
&gt; price so that the Kerala manufacturer and Tamil Nadu fishermen are=20=20<br />
&gt; equally benefited. But the danger is always that very old boats are=20=20<br />
&gt; not strong enough to face the wrath of sea waves in times of=20=20<br />
&gt; inclement weather in turbulent seas. Therefore, most of these boats=20=20<br />
&gt; meet with tragedies.<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; The report says there is no demarca tion point in seas to show=20=20<br />
&gt; Indian and Lankan maritime areas in seawaters. While big ships can=20=20<br />
&gt; identify it through sophisticated machines, poor, ill-equipped=20=20<br />
&gt; fishing boats can't do it. So the Lankan Navy attacks Rameswaram=20=20<br />
&gt; fishermen in mid seas in Sri Lankan waters.<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; The report adds that the Tamil Nadu Fisheries Department has=20=20<br />
&gt; officially permitted fishing only in some areas of Indian Ocean that=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; are certified good and safe for fishing. Fishermen are not permitted=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; to go into deep seas that are dangerous in terms of human safety.=20=20<br />
&gt; But fishermen do not obey these safety instructions! High-power=20=20<br />
&gt; motor fishing boats from Kerala make these fish-greedy fishermen=20=20<br />
&gt; have false courage and lead them to watery graves in deep seas where=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; fishermen get much less fish amidst all hazards, which take toll of=20=20<br />

&gt; with a constitutional amendment that removes the two-term=20=20<br />
&gt; restrictions on the Presidency. This means that pr esident Mahinda=20=20<br />
&gt; Rajapaksa, the first beneficiary of the 18th amendment, can be=20=20<br />
&gt; president for life, subject to re-election.The amendment also gives=20=20<br />
&gt; the president the authority to appoint top judges and other public=20=20<br />
&gt; officials, including heads of independent bodies such as the human=20=20<br />
&gt; rights commission, the election commission and the public service=20=20<br />
&gt; commission, unrestricted by a legal veto. Even before this=20=20<br />
&gt; amendment, the powers of the Sri Lankan president were immense as=20=20<br />
&gt; they could dissolve parliament, hold as many portfolios as they=20=20<br />
&gt; wished and claimed complete immunity from the rule of law.The 18th=20=20<br />
&gt; amendment gives a substantial boost to these powers. As worrying as=20=20<br />
&gt; the implications of the amendment for Sri Lanka's democracy is the=20=20<br />
&gt; manner in which it was passed by parliament. Listed as an 'urgent=20=20<br />
&gt; bill', the amendment was tabled and passed in 10 days only. Clearly=20=20<br />
&gt; the government, which has a clear majority in parliament anyway,=20=20<br />
&gt; wanted no legal challenges to stop or slow its attem pt to push Sri=20=20<br />
&gt; Lanka down the road to authoritarian rule.That Rajapaksa is popular=20=20<br />
&gt; among the Sinhalese majority, especially since the defeat of the=20=20<br />
&gt; Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in May 2009, is undoubted.=20=20<br />
&gt; However, the manner in which he has been systematically building a=20=20<br />
&gt; cult around himself, one that gives him god-like status, is=20=20<br />
&gt; distasteful. He and his family control the levers of power in Sri=20=20<br />
&gt; Lanka today, holding powerful positions as ministers and as heads of=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; corporations.Any threat to Rajapaksa's rule has been snuffed out;=20=20<br />
&gt; the fate of former army chief, Lt Gen Sarat Fonseka is a telling=20=20<br />
&gt; example of what happens to those who challenge the president.=20=20<br />
&gt; Critics in the media have been severely dealt with. It is in the=20=20<br />
&gt; context of this dramatic expansion of Rajapaksa's grip over power=20=20<br />
&gt; that the 18th amendment must be seen. It paves the way for=20=20<br />
&gt; perpetuation of the rule of an all-powerful president.The=20=20<br />
&gt; possibility of Rajapaksa doing away with the fig leaf of periodic=20=20<br />
&gt; elect ions now looms over Sri Lanka which is on its way to becoming=20=20<br />
&gt; a full-fledged authoritarian dictatorship. The developments in the=20=20<br />
&gt; island are of concern not only to the people of Sri Lanka but for=20=20<br />
&gt; India and for democrats across the world.<br />

&gt; Secession Speech<br />
&gt; Article by Inayat Jehangir: &quot;New Slogans&quot; -- text in boldface as=20=20<br />
&gt; formatted by source - Force Online<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; Monday September 13, 2010 07:19:26 GMT<br />
&gt; National Conference president and Union minister Farooq Abdullah may=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; have earned a few brownie points with the rest of the country by=20=20<br />
&gt; claiming that no Kashmiri wants to secede from India but he has=20=20<br />
&gt; drawn ire of Kashmiris -- from Separatists to mainstream opposition=20=20<br />
&gt; parties to the common masses.<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; Hard line Hurriyat Conference led by Syed Ali Shah Geelani, while=20=20<br />
&gt; expressing views on Abdullah's statement in the Lok Sabha, dared the=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; former chief minister to take a walk around Lal Chowk for just five=20=20<br />
&gt; minutes. &quot;Abdullah's statement is an extreme case of buffoonery and=20=20<br />
&gt; a bundle of lies. He should think more of his family's safety than=20=20<br />
&gt; talking of Kashmir as he has lost his ground in Kashmir,&quot; Geelani=20=20<br />
&gt; said.<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; The octogenarian separatist leader said if the claims made by=20=20<br />
&gt; Abdullah were true, India should have no objection in holding=20=20<br />
&gt; referendum in Kashmir. &quot;Our fundamental demand is that plebiscite=20=20<br />
&gt; should be held to ascertain view of Kashmiris so that it becomes=20=20<br />
&gt; clear whether or not they want to live with India,&quot; he said.<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; He referred to the visit of Abdullah's son and chief minister Omar=20=20<br />
&gt; Abdullah to SKIMS hospital to meet the persons injured in security=20=20<br />
&gt; forces firing. &quot;Omar Abdullah had to fly in a helicopter to cover a=20=20<br />
&gt; distance of eight kilometers as the roads were not safe for him and=20=20<br />
&gt; even when he reached the hospital he was booed away.&quot;<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; The Chairman of the moderate faction of Hurriyat Conference Mirwaiz=20=20<br />
&gt; Umar Farooq said the National Conference president was trying to be=20=20<br />
&gt; 'more loyal than the king' in his efforts to appease New Delhi.<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; &quot;It is ironical that the party which has been in power for over six=20=20<br />
&gt; decades has deliberately failed to acknowledge the aspirations of=20=20<br />
&gt; Kashmiris mainly to show loyalty to India and satiate its vested=20=20<br />
&gt; interests,&quot; Mirwaiz said.<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; The Hurriyat dove said it was 'shame' on part of leaders like=20=20<br />
&gt; Abdullah, who claim to represent Kashmiris and yet ignore the=20=20<br />
&gt; genuine aspirations for self determination among the people of the=20=20<br />
&gt; state. &quot;On the contrary, an MP from Hyderabad vociferously and from=20=20<br />
&gt; the core of his heart acknowledged that innocents are being killed=20=20<br />
&gt; in Kashmir and expressed serious concern over it. We want to tell=20=20<br />
&gt; leaders like Farooq that for God's sake stop exploiting Kashmir=20=20<br />
&gt; issue for their personal interests,&quot; he said.<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; The Chairperson of Dukhtaran-e-Millat Aasiya Andrabi castigated=20=20<br />
&gt; National Conference president for claiming that autonomy was the=20=20<br />
&gt; solution to the Kashmir dispute. &quot;At a time when the Kashmiris=20=20<br />
&gt; including children have only one objective and slogan of 'Quit Jammu=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; Kashmir', Abdullah's claim tha t they want autonomy is nothing more=20=20<br />
&gt; than a bundle of lies. This has exposed the evil designs of National=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; Conference,&quot; Andrabi said.<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; The radical woman leader said Abdullah's statement was a blessing in=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; disguise as more and more people have started pledging support to=20=20<br />
&gt; the ongoing 'Quit Jammu and Kashmir Movement'. &quot;We have received=20=20<br />
&gt; numerous phone calls from all sections of the society since Abdullah=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; made the speech in Indian Parliament, pledging support for 'Quit=20=20<br />
&gt; Jammu Kashmir Movement'. The overwhelming support to ongoing=20=20<br />
&gt; movement from over past three months has made it clear that this=20=20<br />
&gt; movement does not belong to any individual but whole Kashmir. People=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; have taken vow that unless India accept the disputed nature of=20=20<br />
&gt; Kashmir, the agitation will continue,&quot; she added.<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; Although opposition People's Democratic Party (PDP) chose not to=20=20<br />
&gt; react initially to the statement made by the president of arch rival=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; National Conference, a party spokesman told FORCE t hat the=20=20<br />
&gt; statement of the union minister was, at the least, provocative and=20=20<br />
&gt; would not help in improving the situation. &quot;After having brought the=20=<br />
=20<br />
&gt; state on the brink of one of the worst crisis, the National=20=20<br />
&gt; Conference leadership has now resorted to provocation, which is not=20=20<br />
&gt; going to help in improving the situation in the state,&quot; Nayeem=20=20<br />
&gt; Akhtar, PDP C hief spokesman, said.<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; The man on the street, however, is neither amused nor surprised at=20=20<br />
&gt; the 'theatrics' of the former chief minister in the Lok Sabha.=20=20<br />
&gt; &quot;There is nothing new in what he has said.... He does it all the=20=20<br />
&gt; time when he is Delhi and sings altogether a different tune when=20=20<br />
&gt; back in Srinagar,&quot; Muzaffar Ahmad Bhat, a businessman, said.<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; While Abdullah was more brazen at misrepresenting the ground=20=20<br />
&gt; situation of Kashmir in New Delhi, Bhat said every mainstream=20=20<br />
&gt; politician from the state was doing the same. &quot;Otherwise, how is it=20=20<br />
&gt; possible that the decision makers in New Delhi do not know that peo=20=20<br />
&gt; ple of Kashmir want azadi -- independence -- to decide their=20=20<br />
