		<h3>Tor</h3>
		<p><a href="https://www.torproject.org">Tor</a> is an encrypted anonymising network that makes it harder to intercept internet communications, or see where communications are coming from or going to.</p>
		<p>In order to use the WikiLeaks public submission system as detailed above you can download the Tor Browser Bundle, which is a Firefox-like browser available for Windows, Mac OS X and GNU/Linux and pre-configured to connect using the anonymising system Tor.</p>
		<h4>Tails</h4>
		<p>If you are at high risk and you have the capacity to do so, you can also access the submission system through a secure operating system called <a href="https://tails.boum.org">Tails</a>. Tails is an operating system launched from a USB stick or a DVD that aim to leaves no traces when the computer is shut down after use and automatically routes your internet traffic through Tor. Tails will require you to have either a USB stick or a DVD at least 4GB big and a laptop or desktop computer.</p>

		<h3>Tips</h3>
		<p>Our submission system works hard to preserve your anonymity, but we recommend you also take some of your own precautions. Please review these basic guidelines. </p>
		<div>
			<h4>1. Contact us if you have specific problems</h4>
			<p>If you have a very large submission, or a submission with a complex format, or are a high-risk source, please <a href="#submit_help_contact">contact us</a>. In our experience it is always possible to find a custom solution for even the most seemingly difficult situations.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h4>2. What computer to use</h4>
			<p>If the computer you are uploading from could subsequently be audited in an investigation, consider using a computer that is not easily tied to you. Technical users can also use <a href="https://tails.boum.org">Tails</a> to help ensure you do not leave any records of your submission on the computer.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h4>3. Do not talk about your submission to others</h4>
			<p>If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in source protection – it is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This includes other media organisations.</p>
		</div>

	</div>

		<h3>After</h3>

		<div>
			<h4>1. Do not talk about your submission to others</h4>
			<p>If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in source protection – it is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This includes other media organisations.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h4>2. Act normal</h4>
			<p>If you are a high-risk source, avoid saying anything or doing anything after submitting which might promote suspicion. In particular, you should try to stick to your normal routine and behaviour.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h4>3. Remove traces of your submission</h4>
			<p>If you are a high-risk source and the computer you prepared your submission on, or uploaded it from, could subsequently be audited in an investigation, we recommend that you format and dispose of the computer hard drive and any other storage media you used.</p>
			<p>In particular, hard drives retain data after formatting which may be visible to a digital forensics team and flash media (USB sticks, memory cards and SSD drives) retain data even after a secure erasure. If you used flash media to store sensitive data, it is important to destroy the media.</p>
			<p>If you do this and are a high-risk source you should make sure there are no traces of the clean-up, since such traces themselves may draw suspicion.</p>
			<div>
				<h4>4. If you face legal action</h4>
				<p>If a legal action is brought against you as a result of your submission, there are organisations that may help you. The Courage Foundation is an international organisation dedicated to the protection of journalistic sources. You can find more details at <a href="https://www.couragefound.org">https://www.couragefound.org</a>.</p>

		<p>WikiLeaks publishes documents of political or historical importance that are censored or otherwise suppressed. We specialise in strategic global publishing and large archives.</p>
		<p>The following is the address of our secure site where you can anonymously upload your documents to WikiLeaks editors. You can only access this submissions system through Tor. (See our <a href="#submit_help_tor">Tor tab</a> for more information.) We also advise you to read our <a href="#submit_help_tips">tips for sources</a> before submitting.</p>

			<!--<div>
				Copy this address into your Tor browser. Advanced users, if they wish, can also add a further layer of encryption to their submission using <a href="#submit_wlkey">our public PGP key</a>.
			</div>-->
		</div>

		<p>If you cannot use Tor, or your submission is very large, or you have specific requirements, WikiLeaks provides several alternative methods. <a href="#submit_help_contact">Contact us</a> to discuss how to proceed.</p>

IDEOLOGICAL ISSUES INVLOVING FOREIGNERS AND FOREIGN CONTACTS.
HOWEVER THE BASIC RATIONALE AND OVERALL DIRECTION OF THE U.S.-PRC
RELATIONSHIP CONTINUES TO BE ACCEPTED BY PRC LEADERS OF ALL
PERSUASIONS AND THIS WAS UNDERSCORED BY THE RECENT EXTRAORDINARY
RECEPTION ACCORDED SEVERAL IMPORTANT U.S. VISITORS TO CHINA. NEW
THEMES WHICH HAVE APPEARED DURING THE PERIOD HAVE DOWNGRADED THE
DIRECT AND NEAR-TERM SOVIET THREAT TO THE PRC WHILE STRESSING
THE INEVITABILITY OF WAR BETWEEN THE U.S. AND USSR SUPERPOWERS
AND THE PRIORITY OF THE WEST OVER THE EAST AS THE MAIN TARGET
OF SOVIET AGGRESSION. THESE NEW THEMES, WHICH WERE LIKELY
ORIGINATED BY MAO AND PROBABLY FAVORED BY PRC LEFTISTS, FITS
MORE COMFORTABLY WITH THE OVERALL CONTEXT OF THE DOMESTIC IDEO-
OGICAL CAMPAIGN. CHIEF SOVIET BORDER TALK NEGOTIATOR ILICHEV
HAS RETURNED TO PEKING BUT THUS FAR IT IS UNCLEAR WHETHER NEW
PROPOSALS ARE FORTHCOMING FROM EITHER SIDE. PEKING CONTINUES
TO GIVE SPECIAL ATTENTION IN VARIOUS INTERNATIONAL FORUMS TO
BURNISHING ITS CLAIM TO THIRD WORLD MEMBERSHIP AND TO A STANDARD
BEARER ROLE AGAINST SUPERPOWER HEGEMONIC EFFORTS TO SEIZE WORLD
RESOURCES. END SUMMARY.

1. AT MID-YEAR, INDICATIONS WERE MIXED ABOUT HOW THE INTERNAL
POLITICAL MOVEMENT WAS AFFECTING PRC FOREIGN RELATIONS. ON THE
ONE HAND, THE LEFTISTS APPEARED TO HAVE WON THEIR POINT AT LEAST
ON CULTURAL AND IDEOLOGICAL ISSUES. THE RESULT ESSENTIALLY HAS
BEEN TO HIGHLIGHT FOR THE CHINESE PEOPLE THE AMBIVALENCE IN
CHINA'S NEW RELATIONS WITH THE BOURGEOISIE WORLD. THE MESSAGE
CONFIDENTIAL

CONFIDENTIAL

PAGE 03  HONG K 08111  01 OF 04  181801Z

IS THAT WHILE CHINA'S ESTABLISHMENT OF DIPLOMATIC AND TRADE
RELATIONS WITH THE CAPITALISTS IS A CRAFTY AND USEFUL MOVE,
IT BY NO MEANS OBVIATES THE IDEOLOGICAL SCHISM BETWEEN THESE
SOCIETIES ON THE ONE HAND AND SOCIALIST CHINA ON THE OTHER.
WHILE THERE MAY BE EXPEDIENT UNITY AND COOPERATION IN SOME
FIELDS, IDEOLOGICAL STRUGGLE MUST NOT BE FORGOTTEN.

2. DECISIONS TO TIGHTEN UP IDEOLOGICALLY WERE APPARENTLY MADE
DURING LEADERSHIP DISCUSSIONS EARLIER IN THE YEAR. AT THAT TIME
THOSE RESPONSIBLE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS, INCLUDING WE IMAGINE
CHOU EN-LAI OR THOSE CLOSE TO HIM, PROBABLY HAD TO ADMIT THAT
SOME MISTAKES HAD BEEN MADE--NOT IN LINE BUT IN THE IMPLEMEN-
TATION OF THE AGREED POLICY OF DETENTE. THE RECENT CANCELLATION
OF THE VANCOUVER SYMPHONY AND THE OUSTER OF THE U.S. MARINE
GUARDS AT USLO, FOR EXAMPLE, REPRESENTED REVERSALS OF DECISIONS
MADE A LITTLE MORE THAN A YEAR AGO. THE EARLIER ATTACK ON
ANTONIONI, WHICH DIED DOWN DURING THE SECOND QUARTER, ALSO IMPLIED
SOME CRITICISM OF STATE COUNCIL AND PARTICULARLY FOREIGN
AFFAIRS PERSONNEL.

3. THE REGIME HAS NOW INSTITUTED TIGHTER CONTROLS OVER FOREIGN
MEDIA REPRESENTATIVES, INCLUDING APPARENTLY A &quot;LACK LIST&quot; OF
SORTS, AND IT HAS ADOPTED A MORE NARROW VIEW OF &quot;FRIENDLY&quot;
CRITICISM. IN OTHER REVERSLAS, PEKING EXCLUDED U.S. CONGEN
OFFICIALS AS WELL AS MOST FOREIGN NEWSMEN FROM THE CANTON FAIR,
POSTPONED THE VISIT OF AN OFFICIAL CHINESE TRADE DELEGATION TO
THE U.S., AND CANCELLED PRC STUDENT EXCHANGE ARRANGEMENTS WITH
THE UK FOLLOWING THE DEFECTION OF ONE PRC STUDENT IN LONDON.
IN CONTRAST TO TREATMENT OF THE U.S. ONE YEAR AGO, CHINESE MEDIA
ALSO KEPT UP A STEADY ONE-SIDED DEROGATORY PICTURE OF U.S.
(AND EUROPEAN) SOCIETY INCLUDING REFERENCES TO THE &quot;U.S. RULING
CLIQUE.&quot; THE CAMPAIGN PUBLICIZING CONTRIVED HORROR STORIES
OF ALLEGED AMERICAN AND FOREIGN ATROCITIES IN CHINA DURING THE
PRE-COMMUNIST PERIOD ALSO CONTINUED AND WAS IN FACT VISIBLE IN THE
CAPTAL CITY. THIS PROPAGANDA WAS CONCURRENT WITH A RENEWAL
OF PRAISE FOR THE SPIRIT OF THE BOXERS AND AN ARTICLE IN
THE SHANGHAI JOURNAL STUDY AND CRITICISM TYING LIN PIAO FOR THE
FIRST TIME TO &quot;U.S. IMPERIALISM.&quot; TOWARD THE END OF THE QUARTER,

HOWEVER, THERE WAS SOME ENCOURAGING PICKUP ON CULTURAL SIDE AS
VARIOUS U.S. ACADEMIC SPECIALIST AND FRIENDSHIP GROUPS VISITED CHINA

CINCPAC FOR POLAD

4. AMID THESE ADJUSTMENTS AND THE VARIATIONS IN ATMOSPHERE,
THERE WERE CLEARLY ETCHED SIGNS THAT THE OVERALL DIRECTION OF
U.S.-SINO RELATIONS AS BASED ON THE SHANGHAI COMMUNIQUE CONTINUES
TO BE ACCEPTED BY PRC LEADERS OF ALL PERSUASIONS. THIS WAS
UNDERSCORED PARTICULARLY STRONGLY BY SEVERAL LATE-JUNE EARLY-JULY
EVENTS. THE LAVISH COURT PAID BY A HOST OF TOP LEVEL PRC LEADERS,
INCLUDING WANG HUNG-WEN AND CHIANG CHING, TO THE REVISIT OF FAMED
AMERICAN PHYSICIST YANG CHEN-NING, WAS STRIKING. THIS WAS
FOLLOWED BY THE JULY 1-6 VISIT OF SENATOR JACKSON THAT ENCOMPASSED
LONG DISCUSSIONS WITH TENG HSIAO-PING AND CHIAO KUAN-HUA AND AN
EXTRAORDINARY MEETING IN A HOSPITAL WITH AILING PREMIER CHOU
EN-LAI. IT WAS HARDLY ACCIDENTAL THAT THESE VISITS AND THE
ATTENDANT PUBLICITY COINCIDED WITH PRESIDENT NIXON'S SUMMIT TALKS
IN MOSCOW, ALTHOUGH NO REFERENCE TO SENATOR JACKSON'S VIEWS ABOUT
U.S.-SOVIET NOR U.S.-SINO RELATIONS HAS APPEARED YET IN THE
PEKING MEDIA. ALSO ON THE UPBEAT SIDE WAS THE ATICLE OF FOREIGN
TRADE MINISTER LI CHIANG IN CHINA'S FOREIGN TRADE QUARTERLY IN
WHICH WHILE DECLARING THAT CHINA WOULD NEVER &quot;GROVEL&quot; FOR FROEIGN
LOANS NOR SEEK JOINT VENTURES, ASSERTED THAT &quot;CHINA BY NO MEANS
WOULD CLOSE THE DOOR ON TRADE.&quot;

5. NEW THEMES SIGNIFICANTLY EMERGED IN CHINESE STATEMENTS IN
THE SPRING PREDICTING AN INEVITABLE WAR BETWEEN THE U.S. AND THE
USSR AND DISMISSING THE DIRECT AND NEAR-TERM SOVIET THREAT TO
CHINA. THIS HAD THE EFFECT OF DEEMPHASIZING THE URGENCY OF THE
SECURITY IMPERATIVE BEHIND CHINA'S IMPROVED RELATIONS WITH THE
U.S., A CHANGE IN POSTURE WHICH WAS PROBABLY SEEN AS HAVING A
DESIRABLE IMPACT ON INTERNAL AS WELL AS EXTERNAL AUDIENCES. WE
IMAGINE THE NEW THEMES WERE PARTICULARLY WELCOMED BY THE LEFTIST
ELEMENTS, BUT WE GUESS THAT THEY WERE ORIGINATED BY MAO, WHO WAS
ATTEMPTING THEREBY TO SET THE LINE, STRENGTHEN THE CONSENSUS ON
GLOBAL STRATEGY AND TAKE ACCOUNT OF NEW REALITIES.

6. AMIDST THE BULLISHNESS AND THE PROPHECY OF SUPERPOWER
DOOM, HOWEVER, IT WAS MADE DISTINCLY CLEAR THAT THE STRATEGIC,
CONFIDENTIAL

CONFIDENTIAL

PAGE 03  HONG K 08111  02 OF 04  190040Z

POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC JUSTIFICATIONS OF THE OPENING TO THE
WEST, IN PARTICULAR TO THE U.S., REMAINED UNAFFECTED. THUS PRC
MEDIA HAVE ONLY CARRIED BRIEF FACTUAL REPORTS ABOUT PRESIDENT
NIXON'S SUMMIT TALKS. HOWEVER, PRC-OWND HONG KONG PRESS
EXCERPTED FOEIGN COMMENTARIES TO CONVEY INDIRECTLY PEKING'S
VIEW THAT THE SUMMIT ACHIEVED LITTLE, THAT U.S.-USSR DETENTE
REMAINS A SHAM AND THAT U.S.-SINO RELATIONS ARE IMPROVING.
CHINESE CONTINUED TO URGE VISITING EUROPEANS TO MAINTAIN UNITY
WITH THE U.S. AND ADVISED JAPANESE TO BE SURE TO INCLUDE
AMERICANS IN ANY ECONOMIC VENTURE THEY SHOULD ENTER INTO IN THE
SOVIET UNION. IN ITS PICTURE OF SUPERPOWER CONTENTION PEKING
CONTINUED TO PAINT THE U.S. AS ON THE DEFENSIVE AND RESPONDING
TO SOVIET BUILD-UPS FROM THE INDIAN OCEAN TO THE NUCLEAR ARMS
RACE. ALSO ON THE TOUCHY ISSUES OF KOREA AND INDICHINA THE PRC
STUCK TO ITS RESTRAINED AND CAUTIOUS TREATMENT OF THE U.S. THIS
WAS TRUE EVEN AS PEKING TRIED TO PICK UP POINTS WITH PYONGYANG
AT MOSCOW'S EXPENSE BY REPEATING DPRK DEMANDS FOR IMMEDIATE
U.S. MILITARY WITHDRAWAL FROM SOUTH KOREA. PEKING HAS, HOWEVER,
CAREFULLY AVOIDED REPEATING BELLICOSE AND HARSH PRC CHARGES ABOUT
ALLEGED U.S. INSTIGATION OF THE PAK GOVERNMENT TO &quot;WAGE A NEW
WAR&quot; AND HAS KEPT ITS SUPPORT VERY MUCH IN THE CONTEXT OF KIM
IL SUNG'S PEACEFUL REUNIFICATION PROPOSAL.

7. IN REGARD TO TAIW,, TENG HSIAO-PING IN A CONVERSATION WITH
AN AUSTRIAN DELEGATION AT THE END OF MARCH STRESSED THE POSSIBILITY
OF &quot;PEACEFUL LIBERATION,&quot; A LINE WHICH HAD SEEMED TO BE UNDER A
CLOUD AT THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR. IN SUSEQUENT TALKS WITH
VISITING U.S. GOVERNORS, CHINESE LEADERS EMPHASIZED THE STANDARD
LIEN THAT TAIWAN WAS THE OBSTACLE TO NORMALIZATION OF U.S.-PCR
RELATIONS, BUT THEY DID NOT COMPLAIN THAT THE U.S. HAD DEPARTED
FROM THE SHANGHAI COMMUNIQUE. LOWER RANKING OFFICIALS, HOWEVER,
WERE OCCASIONALLY REPORTED AS PROTESTING U.S. ACTIONS IN REGARD
TO TAIWAN, SUCH AS THE POSITNG OF A NEW AMBASSADOR TO TAIPEI.
VIEWED FROM HERE, THE CHINESE APPEAR TO WANT TAIWAN IN CENTER
FOCUS FOR ANY FURTHER, MAJOR DEVELOPMENT IN THE NORMALIZATION
OF SINO-U.S. RELATIONS. SHORT OF THAT, THE CHINESE WOULD
WELCOME SIGNS FROM US THAT WE WANT TO MOVE AHEAD. THEY WOULD
PROBALBY BE NEGATIVE TOWARD ANY SUGGESTION THAT WE ARE CONTENT
WITH THE RELATIONSHIP AS IT STANDS.

8. WHILE THE NEAR TERM AND DIRECT SOIVET THREAT TO CHINA
CONFIDENTIAL

CONFIDENTIAL

PAGE 04  HONG K 08111  02 OF 04  190040Z

WAS PLAYED DOWN, AND EVEN REFUTED, PEKING CONTUNED TO EMPHASIZE
THE SOVIET UNION'S LONG-TERM AMBITIONS, THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF
DEALING WITH MOSCOW, AND THE USSR'S AGGRESSIVE INTENTIONS
TOWARD EUROPE AND ITS NAVAL BUILD-UP AROUND THE WORLD. THIS
LINE WAS RELENTLESSLY PURSUED IN PRIVATE TALKS WITH VISITING
FOREIGN LEADERS, IN THE CONTINUING STREAM OF ANTI-SOVIET POLEMICS
IN CHINESE MEDIA, AND IN MAJOR PRC PRONOUNCEMENTS AT THE UN AND
OTHER INTERNATIONAL FORUMS. DOUBTLESS THE CHINESE REMAIN
CONCERNED OVER THE SOVIET THREAT TO THEM,BUT THEY ARE ALSO
CONCERNED THAT THIRD PARTIES ASSESS THE SOVIET THREAT MORE
BROADLY, AND NOT POINT IT NARROWLY AT CHINA'S NECK.

9. THE HELICOPTER INCIDENT WAS THE MAJOR EVENT DURING THE
PERIOD IN SINO-SOVIET RELATIONS, BUT CHINESE CENTRAL MEDIA
REMAINED STRANGELY SILENT AFTER PEKING'S INITIAL ANNOUNCEMENT.
PRESUMABLY THE CHINESE ARE SAVING UP FOR A PROPAGANDA BARRAGE
WHICH WILL RECORD THE TRIAL OF THE CAPTURED CREWMEN AND POSSIBLY
THEIR EXPULSION. IN ANY EVENT, THE EPISODE IS BOUND TO BE MADE
USE OF BY PEKING. THE CHINESE ARE AWARE THAT THEIR DOMESTIC
POLITICS HAVE AGAIN AROUSED CUROSITY AND HOPES IN MOSCOW AND
PART OF PEKING'S CONFIDENCE IN FACING DOWN THE SOVIETS MAY LIE
IN ITS CALCULATION THAT THE USSR IS UNLIKELY TO COMPROMISE THE
POSSIBILITY OF SOME FAVORABLE TURN OF EVENTS INSIDE CHINA--HOWEVER
REMOTE--BY ADOPTING A MORE THREATENING POSTURE. INDEED, THE
CURRENT LEADERS IN PEKING MIGHT WELCOME SOME SOVIET ATTEMPT AT
RETALIATION IN ORDER TO FURTHER EXPUNGE PRO-SOVIET FEELING IN
CHINA.

10. IN LATE JUNE CHIEF SOVIET BORDER TALKS NEGOTIATOR ILICHEV
RETURNED TO PEKING AFTER ABOUT A YEAR'S ABSENCE. ACCORDING TO
A USLO REPORT THE CHINESE VIEWED THE RETURN AS A TRANSPARENT
SOVIET EFFORT TO INDICATE TO THE U.S. DURING THE MOSCOW SUMMIT
TALKS THAT THE SOVIETS HAD AN OPEN LINE TO PEKING. WHILE MOSCOW
REPORTEDLY HAS RAISED NO NEW PROPOSALS WITH THE CHINESE, ILICHEV'S
RETURN REPRESENTS A REVERSAL OF THE PREVIOUS SOVIET POSITION
THAT THEY WOULD NOT RETURN TO THE NEGOTIATING TABLE UNTIL PEKING
REPLIED TO EARLIER RUSSIAN PROPOSALS. THIS LATEST MOVE FOLLOWS
A SERIES OF APPARENT SOVIET CONCESSIONS MADE DURING THE PAST
YEAR TO WHICH THE CHINESE APPARENTLY HAVE NOT RESPONDED.

11. ON SEVERAL RECENT OCCASIONS CHINESE LEADERS DESCRIBED PRC
RELATIONS WITH JAPAN AS &quot;PU TSOU&quot; (NOT BAD). ACTUALLY THEY
WERE BETTER THAN &quot;PU TSOU.&quot; THE CHINESE INDICATED THAT THE
SIGNING OF THE CIVIL AIR AGREEMENT HAD OPENED THE DOOR TO A
SERIES OF OTHER SINO-JAPANESE ACCORDS, INCLUDING A PEACE TREATY.
ALTHOUGH GOVERNMENT-TO-GOVERNMENT FISHING AND TRADE NEGOTIATIONS
HAVE RUN INTO FISHING LIMITATIONS AND PRICING OBSTACLES AND THE
CONFIDENTIAL

CONFIDENTIAL

PAGE 03  HONG K 08111  03 OF 04  190007Z

JAPANESE NEGOTIATORS ON FISHING ISSUE HAVE RETURNED HOME, OVERALL
ECONOMIC RELATIONS ARE FLOURISHING. TRADE WITH JAPAN CONTINUED
TO BOOM AND JAPANESE DELEGATIONS OF ALL DESCRIPTIONS FLOWED  INTO
PEKING IN AN EVER-WIDENING STREAM. DESPITE CONTINUED MEDIA
RECALL OF OLD JAPANESE CRIMES AGAINST CHINA AND OCCASIONAL
WARNINGS ABOUT THE ACTIVITIES OF A HANDFUL OF JAPANESE &quot;RIGHTISTS,&quot;
PEKING STILL CARRIED RELATIVELY FEW NEGATIVE ARTICLES ON INTERNAL
JAPANESE AFFAIRS. INSTEAD, SINO-JAPANESE FRIENDHSIP WAS HIGH-
LIGHTED BY SHIP TOURS AND SISTER CITY BONDS. PERHAPS MOST
SIGNIFICANT WAS THE ABSENCE OF CHINESE CRITICISM AT THE UN
SPECIAL SESSION OF JAPAN'S ECONOMIC ROLE IN ASIA.

12. PEKING DESCRIBED THE UN SPECIAL SESSION AS A &quot;MILESTONE
OF FAR-REACHING SIGNIFICANCE.&quot; THE CHINESE SAW THE DRIVE FOR
REFORM OF INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC RELATIONS AS PROVIDING CHINA
STRATEGIC BENEFIT AS WELL AS SOME ECONOMIC ONES OVER THE LONG
RUN ANETHEY MOVED TO ACCENTUATE THEIR ROLE AS A MEMBER OF THE
THIRD WORLD. CHINESE BEHAVIOR AT THE CARACAS LOS CONFERENCE
DEMONSTRATED THE PRIORITY PEKING HAS ASSIGNED TO THE ENHANCEMENT
OF ITS CLAIMS AS A THIRD WORLD STANDARD BEARER. IN FURTHERANCE
OF THIS GOAL, PEKING ROLLED OUT THE RED CARPET SEVERAL TIMES
EACH MONTH TO WELCOME THIRD WORLD LEADERS. IN THEIR COMMENT ON
THIRD WORLD ISSUES HOWEVER, THE PRC DID NOT PLAY UP THE RICH-
POOR SPLIT BUT AS EXPECTED HEAPED RESPONSIBILITY FOR ALL THE
TROUBLES OF THE DEVELOPING COUNTRIES ON THE SUPERPOWERS,
PARTICULARLY THE SOVIT UNION. CHINA'S INSISTENCE ON THIS LINE
TOGETHER WITH A NUMBER OF OTHER CONSIDERATIONS UNDERSCORED THE
GULF THAT STILL SEPARATES THE PRC FROM THE NON-COMMUNIST NATIONS
OF AFRICA, ASIA AND LATIN AMERICA.

13. THE PRC'S IMPLIED PREFERENCE FOR A CONTINUATION OF THE
FIGHTING IN MOZAMBIQUE AND ANGOLA RATHER THAN A NEGOTIATED
SETTLEMENT, REFLECTED ITS POWER POLITICS APPROACH TO PROBLEMS OF
THE THIRD WORLD. IN THE MID-EAST, HOWEVER, THE CHINESE CONTINUED
TO MANEUVER INTO A MORE FLEXIBLE POSITION IN REGARD TO THE ARAB-
ISRAELI CONFLICT, WHICH THEY ALSO PROBABLY WOULD PREFER TO REMAIN
UNSETTLED. THE PRC PUT THE BEST FACE POSSIBLE ON THE
DISENGAGEMENT AGREEMENTS AND ON THE SUCCESSFUL U.S. DIPLOMACY,
PORTRAYING THESE AS FURTHER SIGNS THAT SOVIET INFLUENCE WAS
SERIOUSLY SLIPPING IN THE MID-EAST. IT WAS AGAINST THIS BACK-
GROUND THAT PEKING GAVE STRAIGHT NEWS ACCOUNT TYPE COVERAGE

DID NOT DISPUTE ISRAEL'S RIGHT TO EXISTENCE. NEVERTHELESS, PEKING
CONTINUED TO SKIRT THE ISSUE OF A PERMANENT PEACE IN THE AREA
AND TO WARN OF GREATER TURMOIL.

14. MEANWHILE WITH THE LONG VISIT TO THE PRC OF KHIEU SAMPHAN,
PEKING STRENGTHENED ITS HAND WITH THE KHMER INSURGENT
ORGANIZATON AND HAS BEEN GIVING MUCH LESS ATTENTION TO SIHANOUK
AS ITS MAIN CARD IN CAMBODIA. A MILITARY AID AGREEMENT WITH THE
RGNUK WAS OPENLY ANNOUNCED, SUGGESTING THAT CHINA DOES NOT FEEL
THIS VIOLATES THE PARIS AGREEMENT OR ELSE THAT CONTINUED U.S.
AID FOR PHNOM PENH HAS REMOVED RESTRICTIONS ON PUBLIC ACKNOWLEDGE-
MENT OF PRC AID. IN ANY EVENT, THE CHINESE APPEAR REASONABLY
CONFIDENT THAT THE EFFECTS OF THE CONFLICT IN CAMBODIA CAN BE
CONTAINED.

14. ELSEWHERE IN ITS OWN ASIAN BACKYARD, CHINA CONTINUED TO
PUSH FOR RELAXATION OF TENSION. AFTER SEVERAL YEARS OF
PREPARATION, THE BREAKTHROUGH IN PEKING'S DRIVE FOR ACCOMMODATION
WITH NON-COMMUNIST SOUTHEAST ASIA WAS MARKED BY THE ESTABLISHMENT
OF DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS WITH MALAYSIA. PEKING'S HOPE OF SHAKING
OFF THE OVERSEAS CHINESE ALBATROSS WAS REFLECTED IN ITS FOR-
BEARANCE OF DUAL NATIONALITY AND ITS DECISION TO DENY OVERSEAS
CHINESE STATUS TO THOSE TRAVELING ON PASSPORTS OF OTHER COUNTRIES.
THE CHINESE SEEMED OPTIMISTIC THAT THE OTHER SEAN STATES WOULD
FOLLOW MALAYSIA SOONER OR LATER. LIKEWISE, IN SOUTH ASIA THE
PRC WELCOMED THE INDO-PAK BANGLADESH AGREEMENT AND INDICATED
ITS OWN DESIRE TO ESTABLISH RELATIONS WITH DACCA AND IMPROVE
THIES WITH NEW DELHI. PEKING REACTED CALMLY TO THE INDIAN NUCLEAR
TEST, INDICATING PRVATELY THAT IT DID NOT HAVE ANY STRATEGIC
SIGNIFICANCE NOR WOULD IT EFFECT THE BALANCE OF POWER IN SOUTH
ASIA.

15. FINALLY ON FOREIGN TRADE, DOMESTIC CRITICISM OF TOO MUCH
RELIANCE ON FOREIGN TECHNOLOGY AND WARNINGS AGAINST ACCEPTING
SHODDY GOODS FROM ABROAD CONTRIBUTED TO TOUGHER ATTITUDES BY
CHINESE NEGOTIATORS. BY THE END OF THE QUARTER, HOWEVER A
LULL IN MAJOR PALNT IMPORT NEGOTIATIONS HAD BECOME OBVIOUS, AND
IT WAS PROBABLY ATTRIBUTABLE PARTLY TO THE CURRENT CRITICISM
MOVEMENT AS WELL AS PARTLY TO ECONOMIC FACTORS SUCH AS, FOR
CONFIDENTIAL

CONFIDENTIAL

PAGE 03  HONG K 08111  04 OF 04  190036Z

EXAMPLE, PRICE RISES AND UNCERTAINTIES ABOUT FUTURE PRICES OF
FOREIGN PLANT AND EQUIPMENT. IN THIS CONTEXT THERE APPEARED THE
FIRST ISSUE OF CHINA'S FOREIGN TRADE, THE RESURRECTION OF A
PRE-CULTURAL REVOLUTION MAGAZINE POSSIBLY DESIGNED TO REASSURE
THE FOREIGNER. FOREIGN MINISTER LI CHIANG'S ARTICLE (HONG KONG
7807; PEKING 1177) PROBABLY REPRESENTS WORDING THAT ALL FACTIONS
CAN NOW AGREE UPON. LEAVING LARGE MARGINS FOR ACTUAL LEVELS AND
FOR MODES OF IMPLEMENTATION IT ALLOWS FOR INCREASING EXPORTS AND
INCREASING IMPORTS ACCORDINGLY. IT DRAWS LIMITS, HOWEVER, IN
SAYING THE PRC WILL NOT &quot;GROVEL&quot; FORE FOREIGN LOANS, ALLOW FOREIGN
INVESTMENT, NOR ENGAGE IN JOINT VENTURES. NEVERTHELESS, OTHER
PHRASES SUCH AS PAYING FOR IMPORTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH &quot;COMMON
INTERNATIONAL PRACTICE&quot;--WOULD SEEM TO PERMIT INCREASED USE OF
FOREIGN CREDITS AND THUS A HIGHER LEVEL OF IMPORTS.

HOWEVER THE BASIC RATIONALE AND OVERALL DIRECTION OF THE U.S.-PRC
RELATIONSHIP CONTINUES TO BE ACCEPTED BY PRC LEADERS OF ALL
PERSUASIONS AND THIS WAS UNDERSCORED BY THE RECENT EXTRAORDINARY

IS THAT WHILE CHINA'S ESTABLISHMENT OF DIPLOMATIC AND TRADE
RELATIONS WITH THE CAPITALISTS IS A CRAFTY AND USEFUL MOVE,
IT BY NO MEANS OBVIATES THE IDEOLOGICAL SCHISM BETWEEN THESE
SOCIETIES ON THE ONE HAND AND SOCIALIST CHINA ON THE OTHER.
WHILE THERE MAY BE EXPEDIENT UNITY AND COOPERATION IN SOME

2. DECISIONS TO TIGHTEN UP IDEOLOGICALLY WERE APPARENTLY MADE
DURING LEADERSHIP DISCUSSIONS EARLIER IN THE YEAR. AT THAT TIME
THOSE RESPONSIBLE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS, INCLUDING WE IMAGINE
CHOU EN-LAI OR THOSE CLOSE TO HIM, PROBABLY HAD TO ADMIT THAT
SOME MISTAKES HAD BEEN MADE--NOT IN LINE BUT IN THE IMPLEMEN-
TATION OF THE AGREED POLICY OF DETENTE. THE RECENT CANCELLATION
OF THE VANCOUVER SYMPHONY AND THE OUSTER OF THE U.S. MARINE
GUARDS AT USLO, FOR EXAMPLE, REPRESENTED REVERSALS OF DECISIONS
MADE A LITTLE MORE THAN A YEAR AGO. THE EARLIER ATTACK ON
ANTONIONI, WHICH DIED DOWN DURING THE SECOND QUARTER, ALSO IMPLIED
SOME CRITICISM OF STATE COUNCIL AND PARTICULARLY FOREIGN
AFFAIRS PERSONNEL.

3. THE REGIME HAS NOW INSTITUTED TIGHTER CONTROLS OVER FOREIGN
MEDIA REPRESENTATIVES, INCLUDING APPARENTLY A &quot;LACK LIST&quot; OF
SORTS, AND IT HAS ADOPTED A MORE NARROW VIEW OF &quot;FRIENDLY&quot;
CRITICISM. IN OTHER REVERSLAS, PEKING EXCLUDED U.S. CONGEN
OFFICIALS AS WELL AS MOST FOREIGN NEWSMEN FROM THE CANTON FAIR,
POSTPONED THE VISIT OF AN OFFICIAL CHINESE TRADE DELEGATION TO
THE U.S., AND CANCELLED PRC STUDENT EXCHANGE ARRANGEMENTS WITH
THE UK FOLLOWING THE DEFECTION OF ONE PRC STUDENT IN LONDON.
IN CONTRAST TO TREATMENT OF THE U.S. ONE YEAR AGO, CHINESE MEDIA
ALSO KEPT UP A STEADY ONE-SIDED DEROGATORY PICTURE OF U.S.
(AND EUROPEAN) SOCIETY INCLUDING REFERENCES TO THE &quot;U.S. RULING
CLIQUE.&quot; THE CAMPAIGN PUBLICIZING CONTRIVED HORROR STORIES
OF ALLEGED AMERICAN AND FOREIGN ATROCITIES IN CHINA DURING THE
PRE-COMMUNIST PERIOD ALSO CONTINUED AND WAS IN FACT VISIBLE IN THE
CAPTAL CITY. THIS PROPAGANDA WAS CONCURRENT WITH A RENEWAL
OF PRAISE FOR THE SPIRIT OF THE BOXERS AND AN ARTICLE IN
THE SHANGHAI JOURNAL STUDY AND CRITICISM TYING LIN PIAO FOR THE
FIRST TIME TO &quot;U.S. IMPERIALISM.&quot; TOWARD THE END OF THE QUARTER,

HOWEVER, THERE WAS SOME ENCOURAGING PICKUP ON CULTURAL SIDE AS
VARIOUS U.S. ACADEMIC SPECIALIST AND FRIENDSHIP GROUPS VISITED CHINA

CINCPAC FOR POLAD

4. AMID THESE ADJUSTMENTS AND THE VARIATIONS IN ATMOSPHERE,
THERE WERE CLEARLY ETCHED SIGNS THAT THE OVERALL DIRECTION OF
U.S.-SINO RELATIONS AS BASED ON THE SHANGHAI COMMUNIQUE CONTINUES
TO BE ACCEPTED BY PRC LEADERS OF ALL PERSUASIONS. THIS WAS
UNDERSCORED PARTICULARLY STRONGLY BY SEVERAL LATE-JUNE EARLY-JULY
EVENTS. THE LAVISH COURT PAID BY A HOST OF TOP LEVEL PRC LEADERS,
INCLUDING WANG HUNG-WEN AND CHIANG CHING, TO THE REVISIT OF FAMED
AMERICAN PHYSICIST YANG CHEN-NING, WAS STRIKING. THIS WAS
FOLLOWED BY THE JULY 1-6 VISIT OF SENATOR JACKSON THAT ENCOMPASSED
LONG DISCUSSIONS WITH TENG HSIAO-PING AND CHIAO KUAN-HUA AND AN
EXTRAORDINARY MEETING IN A HOSPITAL WITH AILING PREMIER CHOU
EN-LAI. IT WAS HARDLY ACCIDENTAL THAT THESE VISITS AND THE
ATTENDANT PUBLICITY COINCIDED WITH PRESIDENT NIXON'S SUMMIT TALKS
IN MOSCOW, ALTHOUGH NO REFERENCE TO SENATOR JACKSON'S VIEWS ABOUT
U.S.-SOVIET NOR U.S.-SINO RELATIONS HAS APPEARED YET IN THE
PEKING MEDIA. ALSO ON THE UPBEAT SIDE WAS THE ATICLE OF FOREIGN
TRADE MINISTER LI CHIANG IN CHINA'S FOREIGN TRADE QUARTERLY IN
WHICH WHILE DECLARING THAT CHINA WOULD NEVER &quot;GROVEL&quot; FOR FROEIGN
LOANS NOR SEEK JOINT VENTURES, ASSERTED THAT &quot;CHINA BY NO MEANS
WOULD CLOSE THE DOOR ON TRADE.&quot;

5. NEW THEMES SIGNIFICANTLY EMERGED IN CHINESE STATEMENTS IN
THE SPRING PREDICTING AN INEVITABLE WAR BETWEEN THE U.S. AND THE
USSR AND DISMISSING THE DIRECT AND NEAR-TERM SOVIET THREAT TO
CHINA. THIS HAD THE EFFECT OF DEEMPHASIZING THE URGENCY OF THE
SECURITY IMPERATIVE BEHIND CHINA'S IMPROVED RELATIONS WITH THE
U.S., A CHANGE IN POSTURE WHICH WAS PROBABLY SEEN AS HAVING A
DESIRABLE IMPACT ON INTERNAL AS WELL AS EXTERNAL AUDIENCES. WE
IMAGINE THE NEW THEMES WERE PARTICULARLY WELCOMED BY THE LEFTIST
ELEMENTS, BUT WE GUESS THAT THEY WERE ORIGINATED BY MAO, WHO WAS
ATTEMPTING THEREBY TO SET THE LINE, STRENGTHEN THE CONSENSUS ON
GLOBAL STRATEGY AND TAKE ACCOUNT OF NEW REALITIES.

6. AMIDST THE BULLISHNESS AND THE PROPHECY OF SUPERPOWER
DOOM, HOWEVER, IT WAS MADE DISTINCLY CLEAR THAT THE STRATEGIC,
CONFIDENTIAL

CONFIDENTIAL

PAGE 03  HONG K 08111  02 OF 04  190040Z

POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC JUSTIFICATIONS OF THE OPENING TO THE
WEST, IN PARTICULAR TO THE U.S., REMAINED UNAFFECTED. THUS PRC
MEDIA HAVE ONLY CARRIED BRIEF FACTUAL REPORTS ABOUT PRESIDENT
NIXON'S SUMMIT TALKS. HOWEVER, PRC-OWND HONG KONG PRESS
EXCERPTED FOEIGN COMMENTARIES TO CONVEY INDIRECTLY PEKING'S
VIEW THAT THE SUMMIT ACHIEVED LITTLE, THAT U.S.-USSR DETENTE
REMAINS A SHAM AND THAT U.S.-SINO RELATIONS ARE IMPROVING.
CHINESE CONTINUED TO URGE VISITING EUROPEANS TO MAINTAIN UNITY
WITH THE U.S. AND ADVISED JAPANESE TO BE SURE TO INCLUDE
AMERICANS IN ANY ECONOMIC VENTURE THEY SHOULD ENTER INTO IN THE
SOVIET UNION. IN ITS PICTURE OF SUPERPOWER CONTENTION PEKING
CONTINUED TO PAINT THE U.S. AS ON THE DEFENSIVE AND RESPONDING
TO SOVIET BUILD-UPS FROM THE INDIAN OCEAN TO THE NUCLEAR ARMS
RACE. ALSO ON THE TOUCHY ISSUES OF KOREA AND INDICHINA THE PRC
STUCK TO ITS RESTRAINED AND CAUTIOUS TREATMENT OF THE U.S. THIS
WAS TRUE EVEN AS PEKING TRIED TO PICK UP POINTS WITH PYONGYANG
AT MOSCOW'S EXPENSE BY REPEATING DPRK DEMANDS FOR IMMEDIATE
U.S. MILITARY WITHDRAWAL FROM SOUTH KOREA. PEKING HAS, HOWEVER,
CAREFULLY AVOIDED REPEATING BELLICOSE AND HARSH PRC CHARGES ABOUT
ALLEGED U.S. INSTIGATION OF THE PAK GOVERNMENT TO &quot;WAGE A NEW
WAR&quot; AND HAS KEPT ITS SUPPORT VERY MUCH IN THE CONTEXT OF KIM
IL SUNG'S PEACEFUL REUNIFICATION PROPOSAL.

7. IN REGARD TO TAIW,, TENG HSIAO-PING IN A CONVERSATION WITH
AN AUSTRIAN DELEGATION AT THE END OF MARCH STRESSED THE POSSIBILITY
OF &quot;PEACEFUL LIBERATION,&quot; A LINE WHICH HAD SEEMED TO BE UNDER A
CLOUD AT THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR. IN SUSEQUENT TALKS WITH
VISITING U.S. GOVERNORS, CHINESE LEADERS EMPHASIZED THE STANDARD
LIEN THAT TAIWAN WAS THE OBSTACLE TO NORMALIZATION OF U.S.-PCR
RELATIONS, BUT THEY DID NOT COMPLAIN THAT THE U.S. HAD DEPARTED
FROM THE SHANGHAI COMMUNIQUE. LOWER RANKING OFFICIALS, HOWEVER,
WERE OCCASIONALLY REPORTED AS PROTESTING U.S. ACTIONS IN REGARD
TO TAIWAN, SUCH AS THE POSITNG OF A NEW AMBASSADOR TO TAIPEI.
VIEWED FROM HERE, THE CHINESE APPEAR TO WANT TAIWAN IN CENTER
FOCUS FOR ANY FURTHER, MAJOR DEVELOPMENT IN THE NORMALIZATION
OF SINO-U.S. RELATIONS. SHORT OF THAT, THE CHINESE WOULD
WELCOME SIGNS FROM US THAT WE WANT TO MOVE AHEAD. THEY WOULD
PROBALBY BE NEGATIVE TOWARD ANY SUGGESTION THAT WE ARE CONTENT
WITH THE RELATIONSHIP AS IT STANDS.

8. WHILE THE NEAR TERM AND DIRECT SOIVET THREAT TO CHINA
CONFIDENTIAL

CONFIDENTIAL

PAGE 04  HONG K 08111  02 OF 04  190040Z

WAS PLAYED DOWN, AND EVEN REFUTED, PEKING CONTUNED TO EMPHASIZE
THE SOVIET UNION'S LONG-TERM AMBITIONS, THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF
DEALING WITH MOSCOW, AND THE USSR'S AGGRESSIVE INTENTIONS
TOWARD EUROPE AND ITS NAVAL BUILD-UP AROUND THE WORLD. THIS
LINE WAS RELENTLESSLY PURSUED IN PRIVATE TALKS WITH VISITING
FOREIGN LEADERS, IN THE CONTINUING STREAM OF ANTI-SOVIET POLEMICS
IN CHINESE MEDIA, AND IN MAJOR PRC PRONOUNCEMENTS AT THE UN AND
OTHER INTERNATIONAL FORUMS. DOUBTLESS THE CHINESE REMAIN
CONCERNED OVER THE SOVIET THREAT TO THEM,BUT THEY ARE ALSO
CONCERNED THAT THIRD PARTIES ASSESS THE SOVIET THREAT MORE
BROADLY, AND NOT POINT IT NARROWLY AT CHINA'S NECK.

CINCPAC FOR POLAD

9. THE HELICOPTER INCIDENT WAS THE MAJOR EVENT DURING THE
PERIOD IN SINO-SOVIET RELATIONS, BUT CHINESE CENTRAL MEDIA
REMAINED STRANGELY SILENT AFTER PEKING'S INITIAL ANNOUNCEMENT.
PRESUMABLY THE CHINESE ARE SAVING UP FOR A PROPAGANDA BARRAGE
WHICH WILL RECORD THE TRIAL OF THE CAPTURED CREWMEN AND POSSIBLY
THEIR EXPULSION. IN ANY EVENT, THE EPISODE IS BOUND TO BE MADE
USE OF BY PEKING. THE CHINESE ARE AWARE THAT THEIR DOMESTIC
POLITICS HAVE AGAIN AROUSED CUROSITY AND HOPES IN MOSCOW AND
PART OF PEKING'S CONFIDENCE IN FACING DOWN THE SOVIETS MAY LIE
IN ITS CALCULATION THAT THE USSR IS UNLIKELY TO COMPROMISE THE
POSSIBILITY OF SOME FAVORABLE TURN OF EVENTS INSIDE CHINA--HOWEVER
REMOTE--BY ADOPTING A MORE THREATENING POSTURE. INDEED, THE
CURRENT LEADERS IN PEKING MIGHT WELCOME SOME SOVIET ATTEMPT AT
RETALIATION IN ORDER TO FURTHER EXPUNGE PRO-SOVIET FEELING IN
CHINA.

10. IN LATE JUNE CHIEF SOVIET BORDER TALKS NEGOTIATOR ILICHEV
RETURNED TO PEKING AFTER ABOUT A YEAR'S ABSENCE. ACCORDING TO
A USLO REPORT THE CHINESE VIEWED THE RETURN AS A TRANSPARENT
SOVIET EFFORT TO INDICATE TO THE U.S. DURING THE MOSCOW SUMMIT
TALKS THAT THE SOVIETS HAD AN OPEN LINE TO PEKING. WHILE MOSCOW
REPORTEDLY HAS RAISED NO NEW PROPOSALS WITH THE CHINESE, ILICHEV'S
RETURN REPRESENTS A REVERSAL OF THE PREVIOUS SOVIET POSITION
THAT THEY WOULD NOT RETURN TO THE NEGOTIATING TABLE UNTIL PEKING
REPLIED TO EARLIER RUSSIAN PROPOSALS. THIS LATEST MOVE FOLLOWS
A SERIES OF APPARENT SOVIET CONCESSIONS MADE DURING THE PAST
YEAR TO WHICH THE CHINESE APPARENTLY HAVE NOT RESPONDED.

11. ON SEVERAL RECENT OCCASIONS CHINESE LEADERS DESCRIBED PRC
RELATIONS WITH JAPAN AS &quot;PU TSOU&quot; (NOT BAD). ACTUALLY THEY
WERE BETTER THAN &quot;PU TSOU.&quot; THE CHINESE INDICATED THAT THE
SIGNING OF THE CIVIL AIR AGREEMENT HAD OPENED THE DOOR TO A
SERIES OF OTHER SINO-JAPANESE ACCORDS, INCLUDING A PEACE TREATY.
ALTHOUGH GOVERNMENT-TO-GOVERNMENT FISHING AND TRADE NEGOTIATIONS
HAVE RUN INTO FISHING LIMITATIONS AND PRICING OBSTACLES AND THE
CONFIDENTIAL

CONFIDENTIAL

PAGE 03  HONG K 08111  03 OF 04  190007Z

JAPANESE NEGOTIATORS ON FISHING ISSUE HAVE RETURNED HOME, OVERALL
ECONOMIC RELATIONS ARE FLOURISHING. TRADE WITH JAPAN CONTINUED
TO BOOM AND JAPANESE DELEGATIONS OF ALL DESCRIPTIONS FLOWED  INTO
PEKING IN AN EVER-WIDENING STREAM. DESPITE CONTINUED MEDIA
RECALL OF OLD JAPANESE CRIMES AGAINST CHINA AND OCCASIONAL
WARNINGS ABOUT THE ACTIVITIES OF A HANDFUL OF JAPANESE &quot;RIGHTISTS,&quot;
PEKING STILL CARRIED RELATIVELY FEW NEGATIVE ARTICLES ON INTERNAL
JAPANESE AFFAIRS. INSTEAD, SINO-JAPANESE FRIENDHSIP WAS HIGH-
LIGHTED BY SHIP TOURS AND SISTER CITY BONDS. PERHAPS MOST
SIGNIFICANT WAS THE ABSENCE OF CHINESE CRITICISM AT THE UN
SPECIAL SESSION OF JAPAN'S ECONOMIC ROLE IN ASIA.

12. PEKING DESCRIBED THE UN SPECIAL SESSION AS A &quot;MILESTONE
OF FAR-REACHING SIGNIFICANCE.&quot; THE CHINESE SAW THE DRIVE FOR
REFORM OF INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC RELATIONS AS PROVIDING CHINA
STRATEGIC BENEFIT AS WELL AS SOME ECONOMIC ONES OVER THE LONG
RUN ANETHEY MOVED TO ACCENTUATE THEIR ROLE AS A MEMBER OF THE
THIRD WORLD. CHINESE BEHAVIOR AT THE CARACAS LOS CONFERENCE
DEMONSTRATED THE PRIORITY PEKING HAS ASSIGNED TO THE ENHANCEMENT
OF ITS CLAIMS AS A THIRD WORLD STANDARD BEARER. IN FURTHERANCE
OF THIS GOAL, PEKING ROLLED OUT THE RED CARPET SEVERAL TIMES
EACH MONTH TO WELCOME THIRD WORLD LEADERS. IN THEIR COMMENT ON
THIRD WORLD ISSUES HOWEVER, THE PRC DID NOT PLAY UP THE RICH-
POOR SPLIT BUT AS EXPECTED HEAPED RESPONSIBILITY FOR ALL THE
TROUBLES OF THE DEVELOPING COUNTRIES ON THE SUPERPOWERS,
PARTICULARLY THE SOVIT UNION. CHINA'S INSISTENCE ON THIS LINE
TOGETHER WITH A NUMBER OF OTHER CONSIDERATIONS UNDERSCORED THE
GULF THAT STILL SEPARATES THE PRC FROM THE NON-COMMUNIST NATIONS
OF AFRICA, ASIA AND LATIN AMERICA.

13. THE PRC'S IMPLIED PREFERENCE FOR A CONTINUATION OF THE
FIGHTING IN MOZAMBIQUE AND ANGOLA RATHER THAN A NEGOTIATED
SETTLEMENT, REFLECTED ITS POWER POLITICS APPROACH TO PROBLEMS OF
THE THIRD WORLD. IN THE MID-EAST, HOWEVER, THE CHINESE CONTINUED
TO MANEUVER INTO A MORE FLEXIBLE POSITION IN REGARD TO THE ARAB-
ISRAELI CONFLICT, WHICH THEY ALSO PROBABLY WOULD PREFER TO REMAIN
UNSETTLED. THE PRC PUT THE BEST FACE POSSIBLE ON THE
DISENGAGEMENT AGREEMENTS AND ON THE SUCCESSFUL U.S. DIPLOMACY,
PORTRAYING THESE AS FURTHER SIGNS THAT SOVIET INFLUENCE WAS
SERIOUSLY SLIPPING IN THE MID-EAST. IT WAS AGAINST THIS BACK-
GROUND THAT PEKING GAVE STRAIGHT NEWS ACCOUNT TYPE COVERAGE
CONFIDENTIAL

CONFIDENTIAL

PAGE 04  HONG K 08111  03 OF 04  190007Z

TO PRESIDENT NIXON'S VISIT TO THE MIDDLE EAST. AS HAPPENED A
YEAR AGO A HIGH-RANKING CHINESE OFFICIAL INDICATED THAT CHINA
DID NOT DISPUTE ISRAEL'S RIGHT TO EXISTENCE. NEVERTHELESS, PEKING
CONTINUED TO SKIRT THE ISSUE OF A PERMANENT PEACE IN THE AREA
AND TO WARN OF GREATER TURMOIL.

14. MEANWHILE WITH THE LONG VISIT TO THE PRC OF KHIEU SAMPHAN,
PEKING STRENGTHENED ITS HAND WITH THE KHMER INSURGENT
ORGANIZATON AND HAS BEEN GIVING MUCH LESS ATTENTION TO SIHANOUK
AS ITS MAIN CARD IN CAMBODIA. A MILITARY AID AGREEMENT WITH THE
RGNUK WAS OPENLY ANNOUNCED, SUGGESTING THAT CHINA DOES NOT FEEL
THIS VIOLATES THE PARIS AGREEMENT OR ELSE THAT CONTINUED U.S.
AID FOR PHNOM PENH HAS REMOVED RESTRICTIONS ON PUBLIC ACKNOWLEDGE-
MENT OF PRC AID. IN ANY EVENT, THE CHINESE APPEAR REASONABLY
CONFIDENT THAT THE EFFECTS OF THE CONFLICT IN CAMBODIA CAN BE
CONTAINED.

14. ELSEWHERE IN ITS OWN ASIAN BACKYARD, CHINA CONTINUED TO
PUSH FOR RELAXATION OF TENSION. AFTER SEVERAL YEARS OF
PREPARATION, THE BREAKTHROUGH IN PEKING'S DRIVE FOR ACCOMMODATION
WITH NON-COMMUNIST SOUTHEAST ASIA WAS MARKED BY THE ESTABLISHMENT
OF DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS WITH MALAYSIA. PEKING'S HOPE OF SHAKING
OFF THE OVERSEAS CHINESE ALBATROSS WAS REFLECTED IN ITS FOR-
BEARANCE OF DUAL NATIONALITY AND ITS DECISION TO DENY OVERSEAS
CHINESE STATUS TO THOSE TRAVELING ON PASSPORTS OF OTHER COUNTRIES.
THE CHINESE SEEMED OPTIMISTIC THAT THE OTHER SEAN STATES WOULD
FOLLOW MALAYSIA SOONER OR LATER. LIKEWISE, IN SOUTH ASIA THE
PRC WELCOMED THE INDO-PAK BANGLADESH AGREEMENT AND INDICATED
ITS OWN DESIRE TO ESTABLISH RELATIONS WITH DACCA AND IMPROVE
THIES WITH NEW DELHI. PEKING REACTED CALMLY TO THE INDIAN NUCLEAR
TEST, INDICATING PRVATELY THAT IT DID NOT HAVE ANY STRATEGIC
SIGNIFICANCE NOR WOULD IT EFFECT THE BALANCE OF POWER IN SOUTH
ASIA.

15. FINALLY ON FOREIGN TRADE, DOMESTIC CRITICISM OF TOO MUCH
RELIANCE ON FOREIGN TECHNOLOGY AND WARNINGS AGAINST ACCEPTING
SHODDY GOODS FROM ABROAD CONTRIBUTED TO TOUGHER ATTITUDES BY
CHINESE NEGOTIATORS. BY THE END OF THE QUARTER, HOWEVER A
LULL IN MAJOR PALNT IMPORT NEGOTIATIONS HAD BECOME OBVIOUS, AND
IT WAS PROBABLY ATTRIBUTABLE PARTLY TO THE CURRENT CRITICISM
MOVEMENT AS WELL AS PARTLY TO ECONOMIC FACTORS SUCH AS, FOR
CONFIDENTIAL

CONFIDENTIAL

PAGE 03  HONG K 08111  04 OF 04  190036Z

EXAMPLE, PRICE RISES AND UNCERTAINTIES ABOUT FUTURE PRICES OF
FOREIGN PLANT AND EQUIPMENT. IN THIS CONTEXT THERE APPEARED THE
FIRST ISSUE OF CHINA'S FOREIGN TRADE, THE RESURRECTION OF A
PRE-CULTURAL REVOLUTION MAGAZINE POSSIBLY DESIGNED TO REASSURE
THE FOREIGNER. FOREIGN MINISTER LI CHIANG'S ARTICLE (HONG KONG
7807; PEKING 1177) PROBABLY REPRESENTS WORDING THAT ALL FACTIONS
CAN NOW AGREE UPON. LEAVING LARGE MARGINS FOR ACTUAL LEVELS AND
FOR MODES OF IMPLEMENTATION IT ALLOWS FOR INCREASING EXPORTS AND
INCREASING IMPORTS ACCORDINGLY. IT DRAWS LIMITS, HOWEVER, IN
SAYING THE PRC WILL NOT &quot;GROVEL&quot; FORE FOREIGN LOANS, ALLOW FOREIGN
INVESTMENT, NOR ENGAGE IN JOINT VENTURES. NEVERTHELESS, OTHER
PHRASES SUCH AS PAYING FOR IMPORTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH &quot;COMMON
INTERNATIONAL PRACTICE&quot;--WOULD SEEM TO PERMIT INCREASED USE OF
FOREIGN CREDITS AND THUS A HIGHER LEVEL OF IMPORTS.
