		<h3>Tor</h3>
		<p><a href="https://www.torproject.org">Tor</a> is an encrypted anonymising network that makes it harder to intercept internet communications, or see where communications are coming from or going to.</p>
		<p>In order to use the WikiLeaks public submission system as detailed above you can download the Tor Browser Bundle, which is a Firefox-like browser available for Windows, Mac OS X and GNU/Linux and pre-configured to connect using the anonymising system Tor.</p>
		<h4>Tails</h4>
		<p>If you are at high risk and you have the capacity to do so, you can also access the submission system through a secure operating system called <a href="https://tails.boum.org">Tails</a>. Tails is an operating system launched from a USB stick or a DVD that aim to leaves no traces when the computer is shut down after use and automatically routes your internet traffic through Tor. Tails will require you to have either a USB stick or a DVD at least 4GB big and a laptop or desktop computer.</p>

		<h3>Tips</h3>
		<p>Our submission system works hard to preserve your anonymity, but we recommend you also take some of your own precautions. Please review these basic guidelines. </p>
		<div>
			<h4>1. Contact us if you have specific problems</h4>
			<p>If you have a very large submission, or a submission with a complex format, or are a high-risk source, please <a href="#submit_help_contact">contact us</a>. In our experience it is always possible to find a custom solution for even the most seemingly difficult situations.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h4>2. What computer to use</h4>
			<p>If the computer you are uploading from could subsequently be audited in an investigation, consider using a computer that is not easily tied to you. Technical users can also use <a href="https://tails.boum.org">Tails</a> to help ensure you do not leave any records of your submission on the computer.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h4>3. Do not talk about your submission to others</h4>
			<p>If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in source protection – it is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This includes other media organisations.</p>
		</div>

	</div>

		<h3>After</h3>

		<div>
			<h4>1. Do not talk about your submission to others</h4>
			<p>If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in source protection – it is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This includes other media organisations.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h4>2. Act normal</h4>
			<p>If you are a high-risk source, avoid saying anything or doing anything after submitting which might promote suspicion. In particular, you should try to stick to your normal routine and behaviour.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h4>3. Remove traces of your submission</h4>
			<p>If you are a high-risk source and the computer you prepared your submission on, or uploaded it from, could subsequently be audited in an investigation, we recommend that you format and dispose of the computer hard drive and any other storage media you used.</p>
			<p>In particular, hard drives retain data after formatting which may be visible to a digital forensics team and flash media (USB sticks, memory cards and SSD drives) retain data even after a secure erasure. If you used flash media to store sensitive data, it is important to destroy the media.</p>
			<p>If you do this and are a high-risk source you should make sure there are no traces of the clean-up, since such traces themselves may draw suspicion.</p>
			<div>
				<h4>4. If you face legal action</h4>
				<p>If a legal action is brought against you as a result of your submission, there are organisations that may help you. The Courage Foundation is an international organisation dedicated to the protection of journalistic sources. You can find more details at <a href="https://www.couragefound.org">https://www.couragefound.org</a>.</p>

		<p>WikiLeaks publishes documents of political or historical importance that are censored or otherwise suppressed. We specialise in strategic global publishing and large archives.</p>
		<p>The following is the address of our secure site where you can anonymously upload your documents to WikiLeaks editors. You can only access this submissions system through Tor. (See our <a href="#submit_help_tor">Tor tab</a> for more information.) We also advise you to read our <a href="#submit_help_tips">tips for sources</a> before submitting.</p>

			<!--<div>
				Copy this address into your Tor browser. Advanced users, if they wish, can also add a further layer of encryption to their submission using <a href="#submit_wlkey">our public PGP key</a>.
			</div>-->
		</div>

		<p>If you cannot use Tor, or your submission is very large, or you have specific requirements, WikiLeaks provides several alternative methods. <a href="#submit_help_contact">Contact us</a> to discuss how to proceed.</p>

OF POWER IN PRC, WERE PRELUDE FOR TIME WHEN MAO HIMSELF

15.  CHINA

SUN'S ISAACS, IN HK, INSISTS MAO'S ABSENCE FROM THURSDAY
CEREMONY HONORING CHOU IS &quot;FURTHER SIGN OF HIS FAILING

HEALTH,&quot; SINCE ASSUMED, IF PHYSICALLY ABLE, CHAIRMAN
WOULD HAVE APPEARED TO JOIN MEMORIAL FOR OLDEST, CLOSEST,
MOST TALENTED OF ASSOCIATES.  INEVITABLY, MAO'S ABSENCE
ALSO HEIGHTENED SENSE THAT EXTRAORDINARY CEREMONIES FOR
CHOU AND SHARPENED FOCUS HIS DEATH BROUGHT TO TRANSITION
OF POWER IN PRC, WERE PRELUDE FOR TIME WHEN MAO HIMSELF
PASSES FROM SCENE.  SHOW OF GRIEF FOR CHOU AMONG MOURNING
CHINESE MASSES WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN EVOKED BY ANY OTHER
CHINESE LEADER EXCEPT MAO.

REPORTING HK ANALYSTS BELIEVE CHOICE OF TENG HSIAO-PING TO
DELIVER MEMORIAL SPEECH CLEARLY MARKS HIM AS MAN MOST
LIKELY SUCCEED CHOU AND PROBABLY MOVE UP CCP HIERACHY,
BUTTERFIELD (NYT) VIEWS TENG'S EULOGY FOR CHOU AS
IMPRESSIVE DEMONSTRATION HE IS NOW IN CHARGE.

CDN'S BEECH, IN HK, LAUDS CHOU AS PRC'S &quot;INDISPENSABLE

ISOLATE YOUR ENEMY.&quot;  BEECH MAINTAINS &quot;THERE HAS BEEN NO
BETTER DEFINITION&quot; PAKING DIPLOMACY (JAN 10-11).

SUN'S WU, IN HK, SAYS MUCH HAS BEEN SAID ABOUT CHOU'S
TACT, TALENTS AS NEGOTIATOR AMONG EQUALS AT INTER-
NATIONAL SESSIONS; &quot;BUT RELATIVELY LITTLE HAS BEEN RE-
CORDED ABOUT HIS QUIET WAY OF LEAVING A WARM IMPACT
ON THE SIMPLE AND ORDINARY PEOPLE EACH TIME HE ARRIVED
FOR A MEETING AND AGAIN WHEN HE LEFT.&quot;

SHIRLEY MACLAINE, IN INTERVIEW WITH CSM'S UNGER, RECALLS
HER PRC VISIT.  SAYS CHINESE ATTEMPTING KIND OF &quot;MASS
HUMAN HONESTY,&quot; WAS FASCINATED BY PEKING'S APPARENT
SUCCESS IN RAISING MASSES' LIVING STANDARD, GIVING PEOPLE
STRONG COMMON GOAL.  BUT EXPRESSES CRITICISM OF CHINESE
&quot;OVER-DEMOCRATIZATION&quot; OF ARTS. WOULDN'T WANT CHINESE
SYSTEM HERE, ANY MORE THAN WOULD WISH IMPOSE OUR SYSTEM
ON THEM.

BOSTON HERALD AMERICAN (1-9) EDITORIALLY TAKES NOTE OF
CHOU'S DEATH AND STATES THAT HE WILL BE REMEMBERED &quot;AS
THE ONE WHO BROKE THE ICE AND SET THE STAGE&quot; FOR MORE
NORMAL RELATIONS BETWEEN US, PRC.

PHILADELPHIA SUNDAY BULLETIN (1-11) SAYS CHOU, IN DEATH,
&quot;WALKED OUT IN FRONT OF MAO&quot;.  RECOUNTS DISTINGUISHED
AND VARIED CHOU BIO.  CHINA NOW FACED WITH
THE PASSING OF ITS AGED LEADERSHIP, BUT &quot;SOLIDLY BASED
NATIONAL INTERESTS OUTLIVE INDIVIDUALS&quot;.  CAUTIONS

HOWEVER, THAT WITH NEW GENERATION IN THE OFFING,
INTERESTS CAN CHANGE AND NOTHING SHOULD BE TAKEN FOR
GRANTED.
