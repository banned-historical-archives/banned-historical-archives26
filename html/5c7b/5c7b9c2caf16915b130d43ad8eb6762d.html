		<h3>Tor</h3>
		<p><a href="https://www.torproject.org">Tor</a> is an encrypted anonymising network that makes it harder to intercept internet communications, or see where communications are coming from or going to.</p>
		<p>In order to use the WikiLeaks public submission system as detailed above you can download the Tor Browser Bundle, which is a Firefox-like browser available for Windows, Mac OS X and GNU/Linux and pre-configured to connect using the anonymising system Tor.</p>
		<h4>Tails</h4>
		<p>If you are at high risk and you have the capacity to do so, you can also access the submission system through a secure operating system called <a href="https://tails.boum.org">Tails</a>. Tails is an operating system launched from a USB stick or a DVD that aim to leaves no traces when the computer is shut down after use and automatically routes your internet traffic through Tor. Tails will require you to have either a USB stick or a DVD at least 4GB big and a laptop or desktop computer.</p>

		<h3>Tips</h3>
		<p>Our submission system works hard to preserve your anonymity, but we recommend you also take some of your own precautions. Please review these basic guidelines. </p>
		<div>
			<h4>1. Contact us if you have specific problems</h4>
			<p>If you have a very large submission, or a submission with a complex format, or are a high-risk source, please <a href="#submit_help_contact">contact us</a>. In our experience it is always possible to find a custom solution for even the most seemingly difficult situations.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h4>2. What computer to use</h4>
			<p>If the computer you are uploading from could subsequently be audited in an investigation, consider using a computer that is not easily tied to you. Technical users can also use <a href="https://tails.boum.org">Tails</a> to help ensure you do not leave any records of your submission on the computer.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h4>3. Do not talk about your submission to others</h4>
			<p>If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in source protection – it is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This includes other media organisations.</p>
		</div>

	</div>

		<h3>After</h3>

		<div>
			<h4>1. Do not talk about your submission to others</h4>
			<p>If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in source protection – it is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This includes other media organisations.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h4>2. Act normal</h4>
			<p>If you are a high-risk source, avoid saying anything or doing anything after submitting which might promote suspicion. In particular, you should try to stick to your normal routine and behaviour.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h4>3. Remove traces of your submission</h4>
			<p>If you are a high-risk source and the computer you prepared your submission on, or uploaded it from, could subsequently be audited in an investigation, we recommend that you format and dispose of the computer hard drive and any other storage media you used.</p>
			<p>In particular, hard drives retain data after formatting which may be visible to a digital forensics team and flash media (USB sticks, memory cards and SSD drives) retain data even after a secure erasure. If you used flash media to store sensitive data, it is important to destroy the media.</p>
			<p>If you do this and are a high-risk source you should make sure there are no traces of the clean-up, since such traces themselves may draw suspicion.</p>
			<div>
				<h4>4. If you face legal action</h4>
				<p>If a legal action is brought against you as a result of your submission, there are organisations that may help you. The Courage Foundation is an international organisation dedicated to the protection of journalistic sources. You can find more details at <a href="https://www.couragefound.org">https://www.couragefound.org</a>.</p>

		<p>WikiLeaks publishes documents of political or historical importance that are censored or otherwise suppressed. We specialise in strategic global publishing and large archives.</p>
		<p>The following is the address of our secure site where you can anonymously upload your documents to WikiLeaks editors. You can only access this submissions system through Tor. (See our <a href="#submit_help_tor">Tor tab</a> for more information.) We also advise you to read our <a href="#submit_help_tips">tips for sources</a> before submitting.</p>

			<!--<div>
				Copy this address into your Tor browser. Advanced users, if they wish, can also add a further layer of encryption to their submission using <a href="#submit_wlkey">our public PGP key</a>.
			</div>-->
		</div>

		<p>If you cannot use Tor, or your submission is very large, or you have specific requirements, WikiLeaks provides several alternative methods. <a href="#submit_help_contact">Contact us</a> to discuss how to proceed.</p>

2. LI: I UNDERSTAND YOU HAVE BEEN HERE FOR SOME DAYS.
IS THIS THE FIRST TRIP FOR THE DELEGATION MEMBERS TO
CHINA (SENATOR CRANSTON RESPONDED AFFIRMATIVELY). I
WOULD LIKE TO WELCOME YOU.
3.CRANSTON: WE ARE EAGER TO MEET WITH YOU AS WITH

ECONOMY AND HOPE TO ACHIEVE THE FOUR MODERNIZATIONS
BY THE END OF THIS CENTURY. IN THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS
WE HAVE COPED WITH THE DISTURBANCES OF THE GANG OF
FOUR. NOW WE ARE STRIVING TO MAKE UP FOR TIME LOST
BY THAT PROBLEM. BY THE END OF THE CENTURY WE CAN
ACHIEVE THE FOUR MODERNIZATIONS AND WE WOULD LIKE TO
DEVELOP OUR ECONOMY AT A RAPID RATE. THERE WILL BE

MORE INTERCHANGE WITH COUNTRIES ADVANCED IN SCIENCE
AND TECHNOLOGY. WE WANT TO INTRODUCE SOPHISTICATED
FOREIGN TECHNOLOGY AND EQUIPMENT IN ORDER TO SPEED
UP OUR DEVELOPMENT. WITH THE GROWTH OF OUR DOMESTIC
PRODUCTION, OUR FOREIGN TRADE WILL ALSO BE DEVELOPED.
SO THE PROSPECTS ARE THAT THERE WILL BE CONSIDERABLE
DEVELOPMENT IN FOREIGN TRADE. WE WILL SIGN A GENERAL
TRADE AGREEMENT WITH THE COMMON MARKET. OUR RELATIONS WITH THE EC COUNTRIES ARE VERY GOOD. AFTER
SIGNING THIS TRADE AGREEMENT, TRADE WITH THE EC WILL
DEVELOP FURTHER. THE NEXT STEP IS TO IMPORT QUITE A
NUMBER OF COMPLETE PLANTS. I WOULD BE INTERESTED IN
YOUR VIEWS.
5. CRANSTON: I REPRESENT THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA.
OUR INTEREST IN TRADE WITH CHINA IS EQUAL TO OR
GREATER THAN THAT OF ANY OTHER STATE, IN VIEW OF OUR
LOCATION ON THE WEST COAST AND THE MANY PRODUCTS
WHICH WE HAVE TO EXPORT. WE ALSO HOPE TO IMPORT
PRODUCTS FROM CHINA.
6. LI: CAN YOU COMMENT ON THE KINDS OF PRODUCTS?
7. CRANSTON: WE HAVE DIVERSE INTERESTS; I WILL YIELD
TO OTHERS.

8. WHALEN: WE HAVE A LAW WHICH CONTROLS THE EXPORT
OF HIGH TECHNOLOGY ITEMS. I AM THE RANKING REPUBLICAN MEMBEROF THE SUBCOMMITTEE WHICH EXERCISES
JURISDICTION OVER THIS LAW. LATER THIS MONTH, WE
WILL HOLD HEARINGS CONCERNING THE EXECUTION OF THIS LAW.
I UNDERSTAND YOUR GOVERNMENT HAS SEVERAL APPLICATIONS PENDING. I WONDER WHETHER YOU COULD LIST
THESE SO WE CAN MAKE A PROPER INQUIRY DURING THIS
INVESTIGATION.
9. LI: REGARDING YOUR STATE?
10. WHALEN: NOT NECESSARILY. IN GENERAL, SOME
PRODUCTS MUST HAVE AN APPROVED LICENSE FOR EXPORT
FROM THE US. I WANT TO KNOW THE STATUS OF THESE
APPLICATIONS SO THEY CAN BE CONSIDERED WHEN THE MATTER
COMES BEFORE MY SUBCOMMITTEE.
11. LI: THERE ARE SOME PROBLEMS. MR. DEAN KNOWS
VERY WELL.
12. WHALEN: I JUST WANT TO KNOW WHICH APPLICATIONS

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014

ARE PENDING.
13. LI: ELECTRONIC COMPUTERS AND SOPHISTICATED
TECHNICAL EQUIPMENT. PERHAPS WE CAN GET A LIST. MR.
DEAN KNOWS THIS VERY WELL.
14. HART: CONCERNING US EXPORTS OF GRAIN TO CHINA,
CAN WE HAVE YOUR OPINION AS TO WHETHER IT IS YOUR
POLICY TO FAVOR TRADITIONAL TRADING PARTNERS,
ESPECIALLY CANADA AND AUSTRALIA? IS THE FACT THAT
WE HAVE NOT MET YOUR REQUESTS TO PURCHASE HIGH
TECHNOLOGY AND COMPUTERS THE REASON FOR NOT FAVORING
THE US IN AGRICULTURAL TRADE?

15. LI: YOU HAVE CONNECTED THESE THINGS TOGETHER?
16. HART: YES, VERY CLEARLY (LAUGHTER). IN TERMS
OF AGRICULTURAL PURCHASES, WHICH IS MORE IMPORTANT
TO YOU; OUR WILLINGNESS TO SELL HIGH TECHNOLOGY OR
NORMALIZATION?
17. LI: WHAT DO YOU THINK MR. DEAN?
18. DEAN: I AM SURE THE SENATOR WOULD RATHER HEAR
THE MINISTER'S REPLY.
19. LI: GENERALLY SPEAKING, TRADE AS A WHOLE IS
INFLUENCED BY WHETHER OR NOT WE HAVE DIPLOMATIC
RELATIONS. WE PURCHASE AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS ACCORDING TO OUR REQUIREMENTS AND POSSIBILITIES, BUT THERE
WILL BE SOME CONNECTION WITH DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS. WE
WILL NOT FORGET OUR OLD TRADING PARTNERS CANADA AND
AUSTRALIA. IN THE PAST, WE HAVE HAD LONG TERM AGREEMENTS WITH THESE TWO COUNTRIES. IF WE PURCHASE GRAIN
WE WILL TRY TO PURCHASE FROM THIRD COUNTRIES,
INCLUDING THE US, A WELL. FOR EXAMPLE, IN 1973 AND
1974 WE PURCHASED FROM THIRD PARTIES, INCLUDING US
SOYBEANS. ANYWAY, WE IMPORT AND EXPORT AGRICLUTURAL
PRODUCTS EVERY YEAR IN ORDER TO BALANCE OUR PRODUCTION. WE EXPORT RICE AND IMPORT WHEAT. OUR WHEAT
OUTPUT IS NOT SO SMALL, A LITTLE SMALLER THAN YOURS,
BUT WE HAVE A BIG POPULATION SO WE WILL CONTINUE TO
IMPORT. APART FROM THESE TWO OLD FRIENDS, WE WILL
ALSO CONSIDER PURCHASES FROM YOU, BUT NOT IN AS BIG
QUANTITIES AS THE USSR. WHY DO THEY (THE SOVIETS)
PURCHASE SUCH LARGE QUANTITIES. THEY DON'T HAVE A BIG

CONSIDER THIS IN THE FUTURE.
20. RICHMOND: CONCERNING 1978 WHEAT PURCHASES, IF
THE US WERE TO PROVIDE FOR LONG-TERM PAYMENT
ARRANGEMENTS -- NOT CREDIT, WE KNOW YOU DON'T LIKE
THAT -- WOULD THAT INFLUENCE YOUR PURCHASES OF US

REDUCE THE INTEREST. FOR AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS WOULD
DEFERRED PAYMENTS BE POSSIBLE? WOULD YOU LIKE TO

22. RICHMOND: IN CONGRESS THERE IS A BILL WHICH WOULD
GIVE LONG-TERM CREDIT TO COUNTRIES LIKE CHINA IF THEY
WANT IT TO PURCHASE WHEAT, CORN, SOYBEANS, ETC.
23. CRANSTON: IT COULD ALSO BE SHORT-TERM.

ADVANCED LEVEL OF THOSE COUNTRIES YOU MENTIONED.
MAYBE NOT THE LEVEL (ATTAINED) AT THE END OF THE
CENTURY, BECAUSE YOUR LEVEL WILL ALSO BE RISING IN
THE FUTURE. OF COURSE THIS INVOLVES MANY ASPECTS.
WE WOULD LIKE TO REFORM AND STRENGTHEN SCIENTIFIC
RESEARCH, STRENGTHEN EDUCATION, AND RAISE THE LEVEL
OF HIGH SCHOOLS AND UNIVERSITIES. IN THE MEANTIME,
WE WISH TO DEVELOP INDUSTRY AS WELL AS AGRICULTURE.
SPEAKING OF DEVELOPING INFRASTRUCTURE, WE WILL GIVE
PRIORITY TO DEVELOPING BASIC INDUSTRIES. FIRST OF
ALL, POWER, FUEL AND TRANSPORTATION SECTORS; AND THEN
METALLURGICAL AND BASIC CHEMICAL INDUSTRIES. SO LONG
AS WE HAVE THE CHEMICAL AND METALLURGICAL INDUSTRIES
AS A BASE, WE CAN DEVELOP OTHER INDUSTRIES. THIS IS
OUR GENERAL PROGRAM.
28. RICHMOND: WHAT CONSTITUTES THE MAJOR OBSTACLE
TO THE LEVEL OF DEVELOPMENT YOU SEEK TO ACHIEVE BY
THE END OF THE CENTURY? HOW DO YOU GO ABOUT ACCUMULATING THE CAPITAL WHICH WILL BE NECESSARY TO REACH
THIS LEVEL OF DEVELOPMENT BY THE END OF THE CENTURY?
29. LI: I DON'T THINK THERE ARE ANY OBSTACLES. MOST
OF THE OBSTACLES WE WILL OVERCOME. FIRST WE WILL
TRAIN OUR CADRES, DEVELOP SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH, RAISE
EDUCATIONAL LEVELS, AND DEVELOP OUR FUEL, ENERGY, AND
COMMUNICATIONS INDUSTRIES. THEN WE WILL DEVELOP
METALLURGICALAND CHEMICAL INDUSTRIES. WHAT I MEAN
IS, BASIC CHEMICAL INDUSTRIES FOR SEMI-MANUFACTURED
PRODUCTS. ALSO THERE IS A FOOD PROBLEM -- TO FEED
ALL THE PEOPLE WE MUST DEVELOP AGRICULTURE. IN THIS
I INCLUDE AGRICULTURE, FORESTRY, ANIMAL HUSBANDRY,

ANIMAL BYPRODUCTS AND FISHERIES. IN THE VARIOUS PARTS
OF OUR COUNTRY THERE ARE CLIMATE AND GEOGRAPHICAL
DIFFERENCES. THEREFORE WE MUST TAKE ADVANTAGE OF
FOREIGN TRADE TO ALANCE ALL THESE REQUIREMENTS. FIRST
WE MUST PRODUCE FOR THE INTERNAL MARKET, THEN FOR
FOREIGN TRADE. IF WE HAVE SURPLUS PRODUCTS WE MAY
EXPORT THEM. SOME PRODUCTS WE MAY PRODUCE ESPECIALLY
FOR THE INTERNATIONAL MARKET. WHAT IS YOUR VIEW?
FOR EXAMPLE,WHAT ABOUT OIL; IN HOW MANY YEARS WILL
ALL THE WORLD'S OIL BE CONSUMED?
30. ABOUREZK: AT THE PRESENT RATE, 100 YEARS.
31. LI: ALL OF US WILL HAVE DISAPPEARED IN 100
YEARS. (LAUGHTER)
32. CRANSTON: DO YOU EXPECT TO EXPORT SIZEABLE
AMOUNTS OF OIL?
33. LI: YES, WE WILL EXPORT SIZEABLE AMOUNTS OF OIL.
34. MATHIAAS: YOU ASKED HOW LONG WILL WORLD OIL
SUPPLIES LAST. I DON'T BELIEVE THAT THIS IS REALLY
THE QUESTION. THE QUESTION IS: HOW EXPENSIVE WILL
OIL BECOME IN A FEW YEARS? THE CHALLENGE TO THE
ECONOMIES OF THE NATIONS OF THE WORLD IS TO FIND
ALTERNATIVE ENERGY SOURCES. THIS IS A SEARCH WHICH
REQUIREES COOPERATION AND COORDINATION OF EFFORT AT A
HIGH LEVEL. WHEN I SUGGEST THIS, IT IS NOT BECAUSE
I AM LOOKING FOR HELP OR WANT TO GIVE HELP, BUT JUST
BECAUSE I THINK IT IS THE ONLY WAY WE WILL ALL SURVIVE.
35. LI: I HAVE MY OWN VIEW ON THIS POINT. IF
EVERYTHING IS DEPENDENT ON OIL, THE PERIOD FOR CONSUMING THE WORLD'S SUPPLIES WOULD BE SHORTENED TO
EVEN LESS THAN 100 YEARS. FIVE TO SIX YEARS AGO

SOME COUNTRIES SAID IF THERE WERE LESS CONSUMPTION
OF COAL AND MORE CONSUMPTION OF OIL, THIS WOULD BE
AN ADVANCE. MANY PEOPLE WANTED TO DO IT THIS WAY.
MAYBE YOU HAVE TURNED TO THIS WAY EARLIER THAN WE.
AT PRESENT, HOWEVER, THE TENDENCY IS TO CONSUME LESS
OIL AND MORE COAL. DO YOU SHARE MY VIEW?
36. MATHIAS: THAT IS NOW THE PROGRAM IN THE US -- TO
CONSUME MORE COAL AND LESS OIL. SEVERAL YEARS AGO

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
WE ALL LAUGHED WHEN THE SHAH OF IRAN SAID OIL IS TOO
VALUABLE TO BURN. NOW WE KNOW HE WAS RIGHT.
37. LI: MAYBE WE HAVE THE SAME SITUATION AS IN THE
US. AT PRESENT LEVELS, WE CAN CONSUME COAL FOR
1000 YEARS. THEN WHAT HAPPENS AFTER THE COAL IS EXHAUSTED?
I AM OPTIMISTIC THAT THERE WILL BE NEW ENERGY SOURCES
BY THAT TIME. CERTAINLY NEW INVENTIONS BY THAT TIME.
WHEN I TALK WITH FOREIGN FRIENDS, THEY ARE NOT AS
OPTIMISTIC AS ME. I SAY OIL IS NOT ENOUGH. WE MAY
EXPORT SOME, BUT NOT IN BIG QUANTITIES. WE WILL
DEVELOP OUR OIL INDUSTRY. YOU ARE THE SECOND LARGEST
OIL PRODUCING COUNTRY. OUR OIL OUTPUT WILL BE RAISED
IF WE DEVELOP OUR OIL INDUSTRY. SO WE WILL CATCH UP,
NOT ONLY WITH YOU, BUT WITH OTHER COUNTRIES AS WELL.
38. CRANSTON: I SHARE YOUR OPTIMISM ABOUT THE
DEVELOPMENT OF NEW SOURCES OF ENERGY. THE ONLY
QUESTION IS HOW FAST WE WILL BE ABLE TO DO THIS.
39. NEAL: THE MAIN AREAS WHICH YOU MENTIONED WHICH YOU WANT TO
ADVANCE ARE ALSO AREAS WHERE WE, TOO,
ARE STRONG, FOR EXAMPLE, POWER, TRANSPORTATION,

WE SELL THESE KINDS OF PLANTS -- POWER PLANTS,
TRANSPORTATION EQUIPMENT, ETC. WE OFFER DEFERRED
PAYMENTS THROUGH OUR EXPORT/IMPORT BANK OF 7-10
YEARS, OR EVEN LONGER. THIS IS LONGER THAN ANY
PRIVATE COMMERCIAL BANK WILL OFFER. I AM VERY
INTERESTED IN THE EXPORT/IMPORT BANK BECAUSE I AM
CHAIRMAN OF THE SUBCOMMITTEE WHICH HAS RESPONSIBILITY
FOR IT. I WOULD VERY MUCH LIKE TO KNOW IF YOU ARE
INTERESTED IN THIS KIND OF FACILITY.
40. LI: IN THE PAST OUR PRACTICE ON DEFERRED PAYMENT WAS FOR A TERM OF NOT LONGER THAN FIVE YEARS.
NOW MANY FOREIGN FRIENDS ARE COMING TO MAKE SUGGESTIONS TO US. FIRST THEY WANT TO GIVE US CREDIT. WE
CAN'T RECEIVE IT. THAN LATER ON, THEY PROPOSE DEFERRED PAYMENTS FOR LONGER PERIOD. WE NOW CONSIDER
THAT WE MAY HAVE SOME FLEXIBILITY IN THIS MATTER.

A COUNTRY WITH VAST AREA. WE CANNOT RELY MAINLY ON
FOREIGN TRADE. YOUR PERCENTAGE OF FOREIGN TRADE IS
NOT AS BIG AS THAT OF JAPAN; I MEAN PERCENTAGE OF
FOREIGN TRADE TO GNP. OUR PERCENTAGE MAY BE EVEN

51. LI: THE STRUCTURE OF OUR IMPORTS HAS CHANGED
FROM TIME-TO-TIME. IN 1950-51, THE BEGINNING OF
LIBERATION, WE IMPORTED MANY THINGS WHICH WE EXPORT
NOW. SO THE STRUCTURE CHANGES. AT THAT TIME WE
IMPORTED OIL; THIS CONTINUED UNTIL 1962-63 WHEN THE
IMPORTS STOPPED. LATER ON WE EXPORTED OIL. WE ALSO
INTEND TO CONTINUE TO EXPORT COAL. WE IMPORT FERTILIZER AND FERTILIZER MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT, INCLUDING
FROM THE US. FOR EXAMPLE, THE AMMONIA FERTILIZER
PLANTS FROM THE KELLOGG CO. BUT THESE SEVERAL
PLANTS ARE NOT ENOUGH. WE HAVE MANY PEOPLE. STILL,
IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO IMPORT CONTINUOUSLY. BUT

THAT EVERYONE HAD ENOUGH FOOD. THIS IS THE DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN OUR MONEY AND YOUR MONEY. IN CHINA, EVEN
IF YOU HAVE MORE MONEY, YOU CANNOT BUY FOOD EXCEEDING

WE WILL TRY TO PURCHASE FROM THIRD COUNTRIES,

29. LI: I DON'T THINK THERE ARE ANY OBSTACLES. MOST
OF THE OBSTACLES WE WILL OVERCOME. FIRST WE WILL
TRAIN OUR CADRES, DEVELOP SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH, RAISE
EDUCATIONAL LEVELS, AND DEVELOP OUR FUEL, ENERGY, AND
COMMUNICATIONS INDUSTRIES. THEN WE WILL DEVELOP
METALLURGICALAND CHEMICAL INDUSTRIES. WHAT I MEAN
IS, BASIC CHEMICAL INDUSTRIES FOR SEMI-MANUFACTURED
PRODUCTS. ALSO THERE IS A FOOD PROBLEM -- TO FEED
ALL THE PEOPLE WE MUST DEVELOP AGRICULTURE. IN THIS
I INCLUDE AGRICULTURE, FORESTRY, ANIMAL HUSBANDRY,

ANIMAL BYPRODUCTS AND FISHERIES. IN THE VARIOUS PARTS
OF OUR COUNTRY THERE ARE CLIMATE AND GEOGRAPHICAL
DIFFERENCES. THEREFORE WE MUST TAKE ADVANTAGE OF
FOREIGN TRADE TO ALANCE ALL THESE REQUIREMENTS. FIRST
WE MUST PRODUCE FOR THE INTERNAL MARKET, THEN FOR
FOREIGN TRADE. IF WE HAVE SURPLUS PRODUCTS WE MAY
EXPORT THEM. SOME PRODUCTS WE MAY PRODUCE ESPECIALLY
FOR THE INTERNATIONAL MARKET. WHAT IS YOUR VIEW?
FOR EXAMPLE,WHAT ABOUT OIL; IN HOW MANY YEARS WILL
ALL THE WORLD'S OIL BE CONSUMED?
30. ABOUREZK: AT THE PRESENT RATE, 100 YEARS.
31. LI: ALL OF US WILL HAVE DISAPPEARED IN 100
YEARS. (LAUGHTER)
32. CRANSTON: DO YOU EXPECT TO EXPORT SIZEABLE
AMOUNTS OF OIL?
33. LI: YES, WE WILL EXPORT SIZEABLE AMOUNTS OF OIL.
34. MATHIAAS: YOU ASKED HOW LONG WILL WORLD OIL
SUPPLIES LAST. I DON'T BELIEVE THAT THIS IS REALLY
THE QUESTION. THE QUESTION IS: HOW EXPENSIVE WILL
OIL BECOME IN A FEW YEARS? THE CHALLENGE TO THE
ECONOMIES OF THE NATIONS OF THE WORLD IS TO FIND
ALTERNATIVE ENERGY SOURCES. THIS IS A SEARCH WHICH
REQUIREES COOPERATION AND COORDINATION OF EFFORT AT A
HIGH LEVEL. WHEN I SUGGEST THIS, IT IS NOT BECAUSE
I AM LOOKING FOR HELP OR WANT TO GIVE HELP, BUT JUST
BECAUSE I THINK IT IS THE ONLY WAY WE WILL ALL SURVIVE.
35. LI: I HAVE MY OWN VIEW ON THIS POINT. IF
EVERYTHING IS DEPENDENT ON OIL, THE PERIOD FOR CONSUMING THE WORLD'S SUPPLIES WOULD BE SHORTENED TO
EVEN LESS THAN 100 YEARS. FIVE TO SIX YEARS AGO

SOME COUNTRIES SAID IF THERE WERE LESS CONSUMPTION
OF COAL AND MORE CONSUMPTION OF OIL, THIS WOULD BE
AN ADVANCE. MANY PEOPLE WANTED TO DO IT THIS WAY.
MAYBE YOU HAVE TURNED TO THIS WAY EARLIER THAN WE.
AT PRESENT, HOWEVER, THE TENDENCY IS TO CONSUME LESS
OIL AND MORE COAL. DO YOU SHARE MY VIEW?
36. MATHIAS: THAT IS NOW THE PROGRAM IN THE US -- TO
CONSUME MORE COAL AND LESS OIL. SEVERAL YEARS AGO

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
WE ALL LAUGHED WHEN THE SHAH OF IRAN SAID OIL IS TOO
VALUABLE TO BURN. NOW WE KNOW HE WAS RIGHT.
37. LI: MAYBE WE HAVE THE SAME SITUATION AS IN THE
US. AT PRESENT LEVELS, WE CAN CONSUME COAL FOR
1000 YEARS. THEN WHAT HAPPENS AFTER THE COAL IS EXHAUSTED?
I AM OPTIMISTIC THAT THERE WILL BE NEW ENERGY SOURCES
BY THAT TIME. CERTAINLY NEW INVENTIONS BY THAT TIME.
WHEN I TALK WITH FOREIGN FRIENDS, THEY ARE NOT AS
OPTIMISTIC AS ME. I SAY OIL IS NOT ENOUGH. WE MAY
EXPORT SOME, BUT NOT IN BIG QUANTITIES. WE WILL
DEVELOP OUR OIL INDUSTRY. YOU ARE THE SECOND LARGEST
OIL PRODUCING COUNTRY. OUR OIL OUTPUT WILL BE RAISED
IF WE DEVELOP OUR OIL INDUSTRY. SO WE WILL CATCH UP,
NOT ONLY WITH YOU, BUT WITH OTHER COUNTRIES AS WELL.
38. CRANSTON: I SHARE YOUR OPTIMISM ABOUT THE
DEVELOPMENT OF NEW SOURCES OF ENERGY. THE ONLY
QUESTION IS HOW FAST WE WILL BE ABLE TO DO THIS.
39. NEAL: THE MAIN AREAS WHICH YOU MENTIONED WHICH YOU WANT TO
ADVANCE ARE ALSO AREAS WHERE WE, TOO,
ARE STRONG, FOR EXAMPLE, POWER, TRANSPORTATION,

OIL DRILLING EQUIPMENT AND COMMUNICATION EQUIPMENT.
WE SELL THESE KINDS OF PLANTS -- POWER PLANTS,
TRANSPORTATION EQUIPMENT, ETC. WE OFFER DEFERRED
PAYMENTS THROUGH OUR EXPORT/IMPORT BANK OF 7-10
YEARS, OR EVEN LONGER. THIS IS LONGER THAN ANY
PRIVATE COMMERCIAL BANK WILL OFFER. I AM VERY
INTERESTED IN THE EXPORT/IMPORT BANK BECAUSE I AM
CHAIRMAN OF THE SUBCOMMITTEE WHICH HAS RESPONSIBILITY
FOR IT. I WOULD VERY MUCH LIKE TO KNOW IF YOU ARE
INTERESTED IN THIS KIND OF FACILITY.
40. LI: IN THE PAST OUR PRACTICE ON DEFERRED PAYMENT WAS FOR A TERM OF NOT LONGER THAN FIVE YEARS.
NOW MANY FOREIGN FRIENDS ARE COMING TO MAKE SUGGESTIONS TO US. FIRST THEY WANT TO GIVE US CREDIT. WE
CAN'T RECEIVE IT. THAN LATER ON, THEY PROPOSE DEFERRED PAYMENTS FOR LONGER PERIOD. WE NOW CONSIDER
THAT WE MAY HAVE SOME FLEXIBILITY IN THIS MATTER.

A VERY LOW QUANTITY. WE MAINLY RELY ON OUR OWN PRODUCTS. EVERY YEAR WE DO A LOT OF FORESTRY WORK AND
CUT MANY TREES. WE ALSO IMPORT SOME TIMBER FROM THE

FROM OTHER COUNTRIES. WE IMPORT SPECIAL KINDS OF TIMBER

44. ASST SEC OF STATE BENNETT: CONCERNING THE
FOUR MODERNIZATIONS, YOU STATED CHINA WOULD ENGAGE IN
TRADE TO BALANCE THE DOMESTIC ECONOMY (TO LEVEL OUT
SUPPLIES) AND -- TO SOME DEGREE -- TO PRODUCE FOR
EXPORT.
45. LI: AND ALSO, WE HAVE SOME PRODUCTS MANUFACTURED ESPECIALLY FOR FOREIGN MARKETS.
46. BENNETT: WILL THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT USE TRADE
TO INCREASE SELF-SUFFICIENCY OR, AFTER MODERNIZATION
HAS BEEN ACHIEVED, TRY TO USE FOREIGN TRADE
TO INCREASE WEALTH? I WANT TO GAIN SOME IMPRESSION ABOUT
HOW ACTIVE CHINA WILL BE IN FOREIGN TRADE IN THE
FUTURE.
47. LI: WE WILL USE IT FOR BOTH PURPOSES. WE ARE
A COUNTRY WITH VAST AREA. WE CANNOT RELY MAINLY ON
FOREIGN TRADE. YOUR PERCENTAGE OF FOREIGN TRADE IS
NOT AS BIG AS THAT OF JAPAN; I MEAN PERCENTAGE OF
FOREIGN TRADE TO GNP. OUR PERCENTAGE MAY BE EVEN
SMALLER THAN YOURS, THAT IS OUR SITUATION -- MUCH
SMALLER. SO WE MAINLY RELY ON OUR OWN EFFORTS TO
ACHIEVE SELF-SUFFICIENCY, SUPPLEMENTED BY FOREIGN
TRADE. FOREIGN TRADE HAS A PURPOSE DIFFERENT FROM

TO FOREIGN TRADE.
48. CRANSTON DO YOU CONSIDER FOREIGN TRADE
IMPORTANT FOR THE ACCUMULATION OF CAPITAL NECESSARY
FOR INTERNAL DEVELOPMENT?
49. LI: OF COURSE WE WILL ACCUMULATE SOME CAPITAL,
THERE IS NO QUESTION ABOUT THIS. WE USE FOREIGN EXCHANGE TO IMPORT GOODS. WE ACCUMULATE THESE GOODS.
50. DIRECTOR, INR/REA HOROWITZ: WE SEEM TO BE TALKING ABOUT HOW CHINA WILL GENERATE THE FOREIGN EXCHANGE
NECESSARY TO MEET ITS NEEDS FOR MODERNIZATION. YOU
HAVE INDICATED SOME AREAS WHERE YOU HOPE TO INCREASE

STITUTION.
51. LI: THE STRUCTURE OF OUR IMPORTS HAS CHANGED
FROM TIME-TO-TIME. IN 1950-51, THE BEGINNING OF
LIBERATION, WE IMPORTED MANY THINGS WHICH WE EXPORT
NOW. SO THE STRUCTURE CHANGES. AT THAT TIME WE
IMPORTED OIL; THIS CONTINUED UNTIL 1962-63 WHEN THE
IMPORTS STOPPED. LATER ON WE EXPORTED OIL. WE ALSO
INTEND TO CONTINUE TO EXPORT COAL. WE IMPORT FERTILIZER AND FERTILIZER MANUFACTURING EQUIPMENT, INCLUDING
FROM THE US. FOR EXAMPLE, THE AMMONIA FERTILIZER
PLANTS FROM THE KELLOGG CO. BUT THESE SEVERAL
PLANTS ARE NOT ENOUGH. WE HAVE MANY PEOPLE. STILL,
IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO IMPORT CONTINUOUSLY. BUT
THIS WILL BE SUFFICIENT FOR A CERTAIN TIME. WE

FOR EXPORT. FOR EXAMPLE, WE EXPORT MACHINERY TO
WORLD MARKETS, INCLUDING SOME TO YOUR COUNTRY.
SOME MACHINERY WILL NOT CONTINUE TO PRODUCE BUT
WE WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO. WE ALSO SELL TO THE
EUROPEAN MARKET. IN THE FUTURE, WE WILL ALSO PRODUCE HIGH TECHNOLOGY ITEMS.
52. LUGAR: IN 1978, WILL CHINA IMPORT MORE WHEAT
THAN 1977? WILL YOU MAKE AN ESTIMATE OF 1978
IMPORTS?

SOME COMPARISONS IN THE INTERNATIONAL MARKET AND SOME
FACTORS WILL BE BEYOND MAN'S CONTROL; THEY WILL
BE INFLUENCED BY GOD (LAUGHTER). I AM REFERRING TO
THE WEATHER.

TRAIN, FIRST OF ALL, WE NEEDED TO FEED THE PEOPLE.
EVEN IF A PERSON HAD MUCH MONEY HE COULD NOT GET MORE
FOOD THAN OTHERS. IN THIS WAY IT COULD BE ASSURED
THAT EVERYONE HAD ENOUGH FOOD. THIS IS THE DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN OUR MONEY AND YOUR MONEY. IN CHINA, EVEN
IF YOU HAVE MORE MONEY, YOU CANNOT BUY FOOD EXCEEDING
YOUR NEEDS. SO EVERYONE GETS ENOUGH.
66. HOROWITZ: YOUR EXPORTS TO THE US HAVE BEEN
INCREASING AND YOUR IMPORTS FROM US DECREASING
SINCE 1974 WHEN WE HAD A LARGE SURPLUS. NOW TRADE
IS ROUGHLY IN BALANCE, OR YOU MAY HAVE A SURPLUS.
LOOKING INTO THE FUTURE, DO YOU THINK THE TRADE
