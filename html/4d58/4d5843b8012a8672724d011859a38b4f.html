		<h3>Tor</h3>
		<p><a href="https://www.torproject.org">Tor</a> is an encrypted anonymising network that makes it harder to intercept internet communications, or see where communications are coming from or going to.</p>
		<p>In order to use the WikiLeaks public submission system as detailed above you can download the Tor Browser Bundle, which is a Firefox-like browser available for Windows, Mac OS X and GNU/Linux and pre-configured to connect using the anonymising system Tor.</p>
		<h4>Tails</h4>
		<p>If you are at high risk and you have the capacity to do so, you can also access the submission system through a secure operating system called <a href="https://tails.boum.org">Tails</a>. Tails is an operating system launched from a USB stick or a DVD that aim to leaves no traces when the computer is shut down after use and automatically routes your internet traffic through Tor. Tails will require you to have either a USB stick or a DVD at least 4GB big and a laptop or desktop computer.</p>

		<h3>Tips</h3>
		<p>Our submission system works hard to preserve your anonymity, but we recommend you also take some of your own precautions. Please review these basic guidelines. </p>
		<div>
			<h4>1. Contact us if you have specific problems</h4>
			<p>If you have a very large submission, or a submission with a complex format, or are a high-risk source, please <a href="#submit_help_contact">contact us</a>. In our experience it is always possible to find a custom solution for even the most seemingly difficult situations.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h4>2. What computer to use</h4>
			<p>If the computer you are uploading from could subsequently be audited in an investigation, consider using a computer that is not easily tied to you. Technical users can also use <a href="https://tails.boum.org">Tails</a> to help ensure you do not leave any records of your submission on the computer.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h4>3. Do not talk about your submission to others</h4>
			<p>If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in source protection – it is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This includes other media organisations.</p>
		</div>

	</div>

		<h3>After</h3>

		<div>
			<h4>1. Do not talk about your submission to others</h4>
			<p>If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in source protection – it is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This includes other media organisations.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h4>2. Act normal</h4>
			<p>If you are a high-risk source, avoid saying anything or doing anything after submitting which might promote suspicion. In particular, you should try to stick to your normal routine and behaviour.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h4>3. Remove traces of your submission</h4>
			<p>If you are a high-risk source and the computer you prepared your submission on, or uploaded it from, could subsequently be audited in an investigation, we recommend that you format and dispose of the computer hard drive and any other storage media you used.</p>
			<p>In particular, hard drives retain data after formatting which may be visible to a digital forensics team and flash media (USB sticks, memory cards and SSD drives) retain data even after a secure erasure. If you used flash media to store sensitive data, it is important to destroy the media.</p>
			<p>If you do this and are a high-risk source you should make sure there are no traces of the clean-up, since such traces themselves may draw suspicion.</p>
			<div>
				<h4>4. If you face legal action</h4>
				<p>If a legal action is brought against you as a result of your submission, there are organisations that may help you. The Courage Foundation is an international organisation dedicated to the protection of journalistic sources. You can find more details at <a href="https://www.couragefound.org">https://www.couragefound.org</a>.</p>

		<p>WikiLeaks publishes documents of political or historical importance that are censored or otherwise suppressed. We specialise in strategic global publishing and large archives.</p>
		<p>The following is the address of our secure site where you can anonymously upload your documents to WikiLeaks editors. You can only access this submissions system through Tor. (See our <a href="#submit_help_tor">Tor tab</a> for more information.) We also advise you to read our <a href="#submit_help_tips">tips for sources</a> before submitting.</p>

			<!--<div>
				Copy this address into your Tor browser. Advanced users, if they wish, can also add a further layer of encryption to their submission using <a href="#submit_wlkey">our public PGP key</a>.
			</div>-->
		</div>

		<p>If you cannot use Tor, or your submission is very large, or you have specific requirements, WikiLeaks provides several alternative methods. <a href="#submit_help_contact">Contact us</a> to discuss how to proceed.</p>

THERE ARE LIMITS TO SINO-US TRADE UNTIL AFTER NORMALIZATION.

3. VICE PREMIER LI WELCOMED MR. AND MRS. ROGERS AND

OTHER MEMBERS OF THE PARTY WARMLY. AFTER SOME INITIAL
COURTESIES, MR. ROGERS SAID THAT ON HIS PREVIOUS VISIT

IN 1972 WITH PRESIDENT NIXON HE HAD MET PREMIER CHOU
EN-LAI BUT HAD NOT HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO MEET CHAIRMAN
MAO TSE-TUNG. DURING THAT VISIT PREMIER CHOU HAD









EXPRESSED A REAL DESIRE TO VISIT NEW YORK AT THE UNITED
NATIONS. HE REGRETTED THAT THAT HAD NOT BEEN POSSIBLE.

HE SAID THAT HE WAS AWARE THAT CHINA HAD SUFFERED GREAT
LOSSES WITH THE DEATH OF PREMIER CHOU AND CHAIRMAN MAO.

BUT HE SENSED THAT THERE HAD BEEN A RECOVERY FROM THESE
LOSSES AND THAT THE GOVERNMENT WAS VERY HEALTHY.


4. LI: OUR GREAT TEACHER AND LEADER MAO TSE-TUNG
PASSED AWAY LAST YEAR AS DID PREMIER CHOU EN-LAI AND

CHU TE BUT WE HAVE RECOVERED. YOU ARE ONE OF THE
PARTICIPANTS OF THOSE WHO HELPED TO IMPROVE RELATIONS

BETWEEN CHINA AND THE UNITED STATES WHILE PRESIDENT
NIXON WAS IN OFFICE. I AM CONVINCED THAT BOTH THE

CHINESE AND AMERICAN PEOPLE WELCOMED SUCH A DEVELOPMENT
AND THE CHINESE PEOPLE WELCOME YOU BACK FOR A VISIT.


5. ROGERS: I AM SURE THAT ALL AMERICANS SUPPORTED THE

NIXON VISIT AND THE SHANGHAI COMMUNIQUE AND THAT THEY
ARE HAPPY THAT RELATIONS HAVE IMPROVED.


6. LI: YES.


7. ROGERS: MANY AMERICANS HAVE VISITED YOUR COUNTRY

AND SOME CHINESE DELEGATIONS HAVE GONE TO THE US.
THE SHANGHAI CMMUNIQUE MENTIONED THE DESIRE FOR AN
IMPROVEMENT IN TRADE. MR. LYET IS ONE OF OUR LEADING

CONFIDENTIAL


CONFIDENTIAL


PAGE 03    PEKING 02221 01 OF 04 301425Z


BUSINESSMEN AND HE IS VERY INTERESTED IN GETTING TO
KNOW YOUR COUNTRY. THIS IS HIS FIRST VISIT.


8. MR. LYET: I AM DELIGHTED TO BE HERE. I AM

INTERESTED NOT ONLY IN TRADE BUT IN THE IMPROVEMENT
OF RELATIONS BETWEEN OUR TWO PEOPLES.


9. LI: WELL WE MUST CONSIDER A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF

TRADE BUT AT THE PRESENT MOMENT TRADE CANNOT BE BUT
LIMITED. SINCE THERE IS NO NORMALIZATION OF RELATIONS,
TRADE WILL SUFFER CERTAIN LIMITS.


10. ROGERS: WE HOPE VERY MUCH TO HAVE THE SHANGHAI

COMMUNIQUE CARRIED OUT AND THAT NORMALIZATION WILL
OCCUR. WE UNDERSTAND THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT'S POSITION.

BUT IN THE MEANTIME TO CARRY OUT THE POLICICIES OF
CHAIRMAN MAO AND YOUR GOVERNMENT'S POLICY OF MODERNIZA-

TION OF AGRICULTURE, THERE IS SOME TRADE WHICH WOULD
BE BENEFICIAL TO BOTH SIDES. THE LAST TIME I WAS HERE

WE TALKED TO SOME OF YOUR OFFICIALS ABOUT THIS
SUBJECT AND SUBSEQUENTLY CHINA BOUGHT 10 BOEING 707'S. I

UNDERSTAND THAT PURCHASE WORKED OUT VERY WELL. DO









YOU LIKE THE 707'S BETTER THAN THE RUSSIAN PLANES?


11. LI: FRANKLY SPEAKING, THE 707'S ARE BETTER THAN
THE RUSSIAN PLANES.


12. MR. LYET: THE 707'S ARE EQUIPPED WITH SOME OF OUR (SPERRY

RAND) HYDRAULIC AND NAVIGATIONAL EQUIPMENT.

13. LI: MAY I KNOW IF THERE ARE ANY PRODUCTS THAT ARE USED IN

THE 707 THAT ARE MANUFACTURED IN WESTERN EUROPE?


14. LYET: I DON'T THINKSO.


15. ROGERS: THE VICE PREMIER HAS BEEN A LEADER IN

CHINA'S ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND HE HAS BEEN ACTIVE IN

THE FIELD OF FINANCE AND HE KNOWS MORE ABOUT ECONOMICS
THAN MOST PEOPLE IN THE WORLD.


16. LI: WELL THE WESTERN PRESS DESCRIBES ME AS AN
EXPERT ON ECONOMIC MATTERS. BUT I AM NOT WORTHY OF

BEING DESCRIBED AS AN EXPERT.


17. ROGERS: ANY TIME THE WESTERN PRESS SAYS ANYTHING


NOTE BY OC/T: DISTRIBUTION COORDINATED WITH MR CASWELL, S/S-O.

NICE YOU SHOULD ACCEPT IT AND NOT REJECT IT.


18. LI: BUT YOU HAVE TO ANALYZE IT. THEY DON'T ANALYZE ME. MY
CAREER WAS IN WARFARE. BUT I AM NOT A WAR FAMATIC.


19. ROGERS: I HAVE GREAT RESPECT FOR PRESIDENT EISENHOWER WHO

WAS ANOTHER GREAT SOLDIER AS WELL AS A GREAT PRESIDENT.


20. LI: AFTER THE LIBERATION OF OUR COUNTRY CHAIRMAN MAO WANTED
ME TO CONDUCT PARTY WORK IN LOCAL GOVERNMENT. THEN I GRADUALLY

BECAME ENGAGED IN ECONOMIC WORK AND CHANGED MY MILITARY UNIFORM
FOR CIVILIAN GARB. THE SOVIETS CLASSIFY US AS A GROUP OF WARLORDS

AND BUREAUCRATS. I AM CONSIDERED AS BOTH BY THE SOVIET UNION.
BUT ACTUALLY WE HOPE THERE WILL BE PEACE BUT WE DON'T WANT A

SHAM PEACE, WE WANT A GENUINE PEACE. PERHAPS YOUR VIEWS ARE CLEAR
TO YOU.


21. ROGERS: ON THIS POINT WE HAVE A COMMON INTEREST.

WE HAVE THE SAME DESIRE FOR PEACE AS YOU DO. THE
SHANGHAI COMMUNIQUE WAS A GOOD STEP IN THAT DIRECTION.


CONFIDENTIAL


CONFIDENTIAL


PAGE 02    PEKING 02221 02 OF 04 010551Z


22. LI: THE SHANGHAI COMMUNIQUE SHOULD BE CONSIDERED
AS A GOOD COMMUNIQUE. ALTHOUGH IT HAS NOT HELPED TO

SOLVE ISSUES TOTALLY AND COMPLETELY, IT CONSITTUTES
THE BASIS FOR THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CHINA AND THE U.S.

EVEN YOUR PRESIDENT JIMMY CARTER MENTIONED THAT THE
SHANGHAI COMMUNIQUE CONSTITUTES THE BASIS OF RELATIONS

BETWEEN CHINA AND THE U.S. THERE IS ANOTHER VERY
IMPORTANT PRINCIPLE IN THE SHANGHAI COMMUNIQUE, THAT IS

BOTH PARTIES WILL NOT SEEK HEGEMONY AND BOTH ARE
OPPOSED TO ANY OTHER PARTY SEEKING HEGEMONY. ANOTHER
VERY IMPORTANT PRINCIPLE IN THE SHANGHAI COMMUNIQUE IS

THAT THE CHINESE ON BOTH SIDES OF THE TAIWAN STRAITS
ACKNOWLEDGE THERE IS BUT ONE CHINA.ON OTHER ISSUES

EACH PARTY EXPOUNDED ITS OWN POINT OF VIEW. AS TO
SPECIFICS THE SHANGHAI COMMUNIQUE ALSO MENTIONED THAT

BOTH PARTIES COULD CONDUCT EXCHANGES OF PEOPLE AND SOME
TRADE. WHEN PRESIDENT NIXON WAS STILL IN OFFICE HIS

WAS A COURAGEOUS STEP. OF COURSE YOU WERE A PARTICIPANT. FORMER
PRESIDENT NIXON CAME TO CHINA AGAIN LAST YEAR. HOW IS HIS

HEALTH?


23. ROGERS: I SAW HIM SIX MONTHS AGO AND PLAYED GOLF









WITH HIM. HE IS IN GOOD HEALTH BUT MRS. NIXON IS NOT
VERY WELL. SHE HAS SUFFERED A STROKE. I WANT TO SAY

HOW MUCH HE APPRECIATED YOUR INVITATION. IT CAME AT
A TIME WHEN IT WAS VERY DIFFICULT FOR HIM.


24. LI: WE DO NOT FORGET OUR OLD FRIENDS. WELL

THERE ARE SOME OLD FRIENDS YOU CAN FORGET. BUT NIXON
HAS DONE SOME GOOD THINGS. AND WE WON'T FOREGET HIM.
PLEASE CONVEY MY REGARDS TO HIM WHEN YOU RETURN.


25. ROGERS: I WILL INDEED DO SO. I KNOW YOU DO NOT FORGET. I

CONFIDENTIAL


CONFIDENTIAL


PAGE 03    PEKING 02221 02 OF 04 010551Z


HAVE BEEN SO WELL TREATED ON THIS VISIT.


26. LI: YOU ARE AN OLD FRIEND AND ALWAYS WILL BE WELCOME.
BUT YOUR SO-CALLED OLD FRIENDS ON TAIWAN ARE NOT MUCH

FRIENDS. ON THIS POINT THE CHINESE PEOPLE ARE NOT HAPPY.


27. ROGERS. I UNDERSTAND. I AM NOT IN OFFICE AND NOT IN A POSITION
TO NEGOTIATE BUT I KNOW PRESIDENT CARTER STRONGLY
SUPPORTS THE SHANGHAI COMMUNIQUE. HOWEVER HE HAS ONLY

BEEN IN OFFICE FOR EIGHT MONTHS AND HE HAS MANY
PROBLEMS AND THEREFORE MUST MOVE WITH CARE. HE IS

ANXIOUS TO PROCEED IN A MANNER CONSISTENT WITH THE
SHANGHAI COMMUNIQUE. I HAVE NO CONCERN ABOUT THE POLICY OF THE

US IN CARRYING OUT WHAT PRESIDENT NIXON STARTED.


28. LI: WELL I HOPE SO BUT WE WILL HAVE TO WAIT AND SEE.


29: ROGERS: I THINK AS A RESULT OF SECRETARY VANCE'S VISIT TO
CHINA HE UNDERSTANDS YOU POSITION. SOME NEWS REPORTS

STATED THAT THERE WAS SOME FLEXIBILITY ON YOUR PART BUT

VERY WELL AND DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT IT IS FLEXIBLE.

DID NOT SAY SO IN THE TALKS AND OUR OWN STAND IS CONSISTENT.

YOUR GOVERNMENT'S POSITION AND YOUR PRIMCIPLES AND I

VANCE'S VISIT.


36. LI: YES, IT WAS USEFUL BECAUSE AFTER ALL

SECRETARY VANCE'S VISIT TO OUR COUNGRY WAS VERY USEFUL
ANBNWHEN WE EXCHANGE POINTS OF VIEW IT SI ALSO USEFUL.

WHEN PRESIDENT NIXON AND DR. KISSINGER CAME HERE OUR
ATTITUDE WAS THAT THEY WERE WELCOME TO COME. WE WELCOMED

TALKS, WHETHER TALKS GIVE QUICK RESULTS OR NOT
WEL STILL WELCOME THEM. IT IS BETTER TO HAVE MEETINGS
THAN NO MEETINGS. BUT IT IS A PITY THAT OUR OFFICIALS

CANNOT VISIT WASHINGTON BECAUSE OF THE CHIANG CHING-KUO

AREAS. I HOPE YOUR VISIT WILL HELP YOU TO BETTER UNDER-
STAND THE SITUATION IN OUR COUNTRY. LAST YEAR THERE

EMERGED IN OUR PARTY AN ANTI-PARTY CLIQUE. ACTUALLY IT
FIRST EMERGED SOME TIME AGO AND CHAIRMAN MAO CRITIZED

THEM WHEN HE WAS ALIVE. LAST YEAR CHAIRMAN HUA AND THE
CENTRAL COMMITTEE OF THE CHINESE COMMUNIST PARTY SMASHED

THE ANTI-PARTY CLIQUE OF THE GANG OF FOUR. IN THE
COURSE OF YOUR VISIT YOU CAN SEE FOR YOURSELF IF THE

SITUATION IS STABLE WHEN YOU GO OUT OF PEKING. WHEN
YOU GO AND SEE OTHER PARTS OF THE COUNTRY YOU CAN SEE
IF THE COMMON PEOPLE ARE SUPPORTING CHAIRMAN HUA IN

SMASHING THE GANG OF FOUR.


52. ROGERS: WE HAVE HAD SEVERAL TALKS WITH MR. HUA AND
OTHERS AND ARE CONVINCED THAT YOUR PEOPLE FULLY SUPPORT

YOUR NEW LEADERSHIP. THIS IS ALSO KNOWN BY THE AMERICAN
PEOPLE AND IT IS IMPORTANT FOR RELATIONS BETWEEN OUR

TWO COUNTRIES. WE THINK A STRONG, STABLE CHINA IS A
VERY IMPORTANT FACTOR IN WORLD PEACE. THERE IS A

FEELING IN SOME PARTS OF THE WORLD THAT THE US IS NOT
AS STRONG AS IT WAS BUT THIS IS NOT TRUE. OUR MILITARY

STRENGTH IS VERY GREAT. OUR ECONOMY IS STRONG. WE
WILL HAVE A GROWTH RATE THIS YEAR OF BETWEEN 3.5 AND 5 PERCENT.


53. LE: YOU SAID THAT SOME PEOPLE SAY THAT THE U.S.

IS NOT AS STRONG AS IT USED TO BE. FRANKLY SPEAKING,
WE ARE ONE OF THOSE WHO HAVE SUCH A VIEW BUT I DO AGREE
THAT YOUR ECONOMY IS STRONG.


54. ROGERS: I THINK IT IS A SERIOUS ERROR TO THINK THE

US IS NOT STRONG. IF WE HAD AN EMERGENCY OUR PRODUCTIVE
CAPACITY IS SO GREAT WE COULD QUICKLY GEAR UP TO MEET

THE EMERGENCY. MR. LYET'S COMPANY IS THE DEFENSE

THE SOVIET UNION'S ECONOMY CANNOT BE COMPARED TO THE US. AS FAR
AS WE ARE CONCERNED CHINA IS A MUCH MORE BACKWARD COUNTRY. THAT IS

WHY WE SAY YOU ARE A SUPERPOWER.

WANT PEACE. BUT IF THE SOVIET UNION WERE TO IMPOSE

A WAR ON YOU WHAT WOULD YOU DO?


64. ROGERS: I AM CONVINCEDIF THEY START A WAR
THEIR NATION WOULD BE WIPED OUT AND THEY KNOW IT. FOR

THAT MATTER BOTH SIDES WOULD BE IN A NUCLEAR EXCHANGE.

WE HAVE TO DEFEND OURSELVES. OUR STRENGTH IS NOT FOR

72. LI: PERHAPS THERE IS A TREND FOR APPEASEMENT IN THE US.

THERE VIEWPOINT IS JUST THE OPPOSITE.


76. LI: THERE MAY BE SOME WHO STILL HOLD ON TO THE SONNELFELDT

DOCTRINE.


77. ROGERS: YES, BUT THERE ARE ONLY A FEW AND THEIR VIEW DOES
NOT PREVAIL.


78. LI: HOW ABOUT PRM 10? MR. VANCE ALREADY INDICATED TO US THAT
IT ONLY CONTAINED OPTIONS FOR CONSIDERATION. SINCE THERE ARE

SOME PEOPLE WHO DO PUT FORTH SUCH OPTIONS THAT MEANS THAT THE
SONNENFELDT TYPE OF THING HAS NOT DIED.


79. ROGERS: LET ME EXPLAIN THE OPTIONS PROCESS. IT IS PARTLY A

SCHOLARLY APPROACH LISTING ALL POSSIBLE OPTIONS FROM THE VERY
BEST TO THE VERY WORST. IT IS A MENTAL EXERCISE AND DOESN'T

MEAN THAT YOU SUPPORT ANY PARTICULAR OPTION. LET ME SAY SERIOUSLY,
YOUR VIEW OF A SHAM PEACE HAS CAUSED A LOT OF PEOPLE IN THE US

TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT DETENTE. WE WILL TRY TO DEAL WITH OTHERS
PEACEFULLY BUT WE WILL REMAIN MILITARILY STRONG. AND WE

REALIZE WE CANNOT DEPEND ON SOME AGREEMENTS.

3. VICE PREMIER LI WELCOMED MR. AND MRS. ROGERS AND

OTHER MEMBERS OF THE PARTY WARMLY. AFTER SOME INITIAL
COURTESIES, MR. ROGERS SAID THAT ON HIS PREVIOUS VISIT

IN 1972 WITH PRESIDENT NIXON HE HAD MET PREMIER CHOU
EN-LAI BUT HAD NOT HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO MEET CHAIRMAN
MAO TSE-TUNG. DURING THAT VISIT PREMIER CHOU HAD









EXPRESSED A REAL DESIRE TO VISIT NEW YORK AT THE UNITED
NATIONS. HE REGRETTED THAT THAT HAD NOT BEEN POSSIBLE.

HE SAID THAT HE WAS AWARE THAT CHINA HAD SUFFERED GREAT
LOSSES WITH THE DEATH OF PREMIER CHOU AND CHAIRMAN MAO.

BUT HE SENSED THAT THERE HAD BEEN A RECOVERY FROM THESE
LOSSES AND THAT THE GOVERNMENT WAS VERY HEALTHY.


4. LI: OUR GREAT TEACHER AND LEADER MAO TSE-TUNG
PASSED AWAY LAST YEAR AS DID PREMIER CHOU EN-LAI AND

CHU TE BUT WE HAVE RECOVERED. YOU ARE ONE OF THE
PARTICIPANTS OF THOSE WHO HELPED TO IMPROVE RELATIONS

BETWEEN CHINA AND THE UNITED STATES WHILE PRESIDENT
NIXON WAS IN OFFICE. I AM CONVINCED THAT BOTH THE

CHINESE AND AMERICAN PEOPLE WELCOMED SUCH A DEVELOPMENT
AND THE CHINESE PEOPLE WELCOME YOU BACK FOR A VISIT.


5. ROGERS: I AM SURE THAT ALL AMERICANS SUPPORTED THE

NIXON VISIT AND THE SHANGHAI COMMUNIQUE AND THAT THEY
ARE HAPPY THAT RELATIONS HAVE IMPROVED.


6. LI: YES.


7. ROGERS: MANY AMERICANS HAVE VISITED YOUR COUNTRY

AND SOME CHINESE DELEGATIONS HAVE GONE TO THE US.
THE SHANGHAI CMMUNIQUE MENTIONED THE DESIRE FOR AN
IMPROVEMENT IN TRADE. MR. LYET IS ONE OF OUR LEADING

CONFIDENTIAL


CONFIDENTIAL


PAGE 03    PEKING 02221 01 OF 04 301425Z


BUSINESSMEN AND HE IS VERY INTERESTED IN GETTING TO
KNOW YOUR COUNTRY. THIS IS HIS FIRST VISIT.


8. MR. LYET: I AM DELIGHTED TO BE HERE. I AM

INTERESTED NOT ONLY IN TRADE BUT IN THE IMPROVEMENT
OF RELATIONS BETWEEN OUR TWO PEOPLES.


9. LI: WELL WE MUST CONSIDER A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF

TRADE BUT AT THE PRESENT MOMENT TRADE CANNOT BE BUT
LIMITED. SINCE THERE IS NO NORMALIZATION OF RELATIONS,
TRADE WILL SUFFER CERTAIN LIMITS.


10. ROGERS: WE HOPE VERY MUCH TO HAVE THE SHANGHAI

COMMUNIQUE CARRIED OUT AND THAT NORMALIZATION WILL
OCCUR. WE UNDERSTAND THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT'S POSITION.

BUT IN THE MEANTIME TO CARRY OUT THE POLICICIES OF
CHAIRMAN MAO AND YOUR GOVERNMENT'S POLICY OF MODERNIZA-

TION OF AGRICULTURE, THERE IS SOME TRADE WHICH WOULD
BE BENEFICIAL TO BOTH SIDES. THE LAST TIME I WAS HERE

WE TALKED TO SOME OF YOUR OFFICIALS ABOUT THIS
SUBJECT AND SUBSEQUENTLY CHINA BOUGHT 10 BOEING 707'S. I

UNDERSTAND THAT PURCHASE WORKED OUT VERY WELL. DO









YOU LIKE THE 707'S BETTER THAN THE RUSSIAN PLANES?


11. LI: FRANKLY SPEAKING, THE 707'S ARE BETTER THAN
THE RUSSIAN PLANES.


12. MR. LYET: THE 707'S ARE EQUIPPED WITH SOME OF OUR (SPERRY

RAND) HYDRAULIC AND NAVIGATIONAL EQUIPMENT.

13. LI: MAY I KNOW IF THERE ARE ANY PRODUCTS THAT ARE USED IN

THE 707 THAT ARE MANUFACTURED IN WESTERN EUROPE?

16. LI: WELL THE WESTERN PRESS DESCRIBES ME AS AN
EXPERT ON ECONOMIC MATTERS. BUT I AM NOT WORTHY OF

BEING DESCRIBED AS AN EXPERT.

WAS ANOTHER GREAT SOLDIER AS WELL AS A GREAT PRESIDENT.


20. LI: AFTER THE LIBERATION OF OUR COUNTRY CHAIRMAN MAO WANTED
ME TO CONDUCT PARTY WORK IN LOCAL GOVERNMENT. THEN I GRADUALLY

BECAME ENGAGED IN ECONOMIC WORK AND CHANGED MY MILITARY UNIFORM
FOR CIVILIAN GARB. THE SOVIETS CLASSIFY US AS A GROUP OF WARLORDS

AND BUREAUCRATS. I AM CONSIDERED AS BOTH BY THE SOVIET UNION.
BUT ACTUALLY WE HOPE THERE WILL BE PEACE BUT WE DON'T WANT A

SHAM PEACE, WE WANT A GENUINE PEACE. PERHAPS YOUR VIEWS ARE CLEAR

AS A GOOD COMMUNIQUE. ALTHOUGH IT HAS NOT HELPED TO

SOLVE ISSUES TOTALLY AND COMPLETELY, IT CONSITTUTES
THE BASIS FOR THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CHINA AND THE U.S.

EVEN YOUR PRESIDENT JIMMY CARTER MENTIONED THAT THE
SHANGHAI COMMUNIQUE CONSTITUTES THE BASIS OF RELATIONS

BETWEEN CHINA AND THE U.S. THERE IS ANOTHER VERY
IMPORTANT PRINCIPLE IN THE SHANGHAI COMMUNIQUE, THAT IS

BOTH PARTIES WILL NOT SEEK HEGEMONY AND BOTH ARE
OPPOSED TO ANY OTHER PARTY SEEKING HEGEMONY. ANOTHER
VERY IMPORTANT PRINCIPLE IN THE SHANGHAI COMMUNIQUE IS

THAT THE CHINESE ON BOTH SIDES OF THE TAIWAN STRAITS
ACKNOWLEDGE THERE IS BUT ONE CHINA.ON OTHER ISSUES

EACH PARTY EXPOUNDED ITS OWN POINT OF VIEW. AS TO
SPECIFICS THE SHANGHAI COMMUNIQUE ALSO MENTIONED THAT

BOTH PARTIES COULD CONDUCT EXCHANGES OF PEOPLE AND SOME
TRADE. WHEN PRESIDENT NIXON WAS STILL IN OFFICE HIS

WAS A COURAGEOUS STEP. OF COURSE YOU WERE A PARTICIPANT. FORMER
PRESIDENT NIXON CAME TO CHINA AGAIN LAST YEAR. HOW IS HIS

HEALTH?


23. ROGERS: I SAW HIM SIX MONTHS AGO AND PLAYED GOLF









WITH HIM. HE IS IN GOOD HEALTH BUT MRS. NIXON IS NOT
VERY WELL. SHE HAS SUFFERED A STROKE. I WANT TO SAY

HOW MUCH HE APPRECIATED YOUR INVITATION. IT CAME AT
A TIME WHEN IT WAS VERY DIFFICULT FOR HIM.


24. LI: WE DO NOT FORGET OUR OLD FRIENDS. WELL

THERE ARE SOME OLD FRIENDS YOU CAN FORGET. BUT NIXON
HAS DONE SOME GOOD THINGS. AND WE WON'T FOREGET HIM.
PLEASE CONVEY MY REGARDS TO HIM WHEN YOU RETURN.

27. ROGERS. I UNDERSTAND. I AM NOT IN OFFICE AND NOT IN A POSITION
TO NEGOTIATE BUT I KNOW PRESIDENT CARTER STRONGLY
SUPPORTS THE SHANGHAI COMMUNIQUE. HOWEVER HE HAS ONLY

BEEN IN OFFICE FOR EIGHT MONTHS AND HE HAS MANY
PROBLEMS AND THEREFORE MUST MOVE WITH CARE. HE IS

ANXIOUS TO PROCEED IN A MANNER CONSISTENT WITH THE
SHANGHAI COMMUNIQUE. I HAVE NO CONCERN ABOUT THE POLICY OF THE

US IN CARRYING OUT WHAT PRESIDENT NIXON STARTED.


28. LI: WELL I HOPE SO BUT WE WILL HAVE TO WAIT AND SEE.

CHINA HE UNDERSTANDS YOU POSITION. SOME NEWS REPORTS

STATED THAT THERE WAS SOME FLEXIBILITY ON YOUR PART BUT
I THINK THAT SECRETARY VANCE UNDERSTANDS YOUR POSITION

VERY WELL AND DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT IT IS FLEXIBLE.

AREAS. I HOPE YOUR VISIT WILL HELP YOU TO BETTER UNDER-
STAND THE SITUATION IN OUR COUNTRY. LAST YEAR THERE

EMERGED IN OUR PARTY AN ANTI-PARTY CLIQUE. ACTUALLY IT
FIRST EMERGED SOME TIME AGO AND CHAIRMAN MAO CRITIZED

THEM WHEN HE WAS ALIVE. LAST YEAR CHAIRMAN HUA AND THE
CENTRAL COMMITTEE OF THE CHINESE COMMUNIST PARTY SMASHED

THE ANTI-PARTY CLIQUE OF THE GANG OF FOUR. IN THE
COURSE OF YOUR VISIT YOU CAN SEE FOR YOURSELF IF THE

SITUATION IS STABLE WHEN YOU GO OUT OF PEKING. WHEN
YOU GO AND SEE OTHER PARTS OF THE COUNTRY YOU CAN SEE
IF THE COMMON PEOPLE ARE SUPPORTING CHAIRMAN HUA IN

SMASHING THE GANG OF FOUR.


52. ROGERS: WE HAVE HAD SEVERAL TALKS WITH MR. HUA AND
OTHERS AND ARE CONVINCED THAT YOUR PEOPLE FULLY SUPPORT

YOUR NEW LEADERSHIP. THIS IS ALSO KNOWN BY THE AMERICAN
PEOPLE AND IT IS IMPORTANT FOR RELATIONS BETWEEN OUR

TWO COUNTRIES. WE THINK A STRONG, STABLE CHINA IS A
VERY IMPORTANT FACTOR IN WORLD PEACE. THERE IS A

FEELING IN SOME PARTS OF THE WORLD THAT THE US IS NOT
AS STRONG AS IT WAS BUT THIS IS NOT TRUE. OUR MILITARY

STRENGTH IS VERY GREAT. OUR ECONOMY IS STRONG. WE
WILL HAVE A GROWTH RATE THIS YEAR OF BETWEEN 3.5 AND 5 PERCENT.


53. LE: YOU SAID THAT SOME PEOPLE SAY THAT THE U.S.

IS NOT AS STRONG AS IT USED TO BE. FRANKLY SPEAKING,
WE ARE ONE OF THOSE WHO HAVE SUCH A VIEW BUT I DO AGREE
THAT YOUR ECONOMY IS STRONG.


54. ROGERS: I THINK IT IS A SERIOUS ERROR TO THINK THE

US IS NOT STRONG. IF WE HAD AN EMERGENCY OUR PRODUCTIVE
CAPACITY IS SO GREAT WE COULD QUICKLY GEAR UP TO MEET

THE EMERGENCY. MR. LYET'S COMPANY IS THE DEFENSE
DEPARTMENT'S THIRD LARGEST SUPPLIER IN ELECTRONICS.

WE ARE QUITE CONFIDENT THE US IS IN A STRONG POSITION.


LI: IN TERMS OF A COMPARISON BETWEEN THE SOVIET UNION AND THE US,

THE SOVIET UNION'S ECONOMY CANNOT BE COMPARED TO THE US. AS FAR
AS WE ARE CONCERNED CHINA IS A MUCH MORE BACKWARD COUNTRY. THAT IS

WHY WE SAY YOU ARE A SUPERPOWER.

ROGERS: BUT WE DON'T LIKE THE WORD &quot;SUPERPOWER.&quot;


LI: BUT THAT IS THE OBJECTIVE REALITY.


ROGERS: WE ARE TRYING TO DEVELOP GOOD RELATIONS WITH

ALL COUNTRIES AND WE ARE WORKING FOR PEACE SO SOME SAY WE
ARE NOT STRONG.

55. LI: BUT TODAY YOU ARE SLIGHTLY ON THE INITIATIVE
SINCE YOU HAVE PUT DOWN THE BURDEN OF INDOCHINA.


56. ROGERS: ON THE QUESTION OF MILITARY STRENGTH

OUR WEAPONS ARE SO MUCH MORE SOPHISTICATED THAN THE SOVIETS
THAT I HAVE NO FEAR THAT RUSSIA WOULD ATTACK THE US.


57. MR. LYET: AS AN AMERICAN BUSINESSMAN I PARTICIPATED

IN DEFENSE DEPARTMENT BRIEFINGS WHERE ASSESSMENTS
OF THE SOVIET MILITARY'S POSITION AND OURS IS GIVEN.

WE HAVE A DEFINITE SUPERIORITY IN MILITARY WEAPONS.


58. ROGERS: THERE ARE TWO POSSIBLE ASPECTS OF A









FUTURE WAR. FIRST IS WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IMMEDIATELY.
IN THAT ASPECT WE HAVE SUPERIOR WEAPONS. SECOND IS

PRODUCTIVE CAPACITY. THERE IS NO COMPARISON BETWEEN
THE SOVIET UNION AND THE US' PRODUCTIVE CAPACITY ONCE

WE GEAR UP.


59. LI: WELL IN MY VIEW IT IS BETTER FOR YOU NOT TO
STRESS THE SECOND POINT. TODAY IT IS THE SOVIET
UNION THAT SEEKS EXPANSION AND YOU ARE ON THE DEFENSIVE.

WE SAY ALL THIS IN YOUR OWN INTEREST.

60. ROGERS: I KNOW. THAT IS WHY WE HAVE COMMON
INTERESTS. BUT I DON'T THINK THERE IS A LIKELIHOOD

OF THE SOVIET UNION ATTACKING IN OUR LIFETIME AT LEAST.


61. LI: DON'T SAY SO SO DEFINITELY.


62. ROGERS: I HOPE I AM NOT WRONG.

63. LI: I HOPE SO BUT I AM OLDER. I AM STILL

PREPARED TO FIGHT IN A NEW WAR. I HAVE ALWAYS SAID WE
WANT PEACE. BUT IF THE SOVIET UNION WERE TO IMPOSE

A WAR ON YOU WHAT WOULD YOU DO?


64. ROGERS: I AM CONVINCEDIF THEY START A WAR
THEIR NATION WOULD BE WIPED OUT AND THEY KNOW IT. FOR

THAT MATTER BOTH SIDES WOULD BE IN A NUCLEAR EXCHANGE.


65. ROGERS: THE AGGRESSOR ALWAYS HAS THE ADVANTAGE.
WE HAVE TO DEFEND OURSELVES. OUR STRENGTH IS NOT FOR

AGGRESSIVE PURPOSES.


66. LI: IN MY OPINION IT WOULD BE BETTER IF WE HARPED
LESS ON SHAM PEACE. THERE HAS BEEN A LOT OF CLAMOR

ABOUT DIARMAMENT. I DON'T BELIEVE IN THE SHAM DISARMAMENT.

67. ROGERS: WE HAVE MUCH IN COMMON THERE.


68. LI: I DON'T BELIEVE IN DISARMAMENT OR DETENTE.

IMMEDIATELY AFTER HELSINKI THE RUSSIANS POCKETED ANGOLA.


69. ROGERS: I DON'T DISAGREE. WHEN WE DEAL WITH OTHER
NATIONS WE MUST MAKE SURE THAT IT IS NOT A SHAM.

70. LI: WELL WHAT WE SAY IS GENUINE. WE MEAN WHAT WE SAY.


71. ROGERS: IN THE US YOUR VIEWPOINT IS MORE GENERALLY
HEARD PARTLY BECAUSE OF ANGOLA AND BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF

PROGRESS IN SALT THERE IS A FEELING WE MUST BE VERY CAREFUL.

72. LI: PERHAPS THERE IS A TREND FOR APPEASEMENT IN THE US.

I REFER TO THE SONNENFELDT DOCTRINE.


73. ROGERS: SONNENFELDT IS LONG GONE.


74. LI: NOT NECESSARILY. SOME PEOPLE STILL BELIEVE AS HE DID.


75. ROGERS: NOT AS FAR AS THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE NOW CONCERNED.
THERE VIEWPOINT IS JUST THE OPPOSITE.


76. LI: THERE MAY BE SOME WHO STILL HOLD ON TO THE SONNELFELDT

DOCTRINE.


77. ROGERS: YES, BUT THERE ARE ONLY A FEW AND THEIR VIEW DOES
NOT PREVAIL.


78. LI: HOW ABOUT PRM 10? MR. VANCE ALREADY INDICATED TO US THAT
IT ONLY CONTAINED OPTIONS FOR CONSIDERATION. SINCE THERE ARE

SOME PEOPLE WHO DO PUT FORTH SUCH OPTIONS THAT MEANS THAT THE
SONNENFELDT TYPE OF THING HAS NOT DIED.


79. ROGERS: LET ME EXPLAIN THE OPTIONS PROCESS. IT IS PARTLY A

SCHOLARLY APPROACH LISTING ALL POSSIBLE OPTIONS FROM THE VERY
BEST TO THE VERY WORST. IT IS A MENTAL EXERCISE AND DOESN'T

MEAN THAT YOU SUPPORT ANY PARTICULAR OPTION. LET ME SAY SERIOUSLY,
YOUR VIEW OF A SHAM PEACE HAS CAUSED A LOT OF PEOPLE IN THE US

TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT DETENTE. WE WILL TRY TO DEAL WITH OTHERS
PEACEFULLY BUT WE WILL REMAIN MILITARILY STRONG. AND WE

REALIZE WE CANNOT DEPEND ON SOME AGREEMENTS.

80. LI: I HAVE ALREADY TOLD YOUR AMERICAN FRIENDS

WE HOPE RELATIONS BETWEEN THE US AN WESTERN EUROPE WILL BE GOOD
BASED ON EQUAL PARTNERSHIP AND MUTUAL BENEFIT. WE HOPE US-JAPANESE

RELATIONS WILL BE GOOD. BUT WE HAVE TO CRITICIZE A LITTLE
BECAUSE YOU ARE UNWILLING TO LISTEN TO TERMINOLOGY LIKE

&quot;SUPERPOWER&quot;.


81. ROGERS: WE DON'T THINK OF THESE THINGS AS CRITICISM,JUST
TALKS BETWEEN FRIENDS.










82. THE MEETING CONCLUDES WITH LI DECLARING THAT THE

TALKS HAD BEEN CANDID AND VERY FRANK. HE INVITED MR. AND
MRS. ROGERS TO VISIT CHINA AGAIN AT ANY TIME.
