		<h3>Tor</h3>
		<p><a href="https://www.torproject.org">Tor</a> is an encrypted anonymising network that makes it harder to intercept internet communications, or see where communications are coming from or going to.</p>
		<p>In order to use the WikiLeaks public submission system as detailed above you can download the Tor Browser Bundle, which is a Firefox-like browser available for Windows, Mac OS X and GNU/Linux and pre-configured to connect using the anonymising system Tor.</p>
		<h4>Tails</h4>
		<p>If you are at high risk and you have the capacity to do so, you can also access the submission system through a secure operating system called <a href="https://tails.boum.org">Tails</a>. Tails is an operating system launched from a USB stick or a DVD that aim to leaves no traces when the computer is shut down after use and automatically routes your internet traffic through Tor. Tails will require you to have either a USB stick or a DVD at least 4GB big and a laptop or desktop computer.</p>

		<h3>Tips</h3>
		<p>Our submission system works hard to preserve your anonymity, but we recommend you also take some of your own precautions. Please review these basic guidelines. </p>
		<div>
			<h4>1. Contact us if you have specific problems</h4>
			<p>If you have a very large submission, or a submission with a complex format, or are a high-risk source, please <a href="#submit_help_contact">contact us</a>. In our experience it is always possible to find a custom solution for even the most seemingly difficult situations.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h4>2. What computer to use</h4>
			<p>If the computer you are uploading from could subsequently be audited in an investigation, consider using a computer that is not easily tied to you. Technical users can also use <a href="https://tails.boum.org">Tails</a> to help ensure you do not leave any records of your submission on the computer.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h4>3. Do not talk about your submission to others</h4>
			<p>If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in source protection – it is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This includes other media organisations.</p>
		</div>

	</div>
</div>

<div id="submit_help_after" class="submit_elem">

			</div>
		</div>

		<h3>After</h3>

		<div>
			<h4>1. Do not talk about your submission to others</h4>
			<p>If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in source protection – it is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This includes other media organisations.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h4>2. Act normal</h4>
			<p>If you are a high-risk source, avoid saying anything or doing anything after submitting which might promote suspicion. In particular, you should try to stick to your normal routine and behaviour.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h4>3. Remove traces of your submission</h4>
			<p>If you are a high-risk source and the computer you prepared your submission on, or uploaded it from, could subsequently be audited in an investigation, we recommend that you format and dispose of the computer hard drive and any other storage media you used.</p>
			<p>In particular, hard drives retain data after formatting which may be visible to a digital forensics team and flash media (USB sticks, memory cards and SSD drives) retain data even after a secure erasure. If you used flash media to store sensitive data, it is important to destroy the media.</p>
			<p>If you do this and are a high-risk source you should make sure there are no traces of the clean-up, since such traces themselves may draw suspicion.</p>
			<div>
				<h4>4. If you face legal action</h4>
				<p>If a legal action is brought against you as a result of your submission, there are organisations that may help you. The Courage Foundation is an international organisation dedicated to the protection of journalistic sources. You can find more details at <a href="https://www.couragefound.org">https://www.couragefound.org</a>.</p>

		<p>WikiLeaks publishes documents of political or historical importance that are censored or otherwise suppressed. We specialise in strategic global publishing and large archives.</p>
		<p>The following is the address of our secure site where you can anonymously upload your documents to WikiLeaks editors. You can only access this submissions system through Tor. (See our <a href="#submit_help_tor">Tor tab</a> for more information.) We also advise you to read our <a href="#submit_help_tips">tips for sources</a> before submitting.</p>

    India's South China Sea policy?<br />
<br />
<br />
   Hi Deba,<br />
<br />
   How have you been?  I've enjoyed reading your latest articles.  It's been<br />
   far too long since I've paid a visit to Delhi. Hopefully soon enough.<br />
<br />
   I read this article (see below) from one of your possible colleagues,<br />
   Pankaj Jha. Do you know him?  I'm looking for some background information<br />
   on what India is actually thinking in terms of a South China Sea policy.<br />
   If you have thoughts on this, would like to hear it. Would also be very<br />
   interested in speaking with Mr. Pankaj Jha and another experts on this<br />
   issue if you would be so kind to connect me to them. I included one of our<br />
   latest assessments on the South China Sea issue below.<br />
<br />
   Thanks, Deba.  Hope all is well with you and your family.<br />
<br />
   Best,<br />

          Time for India to Articulate its Interest in South China Sea<br />

<br />
   The reported confrontation, in late July, between a Chinese warship and<br />
   the Indian naval amphibious ship Airavat in the South China Sea - also<br />
   known as West Philippines Sea and East Vietnam Sea - shows<br />
   that China wants India-Vietnam liaisons to be toned down, or should be<br />
   conducted in a manner to the liking of the PLN commanders.<br />
<br />
   According to the Financial Times, the unidentified Chinese ship demanded<br />
   that the Indian vessel &quot;identify itself and explain its presence in what<br />
   it said were Chinese waters.&quot;<br />
<br />
   India has maintained a stoic silence about the incident but it is<br />
   perceived that while China has the political will and means to justify its<br />
   presence in the Indian Ocean, India is a diminutive power, not capable of<br />
   expressing its interest in the South China Sea.<br />
<br />
   Over the years, India has been cultivating ties with Vietnam in a more<br />
   realistic fashion without getting undue media attention.<br />
<br />
   On its part, the Indian media has been conveniently myopic on issues<br />
   related to East Asia. Probably that is the main reason India has not seen<br />
   its relations with Vietnam in the same strategic light that China has<br />
   viewed its ties with Pakistan in India's neighborhood.<br />

<br />
   It took a US president to make India understand the relevance of East Asia<br />
   and cajole it to identify the need for a pragmatic stance on important<br />
   issues of regional security and development in the extended neighborhood.<br />
<br />
   Why is Indian foreign ministry so naA-ve in its dealings with China? Why<br />
   can't there be a strong rebuttal to intimation and encroachment of<br />
   international waters by China?<br />
<br />
   While Indian intelligence agencies might be working overtime to sniff out<br />
   the Chinese presence along the Line of Control (LOC) both in the eastern<br />
   and northern sectors, the Ministry of External Affairs does not thinks it<br />
   is a vital issue.<br />
<br />
   In recent memory, the only bright spot in the Indian foreign policy<br />
   articulation in relation to China was when Preneet Kaur, Minister of State<br />
   for External Affairs, stated at the ASEAN Regional Forum in 2010 that the<br />
   South China Sea is an international sea lane of communication, and it<br />
   should be free for navigation. She also emphasized on an amicable solution<br />
   to the South China Sea dispute.<br />
<br />
   Thereafter, during last October's ASEAN Defence Ministers' meeting, the<br />
   Indian defense minister conveniently chose to talk about piracy and<br />
   maritime security, showing little interest in the South China Sea issue.<br />
   Among other issues, the need for a Code of Conduct was discussed by the<br />
   claimant parties to the Spratly Islands at that forum.<br />
<br />
   Significantly, Vietnam also chose not to magnify the issue fearing that<br />
   the inaugural summit, which it hosted, might be jeopardised and it would<br />
   be seen as the spoiler. Vietnamese decision makers are also of the view<br />
   that the United States might conveniently cede territories to China as it<br />
   had done with regard to Paracel Islands, which has been in Chinese control<br />
   since 1974.<br />
<br />
   India has been trying to build relations with Vietnam, Japan, Indonesia<br />
   and Malaysia. The country's level of engagement with Southeast Asian<br />
   nations depends on their defense and political relations vis-a-vis China.<br />
   While the Indian Maritime Military Strategy doctrine lists the South China<br />
   Sea as an area of interest, it falls short on outlining its priorities in<br />
   the region.<br />
<br />
   Vietnam, fortunately, is welcoming Indian participation and defence<br />
   assistance. Though it has the largest standing army in Southeast Asia,<br />
   Vietnam's naval ships are outdated. It is in the process of procuring six<br />
   kilo class submarines, advanced frigates and state-of-the-art Sukhoi-30<br />
   VKM aircraft. Vietnam is looking for Indian assistance in training its<br />
   submariners and future pilots.<br />
<br />
   There have also been talks about surveillance and intelligence cooperation<br />
   between the two nations. There is a possibility of long term training and<br />
   maintenance assistance to Vietnamese military forces.<br />
<br />
   India has, for quite some time, been requesting docking rights in ports<br />
   like Nha Trang and Cam Ranh Bay. The increasing liaison visits by the<br />
   Indian naval ships and the visits by high level delegations from both<br />
   sides have annoyed China. India is working out possibilities of<br />
   cooperation with Vietnam, Japanand Korea; but it has been moving gingerly<br />
   because of China.<br />
<br />
   While the Indian military establishment is highlighting the need for<br />
   defense exercises with countries such as Vietnam and Japan, so as to give<br />
   signals to the Chinese defense establishment, the country's foreign policy<br />
   mandarins seem smitten by the Chinese economic development and prosperity<br />
   to such as extent that, for them, annoying China is a completely<br />
   unthinkable proposition.<br />
<br />
   Increasing liaison, both in military and diplomatic terms, would mean that<br />
   India would be poised to play a more active role than a fancied fence<br />
   watcher. And it would also require more work and better policy<br />
   articulation.<br />
<br />
   With strong defence cooperation with Vietnam, India can counter Chinese<br />
   nuclear submarines and ballistic missile capabilities. Greater security<br />
   understanding would also mean that China would have to think twice before<br />
   embarking on any military intimidation or diplomatic demarche.<br />
<br />
   But so far, India has been a reluctant player. When China issued a<br />
   diplomatic demarche in 2007 about India's oil and gas exploration projects<br />
   near the southern Vietnamese coast, India conveniently chose to overlook<br />
   and pressed the mute button.<br />
<br />
   Chinese infrastructure projects in the Pakistan-occupied Kashmir and the<br />
   feeble response by India shows that New Delhi, though it is concerned, is<br />
   not serious about articulating its national interests. The time has come<br />
   for India to speak louder in international forums rather than routinely<br />
   dishing out diplomatic banalities.<br />

            South China Sea Deal Fails To Address Underlying Issues<br />
<br />
   Created Jul 22 2011 - 07:02<br />
<br />
Summary<br />
<br />
   Officials from China and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations agreed<br />
   July 20 on a set of guidelines for handling the South China Sea dispute.<br />
   The guidelines aim to temporarily ease tensions in the disputed region in<br />
   light of several recent incidents, but they do not touch the central<br />
   issues such as energy exploration and military development. Despite the<br />
   U.S. re-engagement in East Asia, Chinese military threats and the<br />
   potential for a brief skirmish over the waters, particularly with Vietnam,<br />
   cannot be ruled out.<br />
<br />
Analysis<br />
<br />
   Senior officials from China and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations<br />
   (ASEAN) held a meeting July 20 in Bali, Indonesia, during which they<br />
   agreed on a set of guidelines in the South China Sea dispute. According to<br />
   an official statement, the guidelines could eventually lead to a binding<br />
   code of conduct, based on an informal agreement reached between China and<br />
   ASEAN countries in 2002, for handling disputes in the South China Sea.<br />
<br />
   The meeting followed a series of incidents in recent months between China,<br />
   Vietnam and the Philippines over the disputed sea. These incidents put the<br />
   issue at the center of the ASEAN meetings in Indonesia, which will span<br />
   July 15-23 and include the 44th ASEAN Ministerial Meeting, Post<br />
   Ministerial Conferences and the 18th ASEAN Regional Forum. Though the<br />
   guidelines are intended to offer a platform, at least temporarily, for<br />
   easing tensions between claimant countries in the South China Sea, they<br />
   fail to address the most critical issues a** energy exploration and<br />
   military-security tensions in the potentially resource-rich waters.<br />
<br />
  Beijinga**s South China Sea Policy<br />
<br />
   Chinaa**s interest in the South China Sea goes beyond nationalistic<br />
   concerns. Chinaa**s expanding dependency on foreign oil poses a threat to<br />
   its energy security and has led Beijing to step up offshore exploration.<br />
   According to Chinese estimates, which could not be verified, the disputed<br />
   waters in the South China Sea contain more than 50 billion tons of crude<br />
   oil and more than 20 trillion cubic meters of natural gas. Additionally,<br />
   China hopes to create a buffer to make it more difficult for foreign<br />
   powers, particularly the United States, to approach Chinese shores.<br />
<br />
   China has long been reluctant to enter into a binding agreement on the<br />
   South China Sea issue. Instead, it has pursued only bilateral dialogues<br />
   and joint exploration proposals with claimant countries a** an approach<br />
   that remains at the center of the disagreement. China continues to lay<br />
   claim to the whole of the South China Sea, and any international<br />
   arbitration or multilateral resolution will necessarily mean China will<br />
   lose some of this territory. Therefore, rather than focus on a solution,<br />
   Beijing seeks to manage each dispute on a bilateral basis while at the<br />
   same time slowly increasing its own physical presence on various reefs and<br />
   conducting more frequent maritime patrols.<br />
<br />
   This long-standing policy was first put forth during the era of Deng<br />
   Xiaoping, with the idea to set aside territorial disputes in favor of<br />
   pursuing joint energy development. The strategy was first applied in the<br />
   territorial disputes with Japan over the East China Sea, when China in<br />
   1979 formally proposed the concept of joint development of resources<br />
   adjacent to the Diaoyu/Senkaku Islands. When China entered into diplomatic<br />
   relations with Southeast Asian countries around the 1980s, it made similar<br />
   proposals with regard to disputes over the Spratly Islands. However, the<br />
   strategy hinges on Chinaa**s belief that the territories concerned belong<br />
   to China. From the Chinese perspective, by setting aside territorial<br />
   disputes, Beijing essentially is allowing parties to engage in exploration<br />
   activities in the potentially energy-rich areas while simultaneously<br />
   solidifying its presence and thus strengthening territorial claims in the<br />
   eyes of the international community. The joint exploration approach also<br />
   offers an opportunity for China to keep claimant countries divided by<br />
   exploiting their individual economic interests. By making bilateral or<br />
   trilateral exploration deals with claimants, each deal may run counter to<br />
   the interests of other claimants, giving China the upper hand.<br />
<br />
   This focus on energy development is one reason the South China Sea<br />
   sovereignty dispute is unlikely to be addressed anytime soon. In 2002 when<br />
   the code of conduct was signed, the claimant countries were competing to<br />
   occupy the islands. The latest tensions, however, largely centered on<br />
   competition for the seaa**s energy and resource potential. Vietnam has<br />
   been relying on oil and fishing revenues in the South China Sea for more<br />
   than 30 percent of its gross domestic product (GDP), and the Philippines<br />
   also sees the potential for energy and resources in the area to satisfy<br />
   its domestic energy needs. As these countries and China become more<br />
   ambitious with their exploration efforts, Beijing sees opportunities to<br />
   extend its joint exploration approach.<br />
<br />
  The Military Option<br />
<br />
   China has other means of complicating unilateral exploration by other<br />
   claimants in the South China Sea. So far there has been no exploration in<br />
   the disputed areas of the South China Sea, and with the latest incidents<br />
   this year China made clear that any future exploration without Chinese<br />
   involvement would result in harassment or other punishment.<br />
<br />
   STRATFOR sources have said that while it is focusing on public calls for<br />
   cooperation, China is leaking that it may still retain the option to use<br />
   military threats or even brief military action to demonstrate how<br />
   seriously it takes its sovereignty claim. Beijing is serious about keeping<br />
   other claimants off balance and blocking any unilateral resource<br />
   development or expansion of another countrya**s military activities in the<br />
   South China Sea.<br />
<br />
   Among the countries with the staunchest territorial claims, China sees<br />
   Vietnam as a more immediate concern than the Philippines, which is allied<br />
   with United States. Vietnam not only is geographically closer to China and<br />
   has the largest overlapping territorial claim but also has existing<br />
   occupations and exploration activities in the South China Sea.<br />
   Furthermore, Vietnama**s national strategy is to strengthen its naval<br />
   capabilities a** and it is investing in the tools to do so a** in order to<br />
   better protect its own efforts to use development in the disputed sea to<br />
   account for half of the countrya**s GDP. The lack of a clear U.S.<br />
   commitment to Vietnam may also encourage China to go beyond the diplomatic<br />
   approach in addressing disputes with the country. The Chinese and<br />
   Vietnamese have engaged in short skirmishes over disputed maritime<br />
   territory in the past, and Beijing sees the potential for threatening or<br />
   even participating in another brief clash as a way to reinforce its<br />
   claims.<br />
<br />
   Meanwhile, the United States has announced its re-engagement in East Asia.<br />
   In response, claimant countries are seeking U.S. backing to strengthen<br />
   their territorial claims and calling for increased U.S. involvement in the<br />
   matter. China likely is calculating, however, that the United States would<br />
   not get involved in brief military conflicts over the South China Sea.<br />
   Beijing saw clearly the impact on perceptions of U.S. reliability in Asia<br />
   when Washington, due to Chinese objections, delayed sending an aircraft<br />
   carrier to the Yellow Sea following North Korean provocations. Therefore,<br />
   a brief skirmish could undermine faith in the U.S. commitment to Southeast<br />
   Asia when it comes to territorial disputes in the South China Sea.<br />
