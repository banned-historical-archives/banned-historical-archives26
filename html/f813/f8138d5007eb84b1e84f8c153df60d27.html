		<h3>Tor</h3>
		<p><a href="https://www.torproject.org">Tor</a> is an encrypted anonymising network that makes it harder to intercept internet communications, or see where communications are coming from or going to.</p>
		<p>In order to use the WikiLeaks public submission system as detailed above you can download the Tor Browser Bundle, which is a Firefox-like browser available for Windows, Mac OS X and GNU/Linux and pre-configured to connect using the anonymising system Tor.</p>
		<h4>Tails</h4>
		<p>If you are at high risk and you have the capacity to do so, you can also access the submission system through a secure operating system called <a href="https://tails.boum.org">Tails</a>. Tails is an operating system launched from a USB stick or a DVD that aim to leaves no traces when the computer is shut down after use and automatically routes your internet traffic through Tor. Tails will require you to have either a USB stick or a DVD at least 4GB big and a laptop or desktop computer.</p>

		<h3>Tips</h3>
		<p>Our submission system works hard to preserve your anonymity, but we recommend you also take some of your own precautions. Please review these basic guidelines. </p>
		<div>
			<h4>1. Contact us if you have specific problems</h4>
			<p>If you have a very large submission, or a submission with a complex format, or are a high-risk source, please <a href="#submit_help_contact">contact us</a>. In our experience it is always possible to find a custom solution for even the most seemingly difficult situations.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h4>2. What computer to use</h4>
			<p>If the computer you are uploading from could subsequently be audited in an investigation, consider using a computer that is not easily tied to you. Technical users can also use <a href="https://tails.boum.org">Tails</a> to help ensure you do not leave any records of your submission on the computer.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h4>3. Do not talk about your submission to others</h4>
			<p>If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in source protection – it is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This includes other media organisations.</p>
		</div>

	</div>

		<h3>After</h3>

		<div>
			<h4>1. Do not talk about your submission to others</h4>
			<p>If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in source protection – it is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This includes other media organisations.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h4>2. Act normal</h4>
			<p>If you are a high-risk source, avoid saying anything or doing anything after submitting which might promote suspicion. In particular, you should try to stick to your normal routine and behaviour.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h4>3. Remove traces of your submission</h4>
			<p>If you are a high-risk source and the computer you prepared your submission on, or uploaded it from, could subsequently be audited in an investigation, we recommend that you format and dispose of the computer hard drive and any other storage media you used.</p>
			<p>In particular, hard drives retain data after formatting which may be visible to a digital forensics team and flash media (USB sticks, memory cards and SSD drives) retain data even after a secure erasure. If you used flash media to store sensitive data, it is important to destroy the media.</p>
			<p>If you do this and are a high-risk source you should make sure there are no traces of the clean-up, since such traces themselves may draw suspicion.</p>
			<div>
				<h4>4. If you face legal action</h4>
				<p>If a legal action is brought against you as a result of your submission, there are organisations that may help you. The Courage Foundation is an international organisation dedicated to the protection of journalistic sources. You can find more details at <a href="https://www.couragefound.org">https://www.couragefound.org</a>.</p>

		<p>WikiLeaks publishes documents of political or historical importance that are censored or otherwise suppressed. We specialise in strategic global publishing and large archives.</p>
		<p>The following is the address of our secure site where you can anonymously upload your documents to WikiLeaks editors. You can only access this submissions system through Tor. (See our <a href="#submit_help_tor">Tor tab</a> for more information.) We also advise you to read our <a href="#submit_help_tips">tips for sources</a> before submitting.</p>

			<!--<div>
				Copy this address into your Tor browser. Advanced users, if they wish, can also add a further layer of encryption to their submission using <a href="#submit_wlkey">our public PGP key</a>.
			</div>-->
		</div>

		<p>If you cannot use Tor, or your submission is very large, or you have specific requirements, WikiLeaks provides several alternative methods. <a href="#submit_help_contact">Contact us</a> to discuss how to proceed.</p>

TENG: YOUR FAMILY IS WELL KOWN IN THE UNITED STATES.

TENG: IT IS HIGHLY IMPORTANT FOR YOU TO SEE CHINA FOR YOURSELF.
WHAT AFTER ALL IS CHINA LIKE?
KENNEDY: WE SEE THAT CHINA IS A DEVELOPING COUNTRY.
OTHER PEOPLE SEE THAT CHINA IS A BIG POWER.
TENG: CHINA IS INDEED BIG IN TERMS OF ITS SIZE AND
ITS POPULATION. BUT IN OTHER SENSES CHINA IS A SMALL
COUTRY. ONE DIFFERENCE EXISTS BETWEEN OLD CHINA AND

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
NEW CHINA. IN THE OLDDAYS WE WERE NOT ABLE TO FEED
OURSELVES. NOW WE HAVE ENOUGH TO EAT AND TO WEAR.
AS FAR AS CONDITIONS OF THE COUNTRY ARE
CONCERNED, WE WANT A MORE PEACEFUL ENVIRONMENT.
WHEN YOU HAVE UNDERSTOOD OUR CONDITIONS IT WILL BE
EASIER FOR YOU TO UNDERSTAND OUR POLITICAL ATTITUDES.
THAT IS WHY I THINK IT IS MOST IMPORTANT FOR YOU
TO COME TO CHINA YOURSELF. YOU ARE AN INFLUENTIAL
FIGURE AND I WANT TO EXPRESS A WARM WELCOME TO YOU.
KENNEDY: MR. VICE PREMIER, FIRST OF ALL I MUST
TELL YOU THAT WE WANT YOU TO KNOW HOW HOSPITABLE THE
CHINESE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN THESE PAST DAYS AND TO EXPRESS OUR APPRECIATION TO OUR HOSTS. AMBASSADOR HAO
AND THE GROUP FROM THE CHINESE PEOPLE'S INSTITUTE
FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS HAVE EXTENDED EVERY ASSISTANCE,
GOOD WILL AND PATIENCE. OUR TRAVELING COMPANIONS
HAVE BEEN ESPECIALLY KIND AND WARM TO ALL OF US.
WE APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SEE SOME FEATURES
OF LIFE OF CHINA WHICH HAVE BEEN EXTREMELY IMPORTANT
TO ME.
IN OUR FEW DAYS IN PEKING, WE HAVE HAD AN OPPORTUNITY
TO TALK TO AMBASSADOR HAO, THE FOREIGN MINISTER, AND
THE FOREIGN TRADE MINISTER REGARDING THE FUTURE OF
OUR PEOPLES. I AM MINDFUL OF THE STRONG HISTORICAL
TIES BETWEEN CHINA AND THE US. I AM MINDFUL OF THE
CONFIDENTIAL

PAGE 03

PEKING 00044 01 OF 04 052238Z

EXTREME IMPORTANCE OF THE STRATEGIC QUESTION OF
SOVIET HEGEMONY. I CAME HERE IN THE BELIEF THAT THE
DESTINIES OF THE TWO PEOPLES ARE CLOSELY INTERTWINED AND I AM CONSCIOUS OF THE INTERRRUPTION OF
TWO DECADES OF A STRONG AND VITAL RELATIONSHIP.
I AM SURE THAT THE VICE PREMIER UNDERSTANDS MY STRONG
COMMITMENT TO NORMALIZATION OF RELATIONS ALONG THE
LINES OF THE SHANGHAI COMMUNIQUE. I RESPECT THE
PRINCIPLES STATED BY TH CHINESE GOVERNMENT ON THE
ISSUE OF TAIWAN, WHICH IS THE PRINCIPAL OBSTACLE TO
NORMALIZATION OF RELATIONS BETWEEN OUR TWO COUNTRIES.
I AM OPPOSED TO A TWO CHINA POLICY OR TO A ONE
CHINA ONE TAIWAN POLICY OR ANY OTHER SIMILAR
POLICIES. THE US MUST OBVIOUSLY MEET ITS REPSONSIBILITIES IN RESPECTING THE THREE PRINCIPLES WHICH ARE
CHINESE POLICY ON TAIWAN. MY OWN HOPE IS THAT IT
(I.E., NORMALIZATION OF RELATIONS) WILL BE SOONER
RATHER THAN LATER. THIS IS THE THOUGHT THAT YOUR
FOREIGN MINISTER AND AMBASSADOR HAO DELIVERED FOR ME
EARLIER.I AM SURE THAT VICE PREMIER TENG IS AWARE
THAT THE PROCESS CAN BE MADE MUCH MORE QUICK, RAPID
AND EXPEDITIOUS. IT CAN BE A LONGER OR MORE COMPLI-

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
CATED PROCESS IN THE US DEPENDING ON THE ATTITUDE
OF THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT AND THE CHINESE PEOPLE.
I AM PREPARED TO WORK FOR THAT PROCESS (I.E.,, A
SHORTER PROCESS)IN THE US SENATE. MY QUESTION TO
THE VICE PREMIER IS WHETHER HE BELIEVES THE ACTIONS
OF THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT WILL BE TO MAKE THAT PROCESS MORE ACTIVE AND RAPID OR TO THE CONTRARY.
I BELIEVE SOME OF THE STEPS WHICH CAN MOVE THE PROCESS
MORE PARIDLY WOULD BE AVAILABILITY OF TECHNOLOGY,
PARTICULARLY IN THE AREA OF PETROLEUM TECHNOLOGY,
BECAUSE OF ITS SUPERIORITY IN THE VIEW OF THE
CHINESE GOVERNMENT. THERE IS GREAT INTEREST IN THE
US TO WORK WITH THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT TO SEE THE
SALE OF TECHNOLOGY WITH ALL INTERNATIONAL MACHINERY

AVAILABLE. I THINK YOU WILL SEE A FURTHER DRAWING
DOWN OF US FORCES ON TAIWAN. WHAT HAS NOT BEEN LOST
AMONG THE PEOPLE OF MY STATE WAS THAT YOUR GOVERNMENT ALLOWED ME TO VISIT WITH THEIR RELATIVES IN
SHANGHAI AND TO EXPLORE THE POSSIBILITY OF A VISIT
OF THE FAMILY FOR HUMANIATARIAN REASONS. THESE ARE
ALL VERY CONSTRUCTIVE AND POSITIVE SIGNALS THAT ARE
RECEIVED IN THE US AT THE PRESENT TIME, AND THEY HELP
MOVE THE PROCESS FORWARD FROM OUR POINT OF VIEW.
AND WE RECOGNIZE OUR RESPONSIBILITY IN THE US
AND IN THE SENATE OF THE US TO MOVE THIS PROCESS FORWARD.
SO THESE TYPES OF THINGS WILL HELP MOVE THE
PROCESS FORWARD MORE RAPIDLY. I WOULD BE INTERESTED
IN THE VIEWS OF THE VICE PREMIER ON WHETHER
THRE WILL BE A DIFFICULT TIME OR PERHAPS A TIME OF
UNDERSTANDING OF POLITICAL REALITIES THAT EXIST IN
US-PRC RELATIONS AT THIS TIME.
TENG:ACTUALLY THE PROBLEM EXISTING BETWEEN CHINA
AND THE US IS TWOFOLD. AS FAR AS OUR BILATERAL RELATIONS ARE CONCERNED THE CRUCIAL PROBLEM FOR NORMALIZATION OF RELATIONS IS THE QUESTION OF TAIWAN. THIS
IS MOST IMPORTANT. WE HAVE ALWAYS SAID THAT IN RELATIONS IN CHINA AND THE US THRE ARE ALSO VIEWS ON
INTERNATIONAL POLICY ISSUES. IN 1972 THEN PRESIDENT
NIXON AND SECRETARY KISSINGER CAME TO CHINA AND
BOTH SIDES ISSUED THE SHANGHAI COMMUNIQUE. AND THEN
OUR TWO COUNTRIES HAVE FOUND A GREATER NUMBER OF
POINTS OF SIMILAR OPINION ON INTERNATIONAL ISSUES
AND WE HAVE SO STATED ON A NUMBER OF OCCASIONS.
SPECIFICALLY THERE IS THE QUESTION OF HOW TO DEAL
WITH THE POLAR BEAR. THAT IS, WITH THE EXPANSIONSISM
OF THE POLAR BEAR AS YOU HAVE SAID RIGHT NOW. THERE

HOPE WE CAN PUSH FORWARD THE PROCESS OF NORMALIZATION AS FAST AS POSSIBLE. OF COURSE WE HOPE THE
PROBLEM CAN BE RESOLVED AT ONCE. THAT WOULD MAKE
OUR TWO PEOPLES VERY HAPPY. WE APPRECIATE VERY
MUCH THE STATEMENT BY SEANTOR KENNEDY THAT YOU ARE
OPPOSED TO THE POLICY OF TWO CHINAS OR ONE CHINA ONE
TAIWAN. BUT THERE IS ONE THING THAT I CANNOT AGREE
WITH. NAMELY, THAT NORMALIZATION OF RELATIONS
DEPENDS ON THE ACTIONS OF THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT
AND THE CHINESE PEOPLE. THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT
MADE UP ITS MIND LONG AGO.
KENNEDY: I UNDERSTAND THAT THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR
ACTION IS THAT OF THE US. I UNDERSTAND THAT THE
CHINESE GOVERNMENT HAS ITS POSITION AND STICKS TO ITS
PRINCIPLED POSITION. AS WE CONSIDER THE PROCESS OF
NORMALIZATION IN SOME OF THE VICE PREMIER' STATEMENTS AND IN COMMENTS BY OTHER CHINESE LEADERS, THESE
WILL HAVE AN IMPORTANT IMPACT ON THE CONTENT AND

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
THE US SENATE AND TO SAY THAT I WAS COMPLETELY CONVINCED THAT PEOPLE IN TAIWAN WOULD BE ABLE TO LIVE
IN PEACE AND PROSPERITY, THAT WOULD HAVE AN IMPACT
ON AMERICAN OPINION.
TENG: THIS IS AN OLD QUESTION. WE HAVE STATED
THE THREE CONDITION FOR NORMALIZATION OF RELATIONS,
NAMELY: (1) SEVERANCE OF DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS WITH
TAIWAN; (2) ABROGATION OF THE MUTUAL DEFENSE TREATY
WITH TAIWAN; AND (3) WITHDRAWAL OF US TROOPS FROM
TAIWAN. IT IS NOT ENOUGH THAT THE US IS DRAWING DOWN ITS
TROOPS AND REDUCING THEM TO A SYMBOLIC PRESENCE.
AS FOR THE MUTUAL DEFENSE TREATY,WOULD THAT MAKE A
DIFFERNCE? SO IN FACT, IT IS SEVERANCE OF DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS WHICH IS CRUCIAL.
AS FORSEVERANCE OF DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS, CHINA HAS
STATED THAT IT WILL AGREE TO THE JAPANESE FORMULA.
WHAT DOES THIS MEAN? YOU SHOULD BREAK OFF DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS WITH TAIWAN. YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE
ANY CONTACT BETWEEN GOVERNMENTS BUT YOU CAN HAVE
NON-GOVERNMENTAL EXCHANGES AND TRADE. WHEN MR.
VANCE VISITED CHINA LAST YEAR WE DISCUSSED THIS
QUESTION AND HE SAID HE AGREED WITH THE THREE CONDITIONS AND WOULD UPHOLD THE SHANGHAI COMMUNIQUE. BUT
HE PROPOSED A US GOVERNMENT AGENCY ON TAIWAN BY
WHATEVER NAME. SO THIS IS THE KEY QUESTION. ONE
OTHER POINT HE RAISED WHAT THAT THE US GOVERNMENT
COULD AGREE TO THE THREE CONDITIONS WHILE NOT ESTABISHING A GOVERNMENT AGENCY ON TAIWAN BUT THE CHINESE
GOVERNMENT SHOULD COMMIT ITSELF NOT TO SOLVE THE TAIWAN
ISSUE BY FORCE. WE MADE VERY CLEAR OUR POSITION

AND ATTITUDE ON THIS ISSUE IN THE PAST. WE STATED
THE SAME POSITION TO PRESIDENT NIXON AND SECRETARY
KISSINGER, TO PRESIDENT FORD AND SECRETARY KISSINGER,
AND TO MR. VANCE. THE QUESTION OF TAIWAN INVOLVES
SOVEREIGNTY. THERE ARE NO TERMS FOR NEGOTIATIONS
ON MATTERS OF SOVEREIGNTY. IN THIS REGARD WE DO
NOT AGREE TO THE STATEMENT OF SOME FRIENDS THAT
CHINA HAS SHOWN FLEXIBILITY ON THIS ISSUE. THERE
IS NO FLEXIBILITY WHATSOEVER. SOVEREIGNTY IS VERY
SERIOUS. THERE IS NO ROOM FOR FLEXIBILTY. IF
FLEXIBILITY IS TO BE SPECIFIED, THERE IS THE JAPANESE
FORMULA. THE OTHER FLEXIBILITY IS THAT IF THE US
NEEDS TAIWAN NOW, WE CAN WAIT. SOME HAVE BEEN VERY
FRANK IN THIS MATTER. AS FOR THE COMMITMENT NOT TO
SETTLE THE TAIWAN PROBLEM BY FORCE, THAT CHINA IS
ASKED TO UNDERTAKE, WE SAY AS TO HOW AND WHEN WE
LIBERATE TAIWAN, IT IS CHINA'S INTERNAL AFFAIR. IN

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
MY TALK WITH JOURNALISTS FROM THE ASSOCIATED PRESS,
I TOLD THEM THAT CHINA COULD NOT POSSIBLY UNDERTAKE
A COMMITMENT ON THE INTERNAL AFFAIRS OF THE CHINESE
PEOPLE. BUT I TOLD THEM THAT CHINA WOULD TAKE NOTE
OF PARTICULAR CONDITIONS IN TAIWAN IN SETTLING THIS
ISSUE. THE PROPOSAL BROUGHT TO CHINA BY MR. VANCE
LAST AUGUST CANNOT WORK. WE ARE MERELY RESTATING
OUR POSITION AND MAKING IT CLEAR TO YOU.AS TO
WHEN THE US MAKES UP ITS MIND, IT IS EASY TO SETTLE
THIS QUESTION. WE CAN WAIT IF THE US NEEDS SOME
MORE TIME.
KENNEDY: I RESPECT AND I UNDERSTAND YOUR POSITION.
THERE ARE POLITICAL PERCEPTIONS IN THE US AS TO MOVING
THE PROCESS OF NORMALIZATION FORWARD AND THERE ARE
PROBLEMS FOR THE POLITICAL LEADERSHIP IN THE US.
AS A BRAVE AND EFFECTIVE FORMER SOLDIER, THE VICE
PREMIER UNDERSTANDS THE FORCES AT WORK ON THE CHINA

JAPANESE SO THAT THE 8TH ROUTE ARMY AND THE 4TH ROUTE
ARMY COULD MOBILIZE 30,000 TROOPS.
KENNEDY: THAT IS WHY I SAID IT IS A PERCEPTION, NOT
A FACT OR A REALITY.
TENG: THESE 30,000 TROOPS SLIPPED INTO THE AREA
CONTROLLED BY CHIANG AND THEY WAGED GUERRILLA WARFARE.
AFTER 8 YEARS OF RESISTANCE TO JAPAN, THESE
30,000 TROOPS TURNED INTO 1,200,000 REGULAR TROOPS.
IN ADDITION TO THAT THERE WERE LARGE NUMBERS OF
REGULAR MILITIA. THE CHINESE PEOPLE KNOW BEST THE ATTITUDE
OF CHIANG TOWARD JAPANESE AGGRESSION. FOREIGNERS
DO NOT UNDERSTAND AFFAIRS IN CHINA. AT THE END OF
WORLD WAR II WHEN THE KMT AND CHINESE COMMUNIST PARTY
NEGOTIATED FOR PEACE, CHIANG ATTACKED OUR BASES WITH
HIS SENIOR MILITARY ADVISORS, THE FORMER COMMANDERIN-CHIEF OF THE JAPANESE TROOPS STATIONED IN NORTH CHINA.
KENNEDY: MANY TIMES PERCEPTIONS ARE DIFFERENT FROM
FACTS. I RESPECT THE FACTS AS YOU HAVE STATED THEM.
IT IS VERY IMPORTANT TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WHO FOUGHT
AGAINST JAPAN. SOME OF THE PEOPLE NOW ON TAIWAN
FOUGHT AGAINST JAPAN. PERCEPTIONS OF CHANGE ON

THE STATUS OF TAIWAN WILL HAVE REPERCUSSIONS WHICH MAY WELL
BE REFLECTED TO THE ADVANTAGE OF THE POLAR BEAR.
TENG: THE RESULT WOULD BE JUST TO THE CONTRARY. IF
THE USG MAKES UP ITS MIND TO NORMALIZE RELATIONS AND
TO RESOLVE THE TAIWAN ISSUE ON THE BASIS OF THE THREE
PRINCIPLES, THIS WOULD HAVE GOOD RESULTS FOR THE US
THROUGHOUT THE WORLD AND WOULD HELP YOUR EFFORTS TO
DEAL WITH THE POLAR BEAR. THE SOVIET SOCIALIST
IMPERIALISTS FEAR MOST THE NORMALIZATION OF RELATIONS
BETWEEN OUR TWO COUNTRIES. THERE ARE SOME WHO RAISE
THE ISSUE THAT IF THE US WITHDRAWS ITS TROOPS FROM
TAIWAN, AND HAS NO TIES WITH TAIWAN EXCEPT NONGOVERNMENTAL TIES, THE SOVIET UNION WILL FILL IN THE
VACUUM. I SIMPLY DON'T BELIEVE SUCH ISSUES, AND I
BELIEVE SUCH ISSUES ARE UNCALLED FOR. WE HAVE INTERESTS
IN TAIWAN TOO, SO THERE IS NO NEED FOR SUCH
ISSUES. SO THE QUESTION NOW INVOLVES WHETHER THE

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
US NEEDS TAIWAN NOW. IF IT NEEDS TAIWAN NOW, I
WILL REITERATE THAT WE WILL BE PATIENT. IN THE END
THE CHINESE PEOPLE WILL RESOLVE THE ISSUE OF TAIWAN.
PEOPLE OF MY AGE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO SEE THE GOAL FULFILLED BUT PEOPLE AT THE AGE OF CHAIRMAN HUA KUOFENG WILL BE ABLE TO SEE THAT. I WISH TO STATE
AGAIN THAT THE QUESTION OF TAIWAN IS BUT ONE QUESTION
IN THE NORMALIZATION OF RELATIONS. WE ARE BOTH
CONFRONTED WITH INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ISSUES TOO.
BEFORE NORMALIZATION OCCURS, WE STILL HAVE POINTS OF
AGREEMENT ON OTHER ISSUES. WE CAN CONTINUE OUR
DISCUSSIONS. APART FROM FOREIGN POLICY DISCUSSIONS, WE
ALSO HAVE EXCHANGES GOING ON BETWEEN OUR TWO SIDES.
BEFORE NORMALIZATION THESE EXCHANGES WILL BE IMPEDED
NOT ONLY FROM CHINA BUT ALSO FROM THE USG. ON THE
PART OF CHINA, WE HOLD THAT THE NON-GOVERNMENTAL
CONFIDENTIAL

PAGE 03

PEKING 00044 03 OF 04 052240Z

EXCHANGES BETWEEN CHINA AND THE US SHOULD NOT EXCEED
THOSE BETWEEN CHINA AND OTHER COUNTRIES WHICH HAVE
DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS WITH US. AS TO THE US GOVERNMENT
POSITION, IF THERE IS SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
THAT WE NEED YOU WILL NOT GIVE THIS TO US.
KENNEDY: THERE ARE SOME PARTICULAR AREAS, COMPUTERS
AND OTHERS, WHICH HAVE BEEN RESOLVED. I BELIEVE THAT
YOU WILL FIND THAT THERE WILL BE LESS RESTRICTIONS
ON PURCHASES BY CHINA. CERTAINLY IN THE US SENATE
I WILL STRONGLY URGE THE ADMINISTRATION TO EXERT
PRESSURE ON BEHALF OF REDUCING RESTRICTIONS ON SALES
TO YOU.
TENG: THE COMPUTERS YOU MENTIONED ARE ONE CASE IN
POINT. WHEN WE DISCUSSED THIS QUESTION WITH DR.
KISSINGER HE PROPOSED THAT THE US GOVERNMENT WOULD
INTERVENE AND WOULD HELP NEGOTIATIONS ON THIS POINT.
HOW IS THIS POSSIBLE IF OUR TWO GOVERNMENTS HAVE NOT
NORMALIZED RELATIONS? ONE OTHER EXAMPLE. WE ARE
TRYING TO BUY SEOMTHING FROM CERTAIN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES
BUT PART OF THE TECHNOLOGY INVOLVED COMES FROM THE
US. THE US WOULD NOT AGREE TO SALE OF IT. YOU HAVE
SHARES IN LOTS OF MULTI-NATIONAL CORPORATIONS IN
EUROPE (LAUGHTER). SO IN THE FINAL ANALYSIS THE
QUESTION OF NORMALIZATION OF RELATIONS BETWEEN OUR
TWO COUNTRIES CAN BE SETTLED ONLY IF YOU APPROACH
THIS QUESTION FROM THE POLICY POINT OF VIEW. WE
MUST ALSO LOOK AT THIS QUESTION FROM A LONG TERM
STRATEGY POINT OF VIEW. IF YOU DO THAT, THINGS WILL
DEVELOP ALONG THE DESIRED COURSE. TECHNOLOGY,
CULTURAL EXCHANGES, ECONOMIC AGREEMENTS AND SO FORTH
WILL FOLLOW FROM IT.

SUPPLY OF FOOD GRAINS, SUPPORT OF TECHNOLOGY SALES
TO THE SOVIET UNION YOU WILL BE ABLE TO CURB SOVIET

YOU VISITED THE SOVIET UNION?

SEVEN TIMES. I KNOW MANY SOVIET LEADERS.

AMBASSADOR HAO, FOREIGN MINISTER HUANG AND VICE

STRENGTH AND IS PREPARED TO USE IT. THIS HAS NO RELEVANCE TO THE CHAMBERLAIN POLICY OF WORLD WAR II. THE

SONNELFELDT DOCTRINE IS INTERESTING FOR ONE WHO
FOLLOWED WEST EUROPEAN AFFAIRS AS VICE CHAIRMAN OF
THE NATO DEFENSE COMMITTEE FOR FOUR YEARS. THE
SONNENFELDT DOCTRINE IS A TERM BASICALLY TAKEN OUT
OF CONTEXT. THE SONNENFELDT DOCTRINE IS ENTIRELY
IN KEEPING WITH RESISTING SOVIET IMPERIALISM WITH
A STRONG NATO AND WITH RESISTING THE SOVIET UNION
IN WESTERN EUROPE, AFRICA AND THE MIDDLE EAST. SO THESE MATTERS
DON'T HAVE ANY RELEVANCE IN TERMS OF TODAY.
TENG: IT HAS ALREADY BEEN ONE YEAR SINCE PRESIDENT
CARTER ASSUMED OFFICE. ONE MIGHT DO A BALANCE SHEET
OF WHAT HE HAS GAINED AND WHAT HE HAS LOST FOR THE
US VIS-A-VIS THE SOVIET UNION.
KENNEDY: I THINK HISTORY IS A FAIR TEST. I SUPPORT
THAT CRITERION AND THAT CHALLENGE. THE SOVIET UNION
HAS SUFFERED SERIOUS REVERSALS IN AFRICA -- IN
SOMALIA, THE SUDAN, MOZAMBIQUE AND THE HORN OF
AFRICA. IN THE MIDDLE EAST IT HAS SUFFERED A
DEFEAT IN EGYPT; THERE THE SOVIET UNION'S ONLY ALLIES
ARE LIBYA AND IRAQ WHICH ARE NOT MAJOR POWERS IN THE
MID EAST AREAS. AS FOR THE WARSAW PACT COUNTRIES,
THE RELIABILITY, POLITICAL AND MILITARY, IS UNCERTAIN
FROM THE SOVIET STANDPOINT. THE WARSAW PACT
TROOPS IN EASTERN EUROPE ARE UNCERTAIN IN TERMS OF
THEIR FIGHTING ABILITY. THE SOVIET UNION SIGNED THE
HELSINKI AGREEMENTS AND IT IS NOW BEING ACCUSED AT
BELGRADE OF BASIC VIOLATIONS OF HUMAN RIGHTS. THE
SOVIET UNION IS LESS SELF-RELIANT THAN CHINA BY ITS
DEPENDENCE ON CREDITS. IT IS INCREASINGLY OBLIGATED
TO WESTERN EUROPE WHERE IT MUST REPAY ITS LOANS.
THEN THE COMMUNIST PARTIES OF WESTERN EUROPE AND
THE COMMUNIST PARTY OF THE SOVIET UNION ARE SEPARATED.

ALLIES OF THE SOVIET UNION. BASICALLY THEY
SUPPORT THE MEMBERSHIP OF THEIR COUNTRIES IN NATO.
AT THE PRESENT TIME THE US HAS 8000 NUCLEAR WARHEADS
VS. 4000 SOVIET NUCLEAR WARHEADS. THE US HAS 7000
TACTICAL NUCLEAR WEAPONS IN WESTERN EUROPE. THE
MILITARY CAPABILITY OF THE US AND ITS ALLIES IS UNMATCHED.
TENG: BUT THINGS DON'T STOP AT THIS POINT. THERE
WILL BE NEW EVENTS AND NEW CHANGES. THERE IS ONE
POINT WHERE I DIFFER. IN MY OPINION SOVIET MILITARY
STRENGTH HAS SURPASSED THAT OF THE US. IN STRATEGIC
WEAPONS THE SOVIET UNION HAS ACHIEVED ROUGH PARITY
WITH THE US. IN NUCLEAR STRENGTH THE SOVIET UNION
IS QUITE CLOSE TO THE US. BUT IN CONVENTIONAL
WEAPONS THE SOVIET UNION IS GREATER THAN THE US AND
WESTERN EUROPE PUT TOGETHER. I AGREE WITH YOU THAT
THERE ARE INDICATORS OF SOVIET WEAKNESS THAT THE SOVIET
UNION HAS SUFFERED SOME SETBACKS IN GLOBAL STRATEGIC
DEVELOPMENT. BUT SOVIET UNION WILL NOT BE RECONCILED
TO THESE SETBACKS SO WE MUST BE ON THE ALERT. THE
SOVIET UNION HAS TAKEN SOME MEASURES TO COMPENSATE
FOR ITS DEFICIENCIES INCLUDING SUPPLY OF FOOD GRAINS
BY YOU TO HELP THE SOVIET UNION SOLVE ITS DIFFICULTIES.
SO THE SOVIET UNION IS STORING FOOD GRAINS
IN PREPARATION FOR WAR. ONE OTHER SOVIET WEAKNESS
IS ITS LOW LEVEL OF UNDERSTANDING OF TECHNOLOGY, AND
YOU ARE HELPING THE SOVIET UNION OVERCOME THIS
WEAKNESS. IF THE SOVIET UNION REACHES AN AGREEMENT
WITH ANOTHER COUNTRY IT WILL ALWAYS HAVE SOMETHING
TO GAIN. ONLY WHEN IT'S LOSING WILL IT REACH AN
AGREEMENT WITH YOU. SO WE INVARIABLY COUNSEL OUR
FRIENDS TO BE WATCHFUL. AS FOR THE SOVIET UNION,
WE CHERISH NO ILLUSIONS.
KENNEDY: IT WAS VERY KIND OF YOU TO RECEIVE US.
SINCERELY, WHEN I RETURN TO THE US I WILL URGE THE
PROCESS OF NORMALIZATION AND WILL TRY TO FIND WAYS TO
MOVE THE PROCESS FORWARD.

NEW CHINA. IN THE OLDDAYS WE WERE NOT ABLE TO FEED
OURSELVES. NOW WE HAVE ENOUGH TO EAT AND TO WEAR.
AS FAR AS CONDITIONS OF THE COUNTRY ARE
CONCERNED, WE WANT A MORE PEACEFUL ENVIRONMENT.
WHEN YOU HAVE UNDERSTOOD OUR CONDITIONS IT WILL BE
EASIER FOR YOU TO UNDERSTAND OUR POLITICAL ATTITUDES.
THAT IS WHY I THINK IT IS MOST IMPORTANT FOR YOU
TO COME TO CHINA YOURSELF. YOU ARE AN INFLUENTIAL
FIGURE AND I WANT TO EXPRESS A WARM WELCOME TO YOU.
KENNEDY: MR. VICE PREMIER, FIRST OF ALL I MUST
TELL YOU THAT WE WANT YOU TO KNOW HOW HOSPITABLE THE
CHINESE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN THESE PAST DAYS AND TO EXPRESS OUR APPRECIATION TO OUR HOSTS. AMBASSADOR HAO
AND THE GROUP FROM THE CHINESE PEOPLE'S INSTITUTE
FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS HAVE EXTENDED EVERY ASSISTANCE,
GOOD WILL AND PATIENCE. OUR TRAVELING COMPANIONS
HAVE BEEN ESPECIALLY KIND AND WARM TO ALL OF US.
WE APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SEE SOME FEATURES
OF LIFE OF CHINA WHICH HAVE BEEN EXTREMELY IMPORTANT
TO ME.
IN OUR FEW DAYS IN PEKING, WE HAVE HAD AN OPPORTUNITY
TO TALK TO AMBASSADOR HAO, THE FOREIGN MINISTER, AND
THE FOREIGN TRADE MINISTER REGARDING THE FUTURE OF
OUR PEOPLES. I AM MINDFUL OF THE STRONG HISTORICAL
TIES BETWEEN CHINA AND THE US. I AM MINDFUL OF THE
CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL
PAGE 03

PEKING 00044 01 OF 04 052238Z

EXTREME IMPORTANCE OF THE STRATEGIC QUESTION OF
SOVIET HEGEMONY. I CAME HERE IN THE BELIEF THAT THE
DESTINIES OF THE TWO PEOPLES ARE CLOSELY INTERTWINED AND I AM CONSCIOUS OF THE INTERRRUPTION OF
TWO DECADES OF A STRONG AND VITAL RELATIONSHIP.
I AM SURE THAT THE VICE PREMIER UNDERSTANDS MY STRONG
COMMITMENT TO NORMALIZATION OF RELATIONS ALONG THE
LINES OF THE SHANGHAI COMMUNIQUE. I RESPECT THE
PRINCIPLES STATED BY TH CHINESE GOVERNMENT ON THE
ISSUE OF TAIWAN, WHICH IS THE PRINCIPAL OBSTACLE TO
NORMALIZATION OF RELATIONS BETWEEN OUR TWO COUNTRIES.
I AM OPPOSED TO A TWO CHINA POLICY OR TO A ONE
CHINA ONE TAIWAN POLICY OR ANY OTHER SIMILAR
POLICIES. THE US MUST OBVIOUSLY MEET ITS REPSONSIBILITIES IN RESPECTING THE THREE PRINCIPLES WHICH ARE
CHINESE POLICY ON TAIWAN. MY OWN HOPE IS THAT IT
(I.E., NORMALIZATION OF RELATIONS) WILL BE SOONER
RATHER THAN LATER. THIS IS THE THOUGHT THAT YOUR
FOREIGN MINISTER AND AMBASSADOR HAO DELIVERED FOR ME
EARLIER.I AM SURE THAT VICE PREMIER TENG IS AWARE
THAT THE PROCESS CAN BE MADE MUCH MORE QUICK, RAPID
AND EXPEDITIOUS. IT CAN BE A LONGER OR MORE COMPLI-

CATED PROCESS IN THE US DEPENDING ON THE ATTITUDE
OF THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT AND THE CHINESE PEOPLE.
I AM PREPARED TO WORK FOR THAT PROCESS (I.E.,, A
SHORTER PROCESS)IN THE US SENATE. MY QUESTION TO
THE VICE PREMIER IS WHETHER HE BELIEVES THE ACTIONS
OF THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT WILL BE TO MAKE THAT PROCESS MORE ACTIVE AND RAPID OR TO THE CONTRARY.
I BELIEVE SOME OF THE STEPS WHICH CAN MOVE THE PROCESS
MORE PARIDLY WOULD BE AVAILABILITY OF TECHNOLOGY,
PARTICULARLY IN THE AREA OF PETROLEUM TECHNOLOGY,
BECAUSE OF ITS SUPERIORITY IN THE VIEW OF THE
CHINESE GOVERNMENT. THERE IS GREAT INTEREST IN THE
US TO WORK WITH THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT TO SEE THE
SALE OF TECHNOLOGY WITH ALL INTERNATIONAL MACHINERY

AVAILABLE. I THINK YOU WILL SEE A FURTHER DRAWING
DOWN OF US FORCES ON TAIWAN. WHAT HAS NOT BEEN LOST
AMONG THE PEOPLE OF MY STATE WAS THAT YOUR GOVERNMENT ALLOWED ME TO VISIT WITH THEIR RELATIVES IN
SHANGHAI AND TO EXPLORE THE POSSIBILITY OF A VISIT
OF THE FAMILY FOR HUMANIATARIAN REASONS. THESE ARE
ALL VERY CONSTRUCTIVE AND POSITIVE SIGNALS THAT ARE
RECEIVED IN THE US AT THE PRESENT TIME, AND THEY HELP
MOVE THE PROCESS FORWARD FROM OUR POINT OF VIEW.
AND WE RECOGNIZE OUR RESPONSIBILITY IN THE US
AND IN THE SENATE OF THE US TO MOVE THIS PROCESS FORWARD.
SO THESE TYPES OF THINGS WILL HELP MOVE THE
PROCESS FORWARD MORE RAPIDLY. I WOULD BE INTERESTED
IN THE VIEWS OF THE VICE PREMIER ON WHETHER
THRE WILL BE A DIFFICULT TIME OR PERHAPS A TIME OF
UNDERSTANDING OF POLITICAL REALITIES THAT EXIST IN
US-PRC RELATIONS AT THIS TIME.
TENG:ACTUALLY THE PROBLEM EXISTING BETWEEN CHINA
AND THE US IS TWOFOLD. AS FAR AS OUR BILATERAL RELATIONS ARE CONCERNED THE CRUCIAL PROBLEM FOR NORMALIZATION OF RELATIONS IS THE QUESTION OF TAIWAN. THIS
IS MOST IMPORTANT. WE HAVE ALWAYS SAID THAT IN RELATIONS IN CHINA AND THE US THRE ARE ALSO VIEWS ON
INTERNATIONAL POLICY ISSUES. IN 1972 THEN PRESIDENT
NIXON AND SECRETARY KISSINGER CAME TO CHINA AND
BOTH SIDES ISSUED THE SHANGHAI COMMUNIQUE. AND THEN
OUR TWO COUNTRIES HAVE FOUND A GREATER NUMBER OF
POINTS OF SIMILAR OPINION ON INTERNATIONAL ISSUES
AND WE HAVE SO STATED ON A NUMBER OF OCCASIONS.
SPECIFICALLY THERE IS THE QUESTION OF HOW TO DEAL
WITH THE POLAR BEAR. THAT IS, WITH THE EXPANSIONSISM
OF THE POLAR BEAR AS YOU HAVE SAID RIGHT NOW. THERE

NON-GOVERNMENTAL EXCHANGES AND TRADE. WHEN MR.
VANCE VISITED CHINA LAST YEAR WE DISCUSSED THIS
QUESTION AND HE SAID HE AGREED WITH THE THREE CONDITIONS AND WOULD UPHOLD THE SHANGHAI COMMUNIQUE. BUT
HE PROPOSED A US GOVERNMENT AGENCY ON TAIWAN BY
WHATEVER NAME. SO THIS IS THE KEY QUESTION. ONE
OTHER POINT HE RAISED WHAT THAT THE US GOVERNMENT
COULD AGREE TO THE THREE CONDITIONS WHILE NOT ESTABISHING A GOVERNMENT AGENCY ON TAIWAN BUT THE CHINESE
GOVERNMENT SHOULD COMMIT ITSELF NOT TO SOLVE THE TAIWAN
ISSUE BY FORCE. WE MADE VERY CLEAR OUR POSITION

AND ATTITUDE ON THIS ISSUE IN THE PAST. WE STATED
THE SAME POSITION TO PRESIDENT NIXON AND SECRETARY
KISSINGER, TO PRESIDENT FORD AND SECRETARY KISSINGER,
AND TO MR. VANCE. THE QUESTION OF TAIWAN INVOLVES
SOVEREIGNTY. THERE ARE NO TERMS FOR NEGOTIATIONS
ON MATTERS OF SOVEREIGNTY. IN THIS REGARD WE DO
NOT AGREE TO THE STATEMENT OF SOME FRIENDS THAT
CHINA HAS SHOWN FLEXIBILITY ON THIS ISSUE. THERE
IS NO FLEXIBILITY WHATSOEVER. SOVEREIGNTY IS VERY
SERIOUS. THERE IS NO ROOM FOR FLEXIBILTY. IF
FLEXIBILITY IS TO BE SPECIFIED, THERE IS THE JAPANESE
FORMULA. THE OTHER FLEXIBILITY IS THAT IF THE US
NEEDS TAIWAN NOW, WE CAN WAIT. SOME HAVE BEEN VERY
FRANK IN THIS MATTER. AS FOR THE COMMITMENT NOT TO
SETTLE THE TAIWAN PROBLEM BY FORCE, THAT CHINA IS
ASKED TO UNDERTAKE, WE SAY AS TO HOW AND WHEN WE
LIBERATE TAIWAN, IT IS CHINA'S INTERNAL AFFAIR. IN

MY TALK WITH JOURNALISTS FROM THE ASSOCIATED PRESS,
I TOLD THEM THAT CHINA COULD NOT POSSIBLY UNDERTAKE
A COMMITMENT ON THE INTERNAL AFFAIRS OF THE CHINESE
PEOPLE. BUT I TOLD THEM THAT CHINA WOULD TAKE NOTE
OF PARTICULAR CONDITIONS IN TAIWAN IN SETTLING THIS
ISSUE. THE PROPOSAL BROUGHT TO CHINA BY MR. VANCE
LAST AUGUST CANNOT WORK. WE ARE MERELY RESTATING
OUR POSITION AND MAKING IT CLEAR TO YOU.AS TO
WHEN THE US MAKES UP ITS MIND, IT IS EASY TO SETTLE
THIS QUESTION. WE CAN WAIT IF THE US NEEDS SOME
MORE TIME.
KENNEDY: I RESPECT AND I UNDERSTAND YOUR POSITION.
THERE ARE POLITICAL PERCEPTIONS IN THE US AS TO MOVING
THE PROCESS OF NORMALIZATION FORWARD AND THERE ARE
PROBLEMS FOR THE POLITICAL LEADERSHIP IN THE US.
AS A BRAVE AND EFFECTIVE FORMER SOLDIER, THE VICE
PREMIER UNDERSTANDS THE FORCES AT WORK ON THE CHINA
QUESTION WITHIN THE US. RIGHTLY OR WRONGLY, SOME IN

IN THE FACE OF JAPANESE AGGRESSION. IT WAS AFTER
THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE BOGUS WANG CHI-WIE GOVERNMENT AND AFTERCHIANG KAI-SHEK BECAME PRESIDENT OF
THE BOGUS GOVERNMENT IN NANKING THAT CHIANG FOLLOWED
A POLICY OF NON-RESISTANCE TOWARD THE JAPANESE. AND
ON THIS POINT WE ARE VERY GRATEFUL TO HIM. HE GAVE

JAPANESE SO THAT THE 8TH ROUTE ARMY AND THE 4TH ROUTE
ARMY COULD MOBILIZE 30,000 TROOPS.
KENNEDY: THAT IS WHY I SAID IT IS A PERCEPTION, NOT
A FACT OR A REALITY.
TENG: THESE 30,000 TROOPS SLIPPED INTO THE AREA
CONTROLLED BY CHIANG AND THEY WAGED GUERRILLA WARFARE.
AFTER 8 YEARS OF RESISTANCE TO JAPAN, THESE
30,000 TROOPS TURNED INTO 1,200,000 REGULAR TROOPS.
IN ADDITION TO THAT THERE WERE LARGE NUMBERS OF
REGULAR MILITIA. THE CHINESE PEOPLE KNOW BEST THE ATTITUDE
OF CHIANG TOWARD JAPANESE AGGRESSION. FOREIGNERS
DO NOT UNDERSTAND AFFAIRS IN CHINA. AT THE END OF
WORLD WAR II WHEN THE KMT AND CHINESE COMMUNIST PARTY
NEGOTIATED FOR PEACE, CHIANG ATTACKED OUR BASES WITH
HIS SENIOR MILITARY ADVISORS, THE FORMER COMMANDERIN-CHIEF OF THE JAPANESE TROOPS STATIONED IN NORTH CHINA.
KENNEDY: MANY TIMES PERCEPTIONS ARE DIFFERENT FROM
FACTS. I RESPECT THE FACTS AS YOU HAVE STATED THEM.
IT IS VERY IMPORTANT TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WHO FOUGHT
AGAINST JAPAN. SOME OF THE PEOPLE NOW ON TAIWAN
FOUGHT AGAINST JAPAN. PERCEPTIONS OF CHANGE ON
TAIWAN WILL ALSO HAVE IMPORTANT EFFECTS ON THE US
POSITION IN EAST ASIA, JUST AS THE CARTER ANNOUNCEMENT

THE STATUS OF TAIWAN WILL HAVE REPERCUSSIONS WHICH MAY WELL
BE REFLECTED TO THE ADVANTAGE OF THE POLAR BEAR.
TENG: THE RESULT WOULD BE JUST TO THE CONTRARY. IF
THE USG MAKES UP ITS MIND TO NORMALIZE RELATIONS AND
TO RESOLVE THE TAIWAN ISSUE ON THE BASIS OF THE THREE
PRINCIPLES, THIS WOULD HAVE GOOD RESULTS FOR THE US
THROUGHOUT THE WORLD AND WOULD HELP YOUR EFFORTS TO
DEAL WITH THE POLAR BEAR. THE SOVIET SOCIALIST
IMPERIALISTS FEAR MOST THE NORMALIZATION OF RELATIONS
BETWEEN OUR TWO COUNTRIES. THERE ARE SOME WHO RAISE
THE ISSUE THAT IF THE US WITHDRAWS ITS TROOPS FROM
TAIWAN, AND HAS NO TIES WITH TAIWAN EXCEPT NONGOVERNMENTAL TIES, THE SOVIET UNION WILL FILL IN THE
VACUUM. I SIMPLY DON'T BELIEVE SUCH ISSUES, AND I
BELIEVE SUCH ISSUES ARE UNCALLED FOR. WE HAVE INTERESTS
IN TAIWAN TOO, SO THERE IS NO NEED FOR SUCH
ISSUES. SO THE QUESTION NOW INVOLVES WHETHER THE

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
US NEEDS TAIWAN NOW. IF IT NEEDS TAIWAN NOW, I
WILL REITERATE THAT WE WILL BE PATIENT. IN THE END
THE CHINESE PEOPLE WILL RESOLVE THE ISSUE OF TAIWAN.
PEOPLE OF MY AGE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO SEE THE GOAL FULFILLED BUT PEOPLE AT THE AGE OF CHAIRMAN HUA KUOFENG WILL BE ABLE TO SEE THAT. I WISH TO STATE
AGAIN THAT THE QUESTION OF TAIWAN IS BUT ONE QUESTION
IN THE NORMALIZATION OF RELATIONS. WE ARE BOTH
CONFRONTED WITH INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL ISSUES TOO.
BEFORE NORMALIZATION OCCURS, WE STILL HAVE POINTS OF
AGREEMENT ON OTHER ISSUES. WE CAN CONTINUE OUR
DISCUSSIONS. APART FROM FOREIGN POLICY DISCUSSIONS, WE
ALSO HAVE EXCHANGES GOING ON BETWEEN OUR TWO SIDES.
BEFORE NORMALIZATION THESE EXCHANGES WILL BE IMPEDED
NOT ONLY FROM CHINA BUT ALSO FROM THE USG. ON THE
PART OF CHINA, WE HOLD THAT THE NON-GOVERNMENTAL
CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL
PAGE 03

PEKING 00044 03 OF 04 052240Z

EXCHANGES BETWEEN CHINA AND THE US SHOULD NOT EXCEED
THOSE BETWEEN CHINA AND OTHER COUNTRIES WHICH HAVE
DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS WITH US. AS TO THE US GOVERNMENT
POSITION, IF THERE IS SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
THAT WE NEED YOU WILL NOT GIVE THIS TO US.
KENNEDY: THERE ARE SOME PARTICULAR AREAS, COMPUTERS
AND OTHERS, WHICH HAVE BEEN RESOLVED. I BELIEVE THAT
YOU WILL FIND THAT THERE WILL BE LESS RESTRICTIONS
ON PURCHASES BY CHINA. CERTAINLY IN THE US SENATE
I WILL STRONGLY URGE THE ADMINISTRATION TO EXERT
PRESSURE ON BEHALF OF REDUCING RESTRICTIONS ON SALES
TO YOU.
TENG: THE COMPUTERS YOU MENTIONED ARE ONE CASE IN
POINT. WHEN WE DISCUSSED THIS QUESTION WITH DR.
KISSINGER HE PROPOSED THAT THE US GOVERNMENT WOULD
INTERVENE AND WOULD HELP NEGOTIATIONS ON THIS POINT.
HOW IS THIS POSSIBLE IF OUR TWO GOVERNMENTS HAVE NOT
NORMALIZED RELATIONS? ONE OTHER EXAMPLE. WE ARE
TRYING TO BUY SEOMTHING FROM CERTAIN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES
BUT PART OF THE TECHNOLOGY INVOLVED COMES FROM THE
US. THE US WOULD NOT AGREE TO SALE OF IT. YOU HAVE
SHARES IN LOTS OF MULTI-NATIONAL CORPORATIONS IN
EUROPE (LAUGHTER). SO IN THE FINAL ANALYSIS THE
QUESTION OF NORMALIZATION OF RELATIONS BETWEEN OUR
TWO COUNTRIES CAN BE SETTLED ONLY IF YOU APPROACH
THIS QUESTION FROM THE POLICY POINT OF VIEW. WE
MUST ALSO LOOK AT THIS QUESTION FROM A LONG TERM
STRATEGY POINT OF VIEW. IF YOU DO THAT, THINGS WILL
DEVELOP ALONG THE DESIRED COURSE. TECHNOLOGY,
CULTURAL EXCHANGES, ECONOMIC AGREEMENTS AND SO FORTH
WILL FOLLOW FROM IT.

SUPPLY OF FOOD GRAINS, SUPPORT OF TECHNOLOGY SALES
TO THE SOVIET UNION YOU WILL BE ABLE TO CURB SOVIET
EXPANSIONISM. I THINK PERHAPS SOME OF THESE ITEMS
WILL ONLY INFLATE SOVIET EXPANSIONISM. THE SENATOR
KNOWS THE SOVIET UNION BETTER THAN I. HOW MANY TIMES HAVE
YOU VISITED THE SOVIET UNION?
KENNEDY: JUST ONCE.
TENG: JUST ONCE? I HAVE BEEN TO THE SOVIET UNION
SEVEN TIMES. I KNOW MANY SOVIET LEADERS.
KENNEDY: I DON'T UNDERSTAND THIS WORLD APPEASEMENT.
AMBASSADOR HAO, FOREIGN MINISTER HUANG AND VICE
PREMIER ALL USE IT AND UNDERSTAND IT IN ITS HISTORICAL
MEANING, BUT IT HAS NO RELEVANCE FOR TODAY.

DALADIER AND PERHAPS SOME AMERICANS HAD A HAND IN

IN HIS EXPANSION. PERHAPS APPEASEMENT IN THE US
TODAY IS CALLED THE SONNENFELDT DOCTRINE.
KENNEDY: I DO NOT UNDERSTAND HOW APPEASEMENT CAN BE
ASSOCIATED WITH THE SONNENFELDT DOCTRINE OR WITH
PRM 10. THE US HAS MILITARY, ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL
STRENGTH AND IS PREPARED TO USE IT. THIS HAS NO RELEVANCE TO THE CHAMBERLAIN POLICY OF WORLD WAR II. THE

SONNELFELDT DOCTRINE IS INTERESTING FOR ONE WHO
FOLLOWED WEST EUROPEAN AFFAIRS AS VICE CHAIRMAN OF
THE NATO DEFENSE COMMITTEE FOR FOUR YEARS. THE
SONNENFELDT DOCTRINE IS A TERM BASICALLY TAKEN OUT
OF CONTEXT. THE SONNENFELDT DOCTRINE IS ENTIRELY
IN KEEPING WITH RESISTING SOVIET IMPERIALISM WITH
A STRONG NATO AND WITH RESISTING THE SOVIET UNION
IN WESTERN EUROPE, AFRICA AND THE MIDDLE EAST. SO THESE MATTERS
DON'T HAVE ANY RELEVANCE IN TERMS OF TODAY.
TENG: IT HAS ALREADY BEEN ONE YEAR SINCE PRESIDENT
CARTER ASSUMED OFFICE. ONE MIGHT DO A BALANCE SHEET
OF WHAT HE HAS GAINED AND WHAT HE HAS LOST FOR THE
US VIS-A-VIS THE SOVIET UNION.
KENNEDY: I THINK HISTORY IS A FAIR TEST. I SUPPORT
THAT CRITERION AND THAT CHALLENGE. THE SOVIET UNION
HAS SUFFERED SERIOUS REVERSALS IN AFRICA -- IN
SOMALIA, THE SUDAN, MOZAMBIQUE AND THE HORN OF
AFRICA. IN THE MIDDLE EAST IT HAS SUFFERED A
DEFEAT IN EGYPT; THERE THE SOVIET UNION'S ONLY ALLIES
ARE LIBYA AND IRAQ WHICH ARE NOT MAJOR POWERS IN THE
MID EAST AREAS. AS FOR THE WARSAW PACT COUNTRIES,
THE RELIABILITY, POLITICAL AND MILITARY, IS UNCERTAIN
FROM THE SOVIET STANDPOINT. THE WARSAW PACT
TROOPS IN EASTERN EUROPE ARE UNCERTAIN IN TERMS OF
THEIR FIGHTING ABILITY. THE SOVIET UNION SIGNED THE
HELSINKI AGREEMENTS AND IT IS NOW BEING ACCUSED AT
BELGRADE OF BASIC VIOLATIONS OF HUMAN RIGHTS. THE
SOVIET UNION IS LESS SELF-RELIANT THAN CHINA BY ITS
DEPENDENCE ON CREDITS. IT IS INCREASINGLY OBLIGATED
TO WESTERN EUROPE WHERE IT MUST REPAY ITS LOANS.
THEN THE COMMUNIST PARTIES OF WESTERN EUROPE AND
THE COMMUNIST PARTY OF THE SOVIET UNION ARE SEPARATED.

ALLIES OF THE SOVIET UNION. BASICALLY THEY
SUPPORT THE MEMBERSHIP OF THEIR COUNTRIES IN NATO.
AT THE PRESENT TIME THE US HAS 8000 NUCLEAR WARHEADS
VS. 4000 SOVIET NUCLEAR WARHEADS. THE US HAS 7000
TACTICAL NUCLEAR WEAPONS IN WESTERN EUROPE. THE
MILITARY CAPABILITY OF THE US AND ITS ALLIES IS UNMATCHED.
TENG: BUT THINGS DON'T STOP AT THIS POINT. THERE
WILL BE NEW EVENTS AND NEW CHANGES. THERE IS ONE
POINT WHERE I DIFFER. IN MY OPINION SOVIET MILITARY
STRENGTH HAS SURPASSED THAT OF THE US. IN STRATEGIC
WEAPONS THE SOVIET UNION HAS ACHIEVED ROUGH PARITY
WITH THE US. IN NUCLEAR STRENGTH THE SOVIET UNION
IS QUITE CLOSE TO THE US. BUT IN CONVENTIONAL
WEAPONS THE SOVIET UNION IS GREATER THAN THE US AND
WESTERN EUROPE PUT TOGETHER. I AGREE WITH YOU THAT
THERE ARE INDICATORS OF SOVIET WEAKNESS THAT THE SOVIET
UNION HAS SUFFERED SOME SETBACKS IN GLOBAL STRATEGIC
DEVELOPMENT. BUT SOVIET UNION WILL NOT BE RECONCILED
TO THESE SETBACKS SO WE MUST BE ON THE ALERT. THE
SOVIET UNION HAS TAKEN SOME MEASURES TO COMPENSATE
FOR ITS DEFICIENCIES INCLUDING SUPPLY OF FOOD GRAINS
BY YOU TO HELP THE SOVIET UNION SOLVE ITS DIFFICULTIES.
SO THE SOVIET UNION IS STORING FOOD GRAINS
IN PREPARATION FOR WAR. ONE OTHER SOVIET WEAKNESS
IS ITS LOW LEVEL OF UNDERSTANDING OF TECHNOLOGY, AND
YOU ARE HELPING THE SOVIET UNION OVERCOME THIS
WEAKNESS. IF THE SOVIET UNION REACHES AN AGREEMENT
WITH ANOTHER COUNTRY IT WILL ALWAYS HAVE SOMETHING
TO GAIN. ONLY WHEN IT'S LOSING WILL IT REACH AN
AGREEMENT WITH YOU. SO WE INVARIABLY COUNSEL OUR
FRIENDS TO BE WATCHFUL. AS FOR THE SOVIET UNION,
WE CHERISH NO ILLUSIONS.
KENNEDY: IT WAS VERY KIND OF YOU TO RECEIVE US.
SINCERELY, WHEN I RETURN TO THE US I WILL URGE THE
PROCESS OF NORMALIZATION AND WILL TRY TO FIND WAYS TO
MOVE THE PROCESS FORWARD.
