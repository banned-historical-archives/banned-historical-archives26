		<h3>Tor</h3>
		<p><a href="https://www.torproject.org">Tor</a> is an encrypted anonymising network that makes it harder to intercept internet communications, or see where communications are coming from or going to.</p>
		<p>In order to use the WikiLeaks public submission system as detailed above you can download the Tor Browser Bundle, which is a Firefox-like browser available for Windows, Mac OS X and GNU/Linux and pre-configured to connect using the anonymising system Tor.</p>
		<h4>Tails</h4>
		<p>If you are at high risk and you have the capacity to do so, you can also access the submission system through a secure operating system called <a href="https://tails.boum.org">Tails</a>. Tails is an operating system launched from a USB stick or a DVD that aim to leaves no traces when the computer is shut down after use and automatically routes your internet traffic through Tor. Tails will require you to have either a USB stick or a DVD at least 4GB big and a laptop or desktop computer.</p>

		<h3>Tips</h3>
		<p>Our submission system works hard to preserve your anonymity, but we recommend you also take some of your own precautions. Please review these basic guidelines. </p>
		<div>
			<h4>1. Contact us if you have specific problems</h4>
			<p>If you have a very large submission, or a submission with a complex format, or are a high-risk source, please <a href="#submit_help_contact">contact us</a>. In our experience it is always possible to find a custom solution for even the most seemingly difficult situations.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h4>2. What computer to use</h4>
			<p>If the computer you are uploading from could subsequently be audited in an investigation, consider using a computer that is not easily tied to you. Technical users can also use <a href="https://tails.boum.org">Tails</a> to help ensure you do not leave any records of your submission on the computer.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h4>3. Do not talk about your submission to others</h4>
			<p>If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in source protection – it is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This includes other media organisations.</p>
		</div>

	</div>

		<h3>After</h3>

		<div>
			<h4>1. Do not talk about your submission to others</h4>
			<p>If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in source protection – it is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This includes other media organisations.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h4>2. Act normal</h4>
			<p>If you are a high-risk source, avoid saying anything or doing anything after submitting which might promote suspicion. In particular, you should try to stick to your normal routine and behaviour.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h4>3. Remove traces of your submission</h4>
			<p>If you are a high-risk source and the computer you prepared your submission on, or uploaded it from, could subsequently be audited in an investigation, we recommend that you format and dispose of the computer hard drive and any other storage media you used.</p>
			<p>In particular, hard drives retain data after formatting which may be visible to a digital forensics team and flash media (USB sticks, memory cards and SSD drives) retain data even after a secure erasure. If you used flash media to store sensitive data, it is important to destroy the media.</p>
			<p>If you do this and are a high-risk source you should make sure there are no traces of the clean-up, since such traces themselves may draw suspicion.</p>
			<div>
				<h4>4. If you face legal action</h4>
				<p>If a legal action is brought against you as a result of your submission, there are organisations that may help you. The Courage Foundation is an international organisation dedicated to the protection of journalistic sources. You can find more details at <a href="https://www.couragefound.org">https://www.couragefound.org</a>.</p>

		<p>WikiLeaks publishes documents of political or historical importance that are censored or otherwise suppressed. We specialise in strategic global publishing and large archives.</p>
		<p>The following is the address of our secure site where you can anonymously upload your documents to WikiLeaks editors. You can only access this submissions system through Tor. (See our <a href="#submit_help_tor">Tor tab</a> for more information.) We also advise you to read our <a href="#submit_help_tips">tips for sources</a> before submitting.</p>

			<!--<div>
				Copy this address into your Tor browser. Advanced users, if they wish, can also add a further layer of encryption to their submission using <a href="#submit_wlkey">our public PGP key</a>.
			</div>-->
		</div>

		<p>If you cannot use Tor, or your submission is very large, or you have specific requirements, WikiLeaks provides several alternative methods. <a href="#submit_help_contact">Contact us</a> to discuss how to proceed.</p>

W/O CONSULTING WH/DOS, WOODCOCK DID NOT MAKE IT ANY
EASIER FOR PRES FULFILL ULTIMATE HOPE OF ESTABLISHING
NORMAL RELS W/PRC. SAYS US COULD MEET PRC'S THREE
CONDITIONS FOR NORMALIZATION TOMORROW W/&quot;VIRTUALLY NO

BEGIN LOBBY ON CAPITOL FOR CHANGE IN RELATIONSHIP SO LONG
AS STRUGGLING TO WIN APPROVAL PANAMA CANAL TREATY/SALT/
MIDDLE EAST ISSUES. FOR WOODCOCK TO PROD PRES NOW IS
&quot;DISSERVICE,&quot; SIGNALS PRC THAT US AMB, WHO IS SUPPOSED TO
BE &quot;TOUGH NEGOTIATOR,&quot; IS PREPARED CONCLUDE DEAL W/O
BARGAINING FOR SOMETHING IN EXCHANGE. SAYS WOODCOCK'S
ACTIONS EXAMPLE OF &quot;CLIENTISM&quot;--WHEN ENVOY BEGINS REPRESENT
COUNTRY ASSIGNED TO RATHER THAN US--AND ALSO ANOTHER
EXAMPLE OF &quot;AMATUERISM,&quot; WHICH &quot;HAS BECOME ALL TOO
CHARACTERISTIC&quot; OF CARTER ADMIN'S CONDUCT ABROAD.

MADE CHINA POLICY LOW PRIORITY FOR ADMIN. SAYS BEFORE

NEGOTIATED. NOTES SOME USG ANALYSTS FEAR NORMALIZATION

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
MIGHT FORCE ROC ENHANCE OWN DEFENSES BY SEEKING SOVIET
ARMS OR EMBARKING ON CRASH NUKE DEFENSE PROGRAM--AND THAT
PRC REACTION TO THIS WOULD BE FORCEFUL.
THOMPSON SAYS THIS CRISIS SCENARIO IS ONE OF BEST REASONS
OF ALL FOR SPEEDY NORMALIZATION, AS THAT AGREEMENT WOULD
ALSO CONTAIN UNDERSTANDING ON TAIWAN ISSUE. CONCLUDES
CARTER HAS IMMEDIATE OBLIGATION REDUCE CHANCE OF US/PRC
CONFLICT, AND THIS CAN ONLY BE DONE THRU ESTABLISHING
DIPLO RELS.

SUGGESTS US PREPARED GRANT CONSIDERABLE CONCESSIONS IN
ORDER ATTAIN NORMALIZATION RAPIDLY. SAYS WOODCOCK'S
RECENT COMMENTS INDICATE &quot;LOW POSTURE APPROACH&quot; STILL IN
EFFECT.
LINDSAY SUGGESTS IF US WERE TO ABANDON ROC TO WIN PEKING'S
FAVOR, THIS WOULD GIVE CHINESE LEADERS CAUSE SUSPECT THAT
US WOULD HAVE EVEN LESS SCRUPLES ABOUT ABANDONING THEM IF
IT SEEMED EXPEDIENT TO WIN SOVIET FAVOR. FURTHER SUGGESTS
IF WOODCOCK COULD REASON CLEARLY AS CHINESE, HE MIGHT
SUSPECT THAT PRC LEADERS INSISTENT ON TAIWAN ISSUE BECAUSE
THEY WANT SOMETHING THEY CAN ONLY GET FROM US BEFORE
SEEKING DETENTE W/SOVIETS (WP).
TINLEY AKAR, INFO OFFICER IN NYC &quot;OFFICE OF TIBET&quot;

CITIZENS OF US/CANADA MUST HAVE CHINA, RATHER THAN TIBET,
AS COUNTRY OF BIRTH ON PASSPORTS. OBSERVES MOST TIBETANS
WHO APPLIED FOR PASSPORTS WERE BORN IN TIBET IN '40S WHEN
IT WAS DE FACTO/DE JURE INDEPENDENT NATION.
AKAR SAYS CHINESE VERY SENSITIVE ABOUT TIBET ISSUE &quot;BECAUSE
OF THEIR INSECURITY AND TIBETAN RESISTANCE TO CHINESE

SUCCESSORS HAVE PUSHED MAO PRINCIPLES SO FAR THAT BECOME
OPEN QUESTION WHETHER THEY HAVE TRANSFORMED THEM INTO
NEW APPROACH.
ON ANOTHER TOPIC, BUTTERFIELD OBSERVES PEKING HAS
RECONCILED SELF TO SLOWNESS OF US MOVEMENT TOWARD
NORMALIZATION. NOTES IN SECRET SPEECH GIVEN LAST SUMMER,
FONMIN HUANG HUA ALLEGED TO HAVE TOLD OFFICIALS THAT
PEKING NOT SATISFIED W/WASHINGTON'S PERFORMANCE BUT THAT
IT ACCEPTED THAT THERE WOULD BE NO NORMALIZATION FOR

BUTTERFIELD (NYT TAIPEI 2/18) REPORTS THAT SEVERAL ROC
SECURITY AGENCIES CONCERNED BY INTELLIGENCE REPORTS THAT
PEKING BEGAN ESTABLISHING LARGE NUMBER SPECIAL &quot;WORK
TEAMS&quot; IN '77 TO INFILTRATE ROC. ACCORDING TO MAJ/GEN
TUAN CHIA-FENG, SPOKESMAN FOR ROC GARRISON COMMAND, TEAMS
MAY REPRESENT PART OF PRC STRATEGY DEVISED BY MAO'S
SUCCESSORS TO TAKE OVER ROC W/O ARMED INVASION. BUTTERFIELD
NOTES THAT FEARS OF INCREASED COMMUNIST SUBVERSION
HEIGHTENED BY CONVICTION OF 6 TAIWANESE IN JAN FOR SENDING
THREATENING LTRS TO FON BUSINESSMEN IN NAME OF PROCOMMUNIST GROUP, TAIWAN PEOPLE LIBERATION FRONT. DESPITE
FACT THAT GROC STARTED MINOR CAMPAIGN IN RECENT MONTHS
TO UNCOVER COMMUNISTS, NO REAL COMMUNIST EFFORTS AT
INFLITRATION HAVE BEEN DISCLOSED. BUTTERFIELD OFFERS
THAT GREATER DANGER TO NATIONALIST CONTROL MAY STEM FROM
RESENTMENT MANY TAIWANESE FEEL AGAINST MAINLANDERS'
CONTINUED POL DOMINANCE OF ISLAND.

12. VIETNAM
NYT (EDIT 2/19) SAYS MOST PROFOUND CONSEQUENCES OF TET
ARE NOW PLAIN--IT EXPOSED NEW US CONSENSUS, THUS DESTROYING
CONSENSUS FOR CONTAINING COMMUNISM ALMOST ANYWHERE OUR
LEADERS THOUGHT NECESSARY, AT VIRTUALLY ANY PRICE. NOTES
PRES CARTER INHERITED HOST OF COMMITMENTS/INVOLVEMENTS
ON ALL CONTINENTS--AND MUCH DIMINISHED AUTHORITY TO MANAGE
THEM. SAYS CARTER UNDERSTANDS SHIFTS OF PUBLIC SENTIMENT,
HAS TRIED ADJUST POLICY TO THEM, BUT HAS BEEN UNABLE
LOCATE NEW DOCTRINES TO SHAPE ORDER OF OUR INTERESTS.
NYT SAYS HE HAS DE-EMPHASIZED DANGER OF COMMUNISM/PROCLAIMED INSTEAD OVERRIDING DEDICATION TO HUMAN RTS, TO
NUKE DISARMAMENT AS WELL AS ARMS CONTROL, TO FON AID
INSTEAD OF ARMS SALES. CONCLUDES MUCH HAS BEEN GAINED
FROM COLLAPSE OF CONSENSUS THAT GOT US INTO VN, &quot;BUT WITH
NO COMPARABLY CLEAR PURPOSE IN ITS PLACE, SOMETHING HAS
ALSO BEEN LOST.&quot;

UNHAPPY&quot; OVER DISAPPEARANCE THAI FAMILIES INTO CAMBODIA,
ABDUCTED, ACCORDING FONMIN UPPADIT, BY CAMBODIAN
TROOPS/THAI INSURGENTS. UPPADIT SAID ATTACKS MIGHT BE
RESULT POOR COMMUNICATIONS IN CAMBODIA OR LACK DISCIPLINE
BY FIELD CMRDS.
KAMM SAYS SINCE KRIANGSAK CAME TO POWER, RTG AT PAINS TO
REDUCE TENSION W/PP, GOES TO GREAT LENGTHS NOT HOLD
CAMBODIAN GOVT RESPONSIBLE FOR FREQUENT INCURSIONS.
SAYS DEEP DIVISIONS EXIST IN THAILAND ABOUT THIS POLICY.

15. THAILAND
IN ANOTHER IN SERIES ON PROTECTIONISM, JOC'S LORENZ

CONSIDERED GROUNDSHAKING, THAT PRESTIGE-CONSCIOUS
RESIDENTS INFORMED WELL IN ADVANCE OF BAN ON MERCEDES/

SINCE MOST BANNED ITEMS PRODUCED LOCALLY. SEES MALAYSIA/

17. JAPAN
IN ITEM ON US COAL STRIKE, JANEWAY (WSTAR 2/19) ASKS WHY
PRESSURE JAPANESE TO CUT STEEL EXPORTS IF US MILLS WILL
BE FORCED SHUT DOWN ANYWAY? WONDERS WHY SEND STRAUSS TO
JAPAN TO PROPOSE OPEN DOOR FOR US EXPORTS IF COAL FLOW
JAPAN SEEKS JEOPARDIZED? REMARKS STRAUSS' MISSION TO
NEGOTIATE GREATER US EXPORTS TO JAPAN &quot;LAUDIBLE AND
PRACTICAL,&quot; BUT SAYS METHOD TO ACHIEVE GOAL IS BY LINKING

18. CHINA
KARNOW (SUN 2/20) WRITES THAT CARTER ADMIN &quot;BLUNDERED
AGAIN&quot; WHEN WOODCOCK CAME OUT IN FAVOR OF ABANDONING RELS
W/TAIWAN AND ACCORDING PRC FULL RECOGNITION. SAYS WHILE
HE AGREES W/WOODCOCK'S POSITION, BY SPEAKING OUT ON OWN
W/O CONSULTING WH/DOS, WOODCOCK DID NOT MAKE IT ANY
EASIER FOR PRES FULFILL ULTIMATE HOPE OF ESTABLISHING
NORMAL RELS W/PRC. SAYS US COULD MEET PRC'S THREE
CONDITIONS FOR NORMALIZATION TOMORROW W/&quot;VIRTUALLY NO
DANGER&quot; OF CONFLICT IN AREA. BUT THIS REALITY BLURRED
BY WIDESPREAD MISPERCEPTION IN US THAT BY ABROGATING
MUTUAL DEFENSE TREATY W/ROC, US WOULD BE SACRIFICING ISLAND
TO COMMUNIST RULE.
UNCLASSIFIED
PAGE 13

STATE 044408

KARNOW SAYS DILEMMA FOR PRES IS THAT THIS MISPERCEPTION
HAS BECOME &quot;REALITY THAT HE CANNOT EVADE.&quot; CARTER CANNOT
BEGIN LOBBY ON CAPITOL FOR CHANGE IN RELATIONSHIP SO LONG
AS STRUGGLING TO WIN APPROVAL PANAMA CANAL TREATY/SALT/
MIDDLE EAST ISSUES. FOR WOODCOCK TO PROD PRES NOW IS
&quot;DISSERVICE,&quot; SIGNALS PRC THAT US AMB, WHO IS SUPPOSED TO
BE &quot;TOUGH NEGOTIATOR,&quot; IS PREPARED CONCLUDE DEAL W/O
BARGAINING FOR SOMETHING IN EXCHANGE. SAYS WOODCOCK'S
ACTIONS EXAMPLE OF &quot;CLIENTISM&quot;--WHEN ENVOY BEGINS REPRESENT
COUNTRY ASSIGNED TO RATHER THAN US--AND ALSO ANOTHER
EXAMPLE OF &quot;AMATUERISM,&quot; WHICH &quot;HAS BECOME ALL TOO
CHARACTERISTIC&quot; OF CARTER ADMIN'S CONDUCT ABROAD.
COMPANION ITEM BY THOMAS THOMPSON (POL SCI PROF AT UNIV
OF OREGON) STATES NORMALIZATION US/PRC RELATIONS URGENT/
&quot;UNFORTUNATE SITUATION&quot; THAT PANAMA, SALT,MIDEAST HAVE
MADE CHINA POLICY LOW PRIORITY FOR ADMIN. SAYS BEFORE
LONG, PRC WILL ACQUIRE MIL POWER TO CONQUER ROC, SO IN
ANTICIPATION OF THAT CAPABILITY, NORMALIZATION SHOULD BE
NEGOTIATED. NOTES SOME USG ANALYSTS FEAR NORMALIZATION

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
MIGHT FORCE ROC ENHANCE OWN DEFENSES BY SEEKING SOVIET
ARMS OR EMBARKING ON CRASH NUKE DEFENSE PROGRAM--AND THAT
PRC REACTION TO THIS WOULD BE FORCEFUL.
THOMPSON SAYS THIS CRISIS SCENARIO IS ONE OF BEST REASONS
OF ALL FOR SPEEDY NORMALIZATION, AS THAT AGREEMENT WOULD
ALSO CONTAIN UNDERSTANDING ON TAIWAN ISSUE. CONCLUDES
CARTER HAS IMMEDIATE OBLIGATION REDUCE CHANCE OF US/PRC
CONFLICT, AND THIS CAN ONLY BE DONE THRU ESTABLISHING
DIPLO RELS.
MICHAEL LINDSAY (PROF EMERITUS, AMERICAN UNIV),
CASTIGATES US &quot;LOW POSTURE&quot; APPROACH TO CHINA. CITES USG'S
SEEMING RELUCTANCE SAY ANYTHING THAT WOULD GIVE OFFENSE
UNCLASSIFIED
PAGE 14

STATE 044408

TO CHINESE, PARTICULARLY VIS-A-VIS TAIWAN, AND IN PROCESS,
SUGGESTS US PREPARED GRANT CONSIDERABLE CONCESSIONS IN
ORDER ATTAIN NORMALIZATION RAPIDLY. SAYS WOODCOCK'S
RECENT COMMENTS INDICATE &quot;LOW POSTURE APPROACH&quot; STILL IN
EFFECT.
LINDSAY SUGGESTS IF US WERE TO ABANDON ROC TO WIN PEKING'S
FAVOR, THIS WOULD GIVE CHINESE LEADERS CAUSE SUSPECT THAT
US WOULD HAVE EVEN LESS SCRUPLES ABOUT ABANDONING THEM IF
IT SEEMED EXPEDIENT TO WIN SOVIET FAVOR. FURTHER SUGGESTS
IF WOODCOCK COULD REASON CLEARLY AS CHINESE, HE MIGHT
SUSPECT THAT PRC LEADERS INSISTENT ON TAIWAN ISSUE BECAUSE
THEY WANT SOMETHING THEY CAN ONLY GET FROM US BEFORE
SEEKING DETENTE W/SOVIETS (WP).
TINLEY AKAR, INFO OFFICER IN NYC &quot;OFFICE OF TIBET&quot;
(NYT 2/18), DECRIES FACT THAT TIBETANS WHO BECAME
CITIZENS OF US/CANADA MUST HAVE CHINA, RATHER THAN TIBET,
AS COUNTRY OF BIRTH ON PASSPORTS. OBSERVES MOST TIBETANS
WHO APPLIED FOR PASSPORTS WERE BORN IN TIBET IN '40S WHEN
IT WAS DE FACTO/DE JURE INDEPENDENT NATION.
AKAR SAYS CHINESE VERY SENSITIVE ABOUT TIBET ISSUE &quot;BECAUSE
OF THEIR INSECURITY AND TIBETAN RESISTANCE TO CHINESE
RULE.&quot; THUS US/CANADA FEAR HOSTILE CHINESE
REPERCUSSIONS, SO 2 COUNTRIES TAKE EVERY PRECAUTION TO
AVOID OFFENDING &quot;SHORT-TEMPERED&quot; PEKING REGIME.
BUTTERFIELD (NYT HK 2/20) OBSERVES RECENT FLURRY PRC
FON ACTIVITY: TENG VISITS TO BURMA/NEPAL; SIGNING BY PRC
OF TRADE AGREEMENTS W/EC AND JAPAN--UNDERSCORES NEW
DIRECTION FON POLICY THAT NEW LEADERSHIP HAS BEGUN UNDERTAKE. THIS POLICY, BUTTERFIELD SAYS, IS &quot;REALISTIC&quot;/

&quot;OUTWARD-LOOKING,&quot; PRAGMATICALLY DESIGNED SPEED CHINA'S
DEVELOPMENT. WHILE PEKING STILL INSISTS ITS POLICY
IS ONLY EXTENSION OF MAO'S IDEALS, BUTTERFIELD SUGGESTS,
SUCCESSORS HAVE PUSHED MAO PRINCIPLES SO FAR THAT BECOME
OPEN QUESTION WHETHER THEY HAVE TRANSFORMED THEM INTO
NEW APPROACH.
ON ANOTHER TOPIC, BUTTERFIELD OBSERVES PEKING HAS
RECONCILED SELF TO SLOWNESS OF US MOVEMENT TOWARD
NORMALIZATION. NOTES IN SECRET SPEECH GIVEN LAST SUMMER,
FONMIN HUANG HUA ALLEGED TO HAVE TOLD OFFICIALS THAT
PEKING NOT SATISFIED W/WASHINGTON'S PERFORMANCE BUT THAT
IT ACCEPTED THAT THERE WOULD BE NO NORMALIZATION FOR
1-2 YRS. IN ANOTHER DISCLOSURE, HUANG SAID THAT WASHINGTON
SHOULD BE TOLD THAT EVEN AFTER IT BROKE RELS W/ROC, PRC
&quot;WILL NOT W/IN NEXT DECADE USE FORCE TO LIBERATE TAIWAN.&quot;
