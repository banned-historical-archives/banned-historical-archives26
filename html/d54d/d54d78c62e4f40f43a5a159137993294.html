		<h3>Tor</h3>
		<p><a href="https://www.torproject.org">Tor</a> is an encrypted anonymising network that makes it harder to intercept internet communications, or see where communications are coming from or going to.</p>
		<p>In order to use the WikiLeaks public submission system as detailed above you can download the Tor Browser Bundle, which is a Firefox-like browser available for Windows, Mac OS X and GNU/Linux and pre-configured to connect using the anonymising system Tor.</p>
		<h4>Tails</h4>
		<p>If you are at high risk and you have the capacity to do so, you can also access the submission system through a secure operating system called <a href="https://tails.boum.org">Tails</a>. Tails is an operating system launched from a USB stick or a DVD that aim to leaves no traces when the computer is shut down after use and automatically routes your internet traffic through Tor. Tails will require you to have either a USB stick or a DVD at least 4GB big and a laptop or desktop computer.</p>

		<h3>Tips</h3>
		<p>Our submission system works hard to preserve your anonymity, but we recommend you also take some of your own precautions. Please review these basic guidelines. </p>
		<div>
			<h4>1. Contact us if you have specific problems</h4>
			<p>If you have a very large submission, or a submission with a complex format, or are a high-risk source, please <a href="#submit_help_contact">contact us</a>. In our experience it is always possible to find a custom solution for even the most seemingly difficult situations.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h4>2. What computer to use</h4>
			<p>If the computer you are uploading from could subsequently be audited in an investigation, consider using a computer that is not easily tied to you. Technical users can also use <a href="https://tails.boum.org">Tails</a> to help ensure you do not leave any records of your submission on the computer.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h4>3. Do not talk about your submission to others</h4>
			<p>If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in source protection – it is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This includes other media organisations.</p>
		</div>

	</div>

		<h3>After</h3>

		<div>
			<h4>1. Do not talk about your submission to others</h4>
			<p>If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in source protection – it is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This includes other media organisations.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h4>2. Act normal</h4>
			<p>If you are a high-risk source, avoid saying anything or doing anything after submitting which might promote suspicion. In particular, you should try to stick to your normal routine and behaviour.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h4>3. Remove traces of your submission</h4>
			<p>If you are a high-risk source and the computer you prepared your submission on, or uploaded it from, could subsequently be audited in an investigation, we recommend that you format and dispose of the computer hard drive and any other storage media you used.</p>
			<p>In particular, hard drives retain data after formatting which may be visible to a digital forensics team and flash media (USB sticks, memory cards and SSD drives) retain data even after a secure erasure. If you used flash media to store sensitive data, it is important to destroy the media.</p>
			<p>If you do this and are a high-risk source you should make sure there are no traces of the clean-up, since such traces themselves may draw suspicion.</p>
			<div>
				<h4>4. If you face legal action</h4>
				<p>If a legal action is brought against you as a result of your submission, there are organisations that may help you. The Courage Foundation is an international organisation dedicated to the protection of journalistic sources. You can find more details at <a href="https://www.couragefound.org">https://www.couragefound.org</a>.</p>

		<p>WikiLeaks publishes documents of political or historical importance that are censored or otherwise suppressed. We specialise in strategic global publishing and large archives.</p>
		<p>The following is the address of our secure site where you can anonymously upload your documents to WikiLeaks editors. You can only access this submissions system through Tor. (See our <a href="#submit_help_tor">Tor tab</a> for more information.) We also advise you to read our <a href="#submit_help_tips">tips for sources</a> before submitting.</p>

			<!--<div>
				Copy this address into your Tor browser. Advanced users, if they wish, can also add a further layer of encryption to their submission using <a href="#submit_wlkey">our public PGP key</a>.
			</div>-->
		</div>

		<p>If you cannot use Tor, or your submission is very large, or you have specific requirements, WikiLeaks provides several alternative methods. <a href="#submit_help_contact">Contact us</a> to discuss how to proceed.</p>

SUBJ: TRANSCRIPT OF CODEL WOLFF MEETING WITH TENG HSIAO PING
A DELEGATION CONSISTING OF SEVEN CONGRESSMEN
HEADED BY CONGRESSMAN WOLFF MET WITH VICE PREMIER
TENG HSIAO-PING FOR 90 MINUTES JULY 9 AT THE GREAT
HALL OF THE PEOPLE. THE MEETING WAS ALSO ATTENDED
BY HAO TE-CHING, PRESIDENT OF THE CHINESE PEOPLE'S
INSTITUTE FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS (CPIFA), VICE FOREIGN
MINSTER WANG HAI-JUNG, CPIFA OFFICIALS HSIEH LI AND
FAN KUO-HSIANG, MFA AMERICAN AND OCEANIAN AFFAIRS
DEPUTY DIRECTOR CHU CHI-CHEN, AND AMBASSADOR WOODCOCK.
THE TRANSCRIPT WHICH FOLLOWS HAS BEEN SEEN IN DRAFT
BY CONGRESSMAN WOLFF.
TENG: I BELIEEVE YOU HAVE ALREADY COME ONCE TO
CHINA IN 1976.
WOLFF: YES, CONGRESSMAN BURKE AND I CAME AT THAT TIME.
TENG: IS IT THE FIRST VISIT FOR THE OTHERS?
WOLFF: YES, IT IS.
TENG: YOU WERE FORTUNATE AT THAT TIME TO MEET ONE OF
THE MOST NOTORIOUS PERSONS IN CHINA - CHANG CHUN-CHIAO.
WOLFF: I THINK IT WAS IN THIS VERY ROOM.
TENG: CHANG CHUN-CHIAO WAS SUCH A REMARKABLE PERSON

THAT THE GANG OF FOUR CREATED A CHANG CHUN-CHIAO
THEORY TO REPLACE MAO TSE-TUNG THOUGHT.
WOLFF: AFTER HAVING MET CHANG CHUN-CHIAO WE NEVER
THOUGHT THAT WE WOULD HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO MEET
YOU.
TENG: I AM A NEWSMAKER. IT IS A PITY THAT YOU ARE
NOT GOING TO MEET AS FAMOUS A PERSON AS CHANG CHUN-

CHIAO, ONLY AN OLD SOLDIER. I SPENT HALF OF MY LIFE
IN WAR.
WOLFF: THERE IS TOO MUCH WAR IN THE WORLD.
TENG: WE FOUGHT FOR ABOUT 22 YEARS. IN THE END WE
FOUNDED THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA. HAVE YOU HAD
A PLEASANT STAY HERE IN CHINA?
WOLFF: YES, VERY MUCH SO. ON BEHALF OF MY COLLEAGUES
I WOULD LIKE TO THANK YOU FOR THE VERY PLEASANT
RECEPTION WE HAVE BEEN GIVEN BY THE OFFICIALS OF YOUR
COUNTRY.I THINK I HAVE NOTICED A CHANGE IN RELATIONS
BETWEEN OUR TWO COUNTRIES SINCE MY LAST VISIT HERE.
TENG: IT IS A GREAT PLEASURE FOR ME TO HAVE THE
OPPORTUNITY TO MEET YOU. IT DOES NOT MATTER IF WE
DIFFER ON CERTAIN MATTERS DURING OUR EXCHANGE OF
VIEWS. SOME MUTUAL UNDERSTANDING BETWEEN US IS
BETTER THAN NO UNDERSTANDING AT ALL. IN 1975 WHEN
I WAS IN CHARGE OF THE DAY TO DAY WORK OF THE GOVERNMENT I MET MANY AMERICAN FRIENDS. AMONG THEM WERE
MANY US CONGRESSMEN. I ALSO RECEIVED DR. KISSINGER
AND PRESIDENT FORD. I ALSO MET MR. NIXON WHO IS VERY
MUCH DISCREDITED IN THE US BUT WILL BE REMEMBERED
BY THE CHINESE PEOPLE. IN THE PRESENT CIRCUMSTANCES
WE FACE THE SAME PROBLEMS. IT IS IMPORTANT TO ENHACNE
OUR MUTUAL UNDERSTANDING AND TO SEEK THE BASIS FOR OUR
COMMON EFFORTS. WE ARE READY TO LISTEN TO THE
DIFFERENT VIEWS AND IDEAS OF AMERICAN POLITICIANS.

AS YOU KNOW, WE ALSO PREFER TO SPEAK OUR MINDS
CANDIDLY. YOU KNOW THAT I AM AN OLD SOLDIER. I
BELIEVE THAT MANY OF YOU HAVE ALSO BEEN SOLDIERS.
WOLFF: I AM STILL A FLYER.
TENG: REALLY? YOU ARE IN YOUR 60S AND CAN STILL FLY?
WOLFF: OH, YES.
TENG: THEN YOU ARE IN VERY GOOD HEALTH. I BELIEVE
SOME OF THE OTHERS WERE ALSO SOLDIERS.
RANGEL: SOME OF US PREFER TO FORGET OUR MILITARY
EXPERIENCES, SUCH AS IN KOREA.
TENG: I DON'T THINK YOU SHOULD FORGET COMPLETELY.
ANGEL: THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.
TENG: IT IS BETTER TO FORGET CERTAIN MATTERS LIKE THE
ADVVANCE OF US TROOPS TO THE YALU RIVER. THESE
MATTERS ARE BETTER TO FORGET. BUT THE MILITARY
QUESTION IS STILL A VERY REAL ONE. I WILL BE
PLEASED TO HEAR WORDS OF WISDOM FROM ALL OF YOU, SO WE
CAN EXCHANGE OUR VIEWS FREELY.
WOLFF. WE ARE NOT WISE MEN, ONLY REPRESENTATIVES OF
THE PEOPLE. PERHAPS WE CAN ECHO THE VIEWS OF OUR
PEOPLE. WE CAME HERE TO FIND WAYS AND MEANS OF HOW
WE AS NATIONS AND PEOPLE CAN COME TOGETHER.

AMBASSADOR HAO AND I HAD A LONG DISCUSSION THE OTHER
DAY ABOUT THE AREAS WHERE WE HAVE DIFFERENCES AND
AREAS WHERE WE CAN COME TOGETHER. I THINK THERE ARE
MANY MORE THINGS THAT WE AGREE UPON THAN THERE ARE
AREAS OF DISAGREEMENT. I WOULD LIKE TO ASK, IF THE
VICE PREMIER WOULD CARE TO COMMENT: WHEN SECRETARY
VANCE WAS HERE AND HELD DISCUSSIONS, AFTERWARDS THERE
WERE INDICATIONS THAT SOME MATTERS WERE NOT SATISFACTORY TO THE VICE PREMIER. THE RECENT VISIT BY
DR. BRZEZINSKI, HOWEVER, WAS GREETED WITH APPROBATION BY YOUR GOVERNMENT. DO YOU THINK THAT THE
BRZEZINSKI VISIT REPRESENTED PROGRESS IN OUR RELATIONS WHICH EXCEEDED THAT OF THE VISIT BY SECRETARY
VANCE? WHAT ARE THE AREAS WE CAN PURSUE MORE CLOSELY

AS A RESULT OF THE BRZEZINSKI VISIT?
TENG: I CAN TELLYOU THAT WE EXPRESSED OUR CONSISTENT
VIEWS TO BOTH VANCE AND BRZEZINSKI. I ALSO NOTICED
THAT THE VIEWS OF THE USG EXPRESSED BY MR. VANCE
AND DR. BRZEZINSKI ARE THE SAME. THAT IS, THE US
IS COMMITTED TO NORMALIZATION OF RELATIONS WITH THE
FRAMEWORK OF THE PRINCIPLES OF THE SHANGHAI COMMUNIQUE.
THE RESULT OF BOTH TALKS IS THE SAME, NAMELY, THAT
BOTH SIDES CWILL CONTINUE TO MAKE EFFORTS TOWARD THIS
END, BUT THERE WAS NO SUBSTANTIAL RESULT FROM THE

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
VISITS. MY IMPRESSION MAY NOT BE CORRECT BECAUSE
THEY TOOK PLACE SOME MONTHS AGO -- YOU CAN CONFIRM
THIS AND TELL US WHETHER THE USGOVERNMENT IS NOW
MORE ACTIVE IN THIS RESPECT. WE WILL WELCOME MORE
ACTIVE EFFORTS ON THE PART OF THE USG. AS TO WHAT
WILL ACTUALLY HAPPEN, THAT DEPENDS ON THE EFFORTS OF
BOTH SIDES. AS FOR THE CHINESE SIDE, WE WILL WATCH
TO SEE WHAT ACTION THE U TAKES. THE ONLY DIFFERENCE IS WHAT WE CALL A SMALL ELEMENT. AS I SAID
EARLIER, WE EXPLAINED THE SAME VIEWS TO SECRETARY
VANCE, BUT THEN AFTERWARDS WHEN HE WAS IN TOKYO HE
STATED THAT CHINA HAD RELAXED ITS POSITION ON THIS
QUESTION, THAT THERE WAS SOME FLEXIBILITY ON CHINA'S
SIDE. THIS IS THE ONLY DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE
TWO VISITS AND IT ISGONE. WE ALSO HAD VERY GOOD TALKS

WITH SECRETARY VANCE BECAUSE WE SHARE THE SAME DESIRES.
AS YOU STATED, OUR TWO SIDES SHARE MANY AREAS IN
COMMON. TO BE EXACT, HOW TO COPE WITH THE POLAR
BEAR. THERE ARE MANY COMMON EFFORTS THAT WE CAN MAKE
AND WE CAN COORDINATE IN MANY WAYS. THE DIFFERENCE
AND THE OBSTCLE TO NORMALIZATION IS THE QUESTION OF
TAIWAN. I THINK WE CAN SIT DOWN TOGETHER AND TALK
THIS QUESTION OUT. OUR POSITION IS CLEAR-CUT. THIS
IS A AMTTER WHICH CONCERNS THE REUNIFICATION OF A
COUNTRY AND ALSO INVOLVEDS STATE SOVEREIGNTY. ON SUCH
MATTERS THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT CANNOT GO AGAINST THE
WILL OF THE CHINESE PEOPLE. I DON'T KNOWWHETHER WE
CAN DRAW THE CONCLUSION THAT THE USG COMPOSED OF SUCH
PEOPLE AS VANCE AND BRZEZINSKI IS NOW MORE ACTIVE ON
THE QUESTION OF NORMALIZATION. WE HOPE IT WILL BE
MORE ACTIVE. I BELIEVE WE AS WELL AS YOU WILL HAVE
A MORE ACTIVE ATTITUDE TOWARD SETTLING THE QUESTION
OF NORMALIZATION OF RELATIONS. THRE ISS A NEED
FOR THIS BECAUSE THERE ARE COMPELLING CIRCUMSTANCES.
THE SOVIETS ARE TAKING NAKED ACTION AROUND THE WORLD.
THE INTERNATIONAL SITUATION IN RECENT MONTHS IS QUITE
DIFFERENT FROM THAT OF SEVERAL MONTHS AGO. THERE ARE
THE QUESTIONS OF TEHIOPIA, ZAIRE, SOUTH YEMEN,
AFGHANISTAN AND VIETNAM. ALL OF THESE POSE PROBLEMS
TO US AND I THINK ALSO TO YOU.
WOLFF: BOTH OF US.

DR. BRZEZINSKI AND SECRETARY VANCE WILL TAKE A MORE
ACTIVE ATTITUDE ON THIS MATTER. WE HAVE THIS DESIRE
AND WE HOPE YOU CAN BE QUICKER. IN OUR EARNEST
EFFORTS TO COPE WITH THE POLAR BEAR IN OUR GLOBAL
TRATEGY, NORMALIZATION IS A VERY IMPORTANT STEP AND
SO IS THE TREATY OF PEACE AND FRIENDSHIP WITH JAPAN.
WHEN FOREIGN MINISTER HUANG HUA MET MR. VANCE HE GAVE
A MESSAGE FROM PREMIER HUA KUO-FENG TO PRESIDENT
CARTER IN THIS REGARD. MR HUANG ORIGINALLY INTENDED
TO MEET PRESIDENT CARTER WHEN HE WAS IN NEW YORK BUT
THERE WAS NO TIME. THE MESSAGE IS THAT NORMALIZATION
IS NOT A QUESTION OF DIPLOMACY BUT A POLITICAL
QUESTION. WE STILL HOLD THIS VIEW. WE MUST LOOK
AT AND HANDLE THIS QUESTION IN LIGHT OF THE OVERALL
INTERNATIONAL SITUATION AND IN A STRATEGIC PERSPECTIVE.
WOLFF: I WONDER IF YOU COUL TELL US HOW YOU DISTINGUISH
BETWEEN POLLITICAL AND DIPLOMATIC. DOES IT MEAN THAT
WE CAN PROCEED IMEDIATELY TO POLITICAL NORMALIZATION
AND PERMIT DIPLOMATIC NORMALIZATION TO PROCEED AT ITS
OWN PACE?
TENG: IN DIPLOMACY THERE IS A LOT OF EMPTY TALK.
THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS TO TAKE ACTUAL ACTION.
HAVE YOU EVER BEEN A DIPLOMAT?
WOLFF: YOU KNOW I AM NOT A DIPLOMAT.
TENG: I THINK THERE ARE ONLY TWO DIPLOMATS PRESENT
IN THE ROOM.
WOLFF: I WOULD PUT AMBASSADOR WOODCOCK ABOVE THE
LEVEL OF A DIPLOMAT.
TENG: I AGREE. I HAVE MET HIM MANY TIMES. I
DIDN'T MEAN TO SAY THAT THERE SHOULD BE NO DIPLOMATS
BUT I THINK THAT A GOOD DIPLOMAT IS ALSO A GOOD
POLITICIAN.
WOLFF: MR. VICE PREMIER, THERE IS A QUESTION THAT TROUBLES MANY OF US.
IT IS THE FACT THAT WE HAVE
MANY AREAS IN COMMON BUT WE STILL HAVE NO DIPLOMATIC

TENG: THE THING THAT THE RUSSIANS FEAR THE MOST IS
NORMALIZATION OF (CHINESE) RELATIONS WITH THE US AND
THE CONCLUSION OF THE TREATY OF PEACE AND FRIENDSHIP
WITH JAPAN. THEY ARE DOING THEIR UTMOST TO OBSTRUCT
THESE TWO THINGS. I THINK THAT IT IS EASIER TO COME
TO AN AGREEMENT AND TO TAKE THE SAME STEPS IF WE LOOK
TO AN AGREEMENT AND TO TAKE THE SAME STEPS IF WE LOOK
AT THE QUESTION FROM THE POLITICAL AND STRATEGIC POINT
OF VIEW. THE ONLY OBSTCLE BETWEEN US IS THE ISSUE OF
TAIWAN. I WANT TO BE CANDID WITH OUR AMERICAN FRIENDS
AND TO SAY THAT ON THIS ISSUE THERE CAN BE NO CONCESSION SINCE THIS INVOLVES OUR OWN SOVEREIGNTY.
AS FOR THE SPECIFIC MODALITIES WE CAN CONSULT EACH
OTHER ON THESE MATTERS, BUT ON MATTERS OFPRINCIPLE
WE MUST ABIDE BY THE THREE CONDITIONS FOR NORMALIZATION. THERE IS NO ROOM FOR FLEXIBILITY. IT IS
IMPOSSIBLE FOR US TO RELAX OUR POSITION IN THIS
REGARD.

THE INTERNAL AFFAIRS OF YOUR COUNTRY AND WE DO NOT WANT
TO INTERFERE IN A SETTLLEMENT BETWEEN THE PEOPLE IN
TAIWAN AND YOUR GOVERNMENT. HOWEVER, THERE ARE CERTAIN
CONSIDERATIONS WHICH WE HAVE HELD OVER THE YEARS. YOU
SAID THAT WE SHOULD BE FRANK. SOME HAVE SUGGESTED
USING THE JAPANESE FORMULA. BUT THIS IS NOT A FRANK
SOLUTIOUN TO THE ISSUE. IT IS ONLY COSMETIC AND DOES
NOT REALLY SOLVE THE PROBLEM. IT IS HARDLY AN
ACCEPTABLE SOLUTION OVER THE LONG RUN. MERELY TO SAY
THAT WE HAVE A LEGATION OR A TRADE OFFICE THAT HAS A
SEPARATE FUNCTION -- THAT IS NOT ENOUGH. THE OLUTION
MUST GO BEYOND THE QUESTION OF THE NAMES WE ATTACH TO
VARIOUS OFFICES. AS THE VICE PREMIER HAS SAID, THERE
ARE SERIOUS WORLD PROBLEMS WHICH CONFRONT US. WE
NEED TO AGREE ON THE SPECIFICS OF JOINT ACTIONS THAT
WE CAN TAKE TOGETHER, NOT ONLY TAIWAN BUT IN COPING
WITH THE CHALLENGES OF THE SOVIET UNION. THIS IS
IMPORTANT FOR THE US AN FOR THE WORLD. THERE IS AN
EXPRESSION IN THE US: &quot;YOU SHOULD NEVER LET A SMALL
FLY SPOIL A WHOLE BOWL OF SOUP.&quot; WE SHOULD NOT LET
THIS ONE SMALL FLY SPOIL OUR BOWL OF SOUP.
TENG: UNFORTUNATELY, THE QUESTION IS NOT SUCH A SMALL
FLY. IT IS MUCH BIGGER THAN THAT. FRANKLY, WHEN WE
SAY THAT WE AGREE TO THE JAPANESE FORMJLA WE ARE
ALREADY MAKING A VERY BIG CONCESSION. BY THE SOCALLED JAPANESE FORMULA, AFTER YOU ABROGATE THE
TREATY WITH TAIWAN, WITHDRAW MILITARY FORCES AND
SEVER YOUR DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS YOU CAN STILL
MAINTAIN NONGOVERNMENTAL CONTACTS IN TAIWAN AS THE
JAPANESE DO. THIS WILL NOT AFFECT THE INTERESTS OF
THE US. ON THE OTHER HAND, IF YOU LOOK AT THE QUESTION FROM THE POLITICAL AND STRATEGIC POINT OF VIEW
IT IS IN THE GREAT INTEREST OF US BOTH IN DEALING

DO YOU HAVE ANY DIRECT CONTACTS WITH THE PEOPLE OF

TOGETHER THEMSELVES AND NOT DEPEND ON THE ATTITUDE OF
THE US?
TENG: IF THE US WITHDRAWAS FROM TAIWAN THEN WE CAN
SETTLE THE QUESTION OURSELVES IN OUR OWN WAYS. IN OUR
HISTORY THEREHAS TWICE BEEN COOPERATION BETWEEN THE
KUOMINTANG AND THE CHINESE COMMUNIST PARTY. THE
FIRST TIME WAS IN THE NORTHERN EXPEDITION WHEN SUN
YAT-SEN COOPERATED WITH THE COMMUNIST PARTY. THE
SECOND PERIOD OF COOPERATION TOOK PLACE WHEN JAPAN
INVADED CHINA. EVEN AT THAT TIME THE TWO PARTIES WERE
VERY HOSTILE TO EACH OTHER. THIS SHOWED THAT WHEN
CONFRONTED WITH THE SAME NATIONAL PROBLEM THE
CHINESE PEOPLE CAN DEAL WITH IT. SINCE THERE HAS
ALREADY BEEN COOPERATION TWICE WITH THE KUOMINTANG,
CAN YOU RULE IT OUT THE THIRD TIME? WE HAVE OFTEN
SAID TO AMERICANS THAT IN OUR EFFORTS TO SETTLE THE
TAIWAN ISSUE AND TO REUNIFY THE MOTHERLAND WE WILL
RESPECT REALITIES AND WE CAN BE FLEXIBLE IN THE
MEANS OF SETTLEMENT. GIVEN THIS ATTITUDE I AM SURE
THAT IT WILL BE POSSIBLE TO FIND A SETTLEMENT
SATISFACTORY TO ALL.

THAT THAT IS A VERY ENCOURAGING STATEMENT.

UNION MUST BE MUCH MORE CAUTIOUS STRATEGICALLY.
SOME PEOPLE SAY THAT CHINA IS BEING PLAYED AS A PAWN.
OF COURSE, CHINA WOULDN'T LIKE
TO BE A PAWN. BUT THE SOVIET UNION WANTS TO SEPARATE
CHINA FROM THE US BECAUSE THIS MAKES IT EASIER FOR
THE SOVIETS TO DEAL WITH YOU AND WITH EUROPE AND WITH
JAPAN. YOU SHOULD NOT ONLY REMEMBER THAT THE SOVIET
UNION IS ACCUSING CHINA VISIOUSLY EVERY DAY. THE
SOVIETS ALSO WANT THE APPEAREANCE OF CONCILIATION WITH
US SO AS TO BLUFF YOU. I WON'T GO INTO THE DETAILS
BUT MANY TACTICS ARE EMPLOYED. BUT WE KNOW THEIR
INTENTIONS SO WE JUST IGNORE THEM. THE SOVIET UNION

ALL AMERICAN POLITICIANS, INCLUDING YOU WHO ARE CONCERNED WITH GLOBAL QUESTIONS, ESPECIALLY IN THE ASIA AND
PACIFIC REGION, I HOPE YOU REALIZE HOW IMPORTANT
NORMAL RELATIONS ARE BETWEEN OUR TWO COUNTRIES, ESPECIALLY
AFTER WHAT HAS HAPPENED RECENTLY IN AFGHANISTAN
AND VIETNAM. I HOPE YOU WILL PONDER THIS QUESTION
CAREFULLY. SINCE YOU STUDY PROBLEMS OF THE ASIA AND
PACIFIC REGION YOU KNOW THE ROLE OF THE REGION IN
SOVIET STRATEGY. THE SOVIET DESIRE IS TO ESTABLISH
A COLLECTIVE SECURITY SYSTEM IN ASIA. IT WANTS TO
INCLUDE THE WHOLE REGION IN ITS ORBIT. WE HAVE
OPPOSED THIS SCHEME. NO ASIAN COUNTRY, INCLUDING
INDIA, DESIRES TO ACCEPT THIS PROPOSAL FOR A COLLECTIVE

SECURITY SYSTEM BECAUSE THE SOVIETS' INTENTION IS
VERY CLEAR. NOW THE SOVIET UNION IS USING VIETNAM
AS ITS PAW TO SNEAK INTO ASEAN IN ORDER TO REALIZE THE
OBJECTIVE OF ESTABLISHING A COLLECTIVE SECURITY SYSTEM
IN ASIA. THE ASEAN COKNTRIES ARE AWARE OF THIS
OBJECTIVE. VIETNAM HAS STATED ITS INTENTION TO
JOIN ASEAN, WITH CONDITIONS ATTACHED. RECENTLY IT
DROPPED THESE CONDITIONS BECAUSE IT IS BENT ON SNEAKING
INTO THE ORGANIZATION. THUS IT IS NOT ADVISABLE THAT
YOU KEEP YOUR EYES ONLY ON THE SITUATION IN AFRICA
AND THE MIDDLE EAST. THE RUSSIANS ARE ALSO QUICKENING
THEIR STEPS IN ASIA. IT IS NOT ONLY AFRICA AND THE
MIDDLEEAST WHERE THE SOVIET UNIONHAS TAKEN NAKED
ACTIONS BUT ALSO ASIA. SOVIET NAVAL AND AIR FORCES
POSE A THREAT TO JAPAN. PEOPLE MAY THINK THAT IT IS
MAINLY IN THE NORTHERN PART OFJAPAN THAT THE SOVIET
NAVAL AND AIR FORCES POSE A THREAT AND MAKE SHOWS OF
FORCE, AND THAT THE THREAT IS DIRECTED AGAINST
CHINA. IT MAY BE TERRIBLE BUT WE ARE NOT AFRAID.
THERE IS SOME TALK IN THE WORLD THAT THE SSOVIET UNION
IS ENCIRCLING CHINA, BUT CHINA IS NOT AFRAID OF
ENCIRCLEMENT. WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE HISTORY OF THE
CHINESE REVOUTIION WE HAVE GROWN IN PERIODS OF ENCIRCLEMENT AND HAVE BROKEN A LOT OF ENCIRCLEMENTS. THE
ESTABLISHMENT OF MILITARY BASES IN VIETNAM IS OF
COURSE DIRECTED AGAINST CHINA BUT IT IS DIRECTED ONLY
AGAINST CHINA? CAMRANH BAY IS QUITE A DISTANCE
FROM CHINA. IT CAN POSE NO REAL THREAT AGAINST CHINA EVEN
IF IT CAN CUT OFF COMMUNICATIONS, BUT THE THREAT IS
MUCH BIGGER AGAINST JAPAN, AGAINST SOUTHEAST ASIA
AND AGAINST OTHER ASIAN COUNTRIES.

EFFORTS TO COPE WITH THEM.
BURKE: I ACCEPT THE FACT THAT BOTH COUNTRIES ARE

REMAINS UNRESOLVED HOW LONG WILL IT BE BEFORE YOU
TAKE ACTION TO REUNIFY TAIWAN WITH CHINA. SECOND, IF

ARE THERE FOR THEM? AND THIRD, IF WE WITHDRAW OUR
COMMITMENTS WOUULDN'T THE ANTI-PRC PEOPLE NEGOTIATE
WITH THE SOVIET UNION AND THUS CREATE AN EVEN GREATER
PROBLEM FOR ALL OF US THANIF WE NEGOTIATE NORMALIZATION AND WORK OUT OUR DIFFERENCES LATER?
TENG: BY WITHDRAWAL OF THE US I REFER TO OUR THREE
CONDITIONS: THE WITHDRAWAL OF DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS,
THE WITHDRAWAL OF ALL MILITARY FORCES SAND INSTALLATIONS, AND BREAKING THE TREATY OFMUTUAL DEFENSE.
THEN THE US WILL HAVEPOLITICALLY WITHDRAWN FROM
TAIWAN AND THE CHINESE PEOPLE WILL BE LEFT TO SETTLE THE
ISSUE BY THEMSELVES. THE US CAN STILL MAINTAIN
UNOFFICIAL RELATIONS. THEN THE CHINESE PEOPLE WILL BE
LEFT TO SEETTLE THEIR OWN PROBLEMS BY THEMSELVES. YOU
REFERRED TO CERTAIN PEOPLE IN TAIWAN WHO ARE AGAINST
THE PRC. I THINK YOU ALSO NOTICED THE FACT THAT IT IS
STATED IN THE SHANGHAI COMMUNIQUE THAT ALL CHINESE
PEOPLE ON BOTH SIDES HOPE FOR REUNIFICATION. I SAID
ALREADY THAT THERE HAS TWICE BEEN COOPERATION BETWEEN
THE CHINESE COMMJNIST PARTY AND THE KUOMINTANG. LET
US SKIP OVER THE FIRST TIME AND LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT
THE SECOND WHICH TOOK PLACE AFTER TEN YEARS OF WAR
BETWEEN US. CHIANG KAI-SHEK HAD KILLED MILLIONS OF
CADRES AND PEOOLE BUT WHEN THE JAPANESE BEGAN THEIR
AGGRESSION WE CAME TOGETHER. OF COURSE, LATER WE
FELL APART AGAIN. THIS SHOWS THAT THERE MAY BE

SOLVE THE QUESTION E WILL FACE REALITIES. NOW THE
CRUX IS THAT SOME PEOPLE HOPE THAT CHINA WILL
UNDERTAKE A COMMITMENT NOT TO USE FORCE TO LIBERATE
TAIWAN. WE CANNOT COMMIT OURSELVES ON THIS QUESTION.
WE CANNOT UNDERTAKE THIS COMMITMENT BECAUSE IT IS A
MATTER INVOLVING SOVEREIGNTY. AS TO WHEN AND HOW WE
LIBERATE TAIWAN IT IS OUR INTERNAL AFFAIR AND NO OTHER
CUNTRY CAN POKE ITS NOSE INTO IT. SPEKING CANDIDLY,
IF THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT WERE TO UNDERTAKE THIS
COMMITMENT IT WOULD BLOCK THE WAY TO A SOLUTION OF THE
PROBLEM, INCLUDING A SOLUTION BY PEACEFUL MEANS.
RECENTLY THE U GOVERNMENT HAS TAKEN A MORE POSITIVE
SAND ON THIS QUESTION. IT WAS REPORTED THAT THE US
WOULDSELL SOME PLANES TO TAIWAN, THEN LATER IT WAS
REPORTED THAT YOU WOULD NOT SELL THE PLANES TO
TAIWAN. I THIK THIS IS VERY POSITIVE. IF SUCH AN
ACTION IS TAKEN IT WILL OBSTRUCT REUNIFICATION NEGOTIATIONS AND SETTLEMENT BY PEACEFUL MEANS. IF PEACEFUL
MEANS ARE IMPOSSIBLE THEN ARMED FORCE WILL HAVE TO BE
USED. BOTH CHIANG KAI-SHEK AND CHINAG CHING-KUO
WANTED TO REUNIFY THE COUNTRY THROUGH ARMED FORCE, TO
RECOVER THE MAINLAND BY ARMS. WE CANNOT UNDERTAKE
ANY COMMITMENT ASTO HOW TO ACHIEVE THE LIBERATION
OF TAIWAN, BUT WE WILL DO OUR BEST TO CREATE CONDITIONS TO SOLVE THIS QUESTION BY PEACEFUL MEANS.
SOME PEOPLE ARE WORRIED ABOUT SOVIET MEDDLING IN
TAIWAN. WE ARE NOT WORRIED. FIRST THERE IS THE
EXISTENCE OF THE PRC WITH A POPULATION OF 800 MILLION.
IF THE JAPANESE FORMULA IS FOLLOWED AND RELATIONS ARE
NORMALIZED BOTH JAPAN AND THE US WILL STILL MAINTAIN
NON-GOVERNMENTAL RELATIONS WITH TAIWAN. JUDGING
FROM THE HISTORICAL RECORD OF THE KUOMINTANG THEY WILL
NOT EASILY FALL INTO THE HANDS OF THE SOVIET UNION.
EVEN IF THIS HAPPENS WE HAVE WAYS TO COPE WITH THE
SITUATION. IF THERE WERE A SOVIET PRESENCE ON TAIWAN
AND WE USED FORCE I DON'T THINK THE US WOULD OPPOSE

I WOULD LIKE TO THANK YOU FOR THE VERY PLEASANT
RECEPTION WE HAVE BEEN GIVEN BY THE OFFICIALS OF YOUR
COUNTRY.I THINK I HAVE NOTICED A CHANGE IN RELATIONS
BETWEEN OUR TWO COUNTRIES SINCE MY LAST VISIT HERE.
TENG: IT IS A GREAT PLEASURE FOR ME TO HAVE THE
OPPORTUNITY TO MEET YOU. IT DOES NOT MATTER IF WE
DIFFER ON CERTAIN MATTERS DURING OUR EXCHANGE OF
VIEWS. SOME MUTUAL UNDERSTANDING BETWEEN US IS
BETTER THAN NO UNDERSTANDING AT ALL. IN 1975 WHEN
I WAS IN CHARGE OF THE DAY TO DAY WORK OF THE GOVERNMENT I MET MANY AMERICAN FRIENDS. AMONG THEM WERE
MANY US CONGRESSMEN. I ALSO RECEIVED DR. KISSINGER
AND PRESIDENT FORD. I ALSO MET MR. NIXON WHO IS VERY
MUCH DISCREDITED IN THE US BUT WILL BE REMEMBERED
BY THE CHINESE PEOPLE. IN THE PRESENT CIRCUMSTANCES
WE FACE THE SAME PROBLEMS. IT IS IMPORTANT TO ENHACNE

AS A RESULT OF THE BRZEZINSKI VISIT?
TENG: I CAN TELLYOU THAT WE EXPRESSED OUR CONSISTENT
VIEWS TO BOTH VANCE AND BRZEZINSKI. I ALSO NOTICED
THAT THE VIEWS OF THE USG EXPRESSED BY MR. VANCE
AND DR. BRZEZINSKI ARE THE SAME. THAT IS, THE US
IS COMMITTED TO NORMALIZATION OF RELATIONS WITH THE
FRAMEWORK OF THE PRINCIPLES OF THE SHANGHAI COMMUNIQUE.
THE RESULT OF BOTH TALKS IS THE SAME, NAMELY, THAT
BOTH SIDES CWILL CONTINUE TO MAKE EFFORTS TOWARD THIS
END, BUT THERE WAS NO SUBSTANTIAL RESULT FROM THE

VISITS. MY IMPRESSION MAY NOT BE CORRECT BECAUSE
THEY TOOK PLACE SOME MONTHS AGO -- YOU CAN CONFIRM
THIS AND TELL US WHETHER THE USGOVERNMENT IS NOW
MORE ACTIVE IN THIS RESPECT. WE WILL WELCOME MORE
ACTIVE EFFORTS ON THE PART OF THE USG. AS TO WHAT
WILL ACTUALLY HAPPEN, THAT DEPENDS ON THE EFFORTS OF
BOTH SIDES. AS FOR THE CHINESE SIDE, WE WILL WATCH
TO SEE WHAT ACTION THE U TAKES. THE ONLY DIFFERENCE IS WHAT WE CALL A SMALL ELEMENT. AS I SAID
EARLIER, WE EXPLAINED THE SAME VIEWS TO SECRETARY
VANCE, BUT THEN AFTERWARDS WHEN HE WAS IN TOKYO HE
STATED THAT CHINA HAD RELAXED ITS POSITION ON THIS
QUESTION, THAT THERE WAS SOME FLEXIBILITY ON CHINA'S
SIDE. THIS IS THE ONLY DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE
TWO VISITS AND IT ISGONE. WE ALSO HAD VERY GOOD TALKS

WITH SECRETARY VANCE BECAUSE WE SHARE THE SAME DESIRES.
AS YOU STATED, OUR TWO SIDES SHARE MANY AREAS IN
COMMON. TO BE EXACT, HOW TO COPE WITH THE POLAR
BEAR. THERE ARE MANY COMMON EFFORTS THAT WE CAN MAKE
AND WE CAN COORDINATE IN MANY WAYS. THE DIFFERENCE
AND THE OBSTCLE TO NORMALIZATION IS THE QUESTION OF
TAIWAN. I THINK WE CAN SIT DOWN TOGETHER AND TALK
THIS QUESTION OUT. OUR POSITION IS CLEAR-CUT. THIS
IS A AMTTER WHICH CONCERNS THE REUNIFICATION OF A
COUNTRY AND ALSO INVOLVEDS STATE SOVEREIGNTY. ON SUCH
MATTERS THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT CANNOT GO AGAINST THE
WILL OF THE CHINESE PEOPLE. I DON'T KNOWWHETHER WE
CAN DRAW THE CONCLUSION THAT THE USG COMPOSED OF SUCH
PEOPLE AS VANCE AND BRZEZINSKI IS NOW MORE ACTIVE ON
THE QUESTION OF NORMALIZATION. WE HOPE IT WILL BE
MORE ACTIVE. I BELIEVE WE AS WELL AS YOU WILL HAVE
A MORE ACTIVE ATTITUDE TOWARD SETTLING THE QUESTION
OF NORMALIZATION OF RELATIONS. THRE ISS A NEED
FOR THIS BECAUSE THERE ARE COMPELLING CIRCUMSTANCES.
THE SOVIETS ARE TAKING NAKED ACTION AROUND THE WORLD.
THE INTERNATIONAL SITUATION IN RECENT MONTHS IS QUITE
DIFFERENT FROM THAT OF SEVERAL MONTHS AGO. THERE ARE
THE QUESTIONS OF TEHIOPIA, ZAIRE, SOUTH YEMEN,
AFGHANISTAN AND VIETNAM. ALL OF THESE POSE PROBLEMS
TO US AND I THINK ALSO TO YOU.
WOLFF: BOTH OF US.
TENG: THE SOVIETS CONFRONT NOT ONLY OUR TWO COUNTRIES
BUT ALSO ALL OTHER COUNTRIES INCLUDING THOSE IN ASIA,
AFRICA AND EVEN LATIN AMERICA. IN LATIN AMERICA
THERE IS CUBA RIGHT UNDER YOUR NOSE.
WOLFF: WE KNOW.
TENG: I THINK YOU KNOW MUCH BETTER THAN I DO. I HOPE
THAT THE US GOVERNMENT, INCLUDING PRESIDENT CARTER,

DR. BRZEZINSKI AND SECRETARY VANCE WILL TAKE A MORE
ACTIVE ATTITUDE ON THIS MATTER. WE HAVE THIS DESIRE
AND WE HOPE YOU CAN BE QUICKER. IN OUR EARNEST
EFFORTS TO COPE WITH THE POLAR BEAR IN OUR GLOBAL
TRATEGY, NORMALIZATION IS A VERY IMPORTANT STEP AND
SO IS THE TREATY OF PEACE AND FRIENDSHIP WITH JAPAN.
WHEN FOREIGN MINISTER HUANG HUA MET MR. VANCE HE GAVE
A MESSAGE FROM PREMIER HUA KUO-FENG TO PRESIDENT
CARTER IN THIS REGARD. MR HUANG ORIGINALLY INTENDED
TO MEET PRESIDENT CARTER WHEN HE WAS IN NEW YORK BUT
THERE WAS NO TIME. THE MESSAGE IS THAT NORMALIZATION
IS NOT A QUESTION OF DIPLOMACY BUT A POLITICAL
QUESTION. WE STILL HOLD THIS VIEW. WE MUST LOOK
AT AND HANDLE THIS QUESTION IN LIGHT OF THE OVERALL
INTERNATIONAL SITUATION AND IN A STRATEGIC PERSPECTIVE.
WOLFF: I WONDER IF YOU COUL TELL US HOW YOU DISTINGUISH
BETWEEN POLLITICAL AND DIPLOMATIC. DOES IT MEAN THAT
WE CAN PROCEED IMEDIATELY TO POLITICAL NORMALIZATION
AND PERMIT DIPLOMATIC NORMALIZATION TO PROCEED AT ITS
OWN PACE?
TENG: IN DIPLOMACY THERE IS A LOT OF EMPTY TALK.
THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS TO TAKE ACTUAL ACTION.
HAVE YOU EVER BEEN A DIPLOMAT?
WOLFF: YOU KNOW I AM NOT A DIPLOMAT.
TENG: I THINK THERE ARE ONLY TWO DIPLOMATS PRESENT
IN THE ROOM.
WOLFF: I WOULD PUT AMBASSADOR WOODCOCK ABOVE THE
LEVEL OF A DIPLOMAT.
TENG: I AGREE. I HAVE MET HIM MANY TIMES. I
DIDN'T MEAN TO SAY THAT THERE SHOULD BE NO DIPLOMATS
BUT I THINK THAT A GOOD DIPLOMAT IS ALSO A GOOD
POLITICIAN.
WOLFF: MR. VICE PREMIER, THERE IS A QUESTION THAT TROUBLES MANY OF US.
IT IS THE FACT THAT WE HAVE
MANY AREAS IN COMMON BUT WE STILL HAVE NO DIPLOMATIC

HAVE YOU. HOW CAN WE RECONCILE THIS? WE ARE TWO

CONSIDER YOU A FRIEND.
TENG: THE THING THAT THE RUSSIANS FEAR THE MOST IS
NORMALIZATION OF (CHINESE) RELATIONS WITH THE US AND
THE CONCLUSION OF THE TREATY OF PEACE AND FRIENDSHIP
WITH JAPAN. THEY ARE DOING THEIR UTMOST TO OBSTRUCT
THESE TWO THINGS. I THINK THAT IT IS EASIER TO COME
TO AN AGREEMENT AND TO TAKE THE SAME STEPS IF WE LOOK
TO AN AGREEMENT AND TO TAKE THE SAME STEPS IF WE LOOK
AT THE QUESTION FROM THE POLITICAL AND STRATEGIC POINT
OF VIEW. THE ONLY OBSTCLE BETWEEN US IS THE ISSUE OF
TAIWAN. I WANT TO BE CANDID WITH OUR AMERICAN FRIENDS
AND TO SAY THAT ON THIS ISSUE THERE CAN BE NO CONCESSION SINCE THIS INVOLVES OUR OWN SOVEREIGNTY.
AS FOR THE SPECIFIC MODALITIES WE CAN CONSULT EACH
OTHER ON THESE MATTERS, BUT ON MATTERS OFPRINCIPLE
WE MUST ABIDE BY THE THREE CONDITIONS FOR NORMALIZATION. THERE IS NO ROOM FOR FLEXIBILITY. IT IS
IMPOSSIBLE FOR US TO RELAX OUR POSITION IN THIS
REGARD.

OUR GOVERNMENT ARE IN LINE WITH THE SHANGHAI
COMMUNIQUE. I DON'T THINK THAT VERY MUCH SEPARATES

THE INTERNAL AFFAIRS OF YOUR COUNTRY AND WE DO NOT WANT
TO INTERFERE IN A SETTLLEMENT BETWEEN THE PEOPLE IN
TAIWAN AND YOUR GOVERNMENT. HOWEVER, THERE ARE CERTAIN
CONSIDERATIONS WHICH WE HAVE HELD OVER THE YEARS. YOU
SAID THAT WE SHOULD BE FRANK. SOME HAVE SUGGESTED
USING THE JAPANESE FORMULA. BUT THIS IS NOT A FRANK
SOLUTIOUN TO THE ISSUE. IT IS ONLY COSMETIC AND DOES
NOT REALLY SOLVE THE PROBLEM. IT IS HARDLY AN
ACCEPTABLE SOLUTION OVER THE LONG RUN. MERELY TO SAY
THAT WE HAVE A LEGATION OR A TRADE OFFICE THAT HAS A
SEPARATE FUNCTION -- THAT IS NOT ENOUGH. THE OLUTION
MUST GO BEYOND THE QUESTION OF THE NAMES WE ATTACH TO
VARIOUS OFFICES. AS THE VICE PREMIER HAS SAID, THERE
ARE SERIOUS WORLD PROBLEMS WHICH CONFRONT US. WE
NEED TO AGREE ON THE SPECIFICS OF JOINT ACTIONS THAT
WE CAN TAKE TOGETHER, NOT ONLY TAIWAN BUT IN COPING
WITH THE CHALLENGES OF THE SOVIET UNION. THIS IS
IMPORTANT FOR THE US AN FOR THE WORLD. THERE IS AN
EXPRESSION IN THE US: &quot;YOU SHOULD NEVER LET A SMALL
FLY SPOIL A WHOLE BOWL OF SOUP.&quot; WE SHOULD NOT LET
THIS ONE SMALL FLY SPOIL OUR BOWL OF SOUP.
TENG: UNFORTUNATELY, THE QUESTION IS NOT SUCH A SMALL
FLY. IT IS MUCH BIGGER THAN THAT. FRANKLY, WHEN WE
SAY THAT WE AGREE TO THE JAPANESE FORMJLA WE ARE
ALREADY MAKING A VERY BIG CONCESSION. BY THE SOCALLED JAPANESE FORMULA, AFTER YOU ABROGATE THE
TREATY WITH TAIWAN, WITHDRAW MILITARY FORCES AND
SEVER YOUR DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS YOU CAN STILL
MAINTAIN NONGOVERNMENTAL CONTACTS IN TAIWAN AS THE
JAPANESE DO. THIS WILL NOT AFFECT THE INTERESTS OF
THE US. ON THE OTHER HAND, IF YOU LOOK AT THE QUESTION FROM THE POLITICAL AND STRATEGIC POINT OF VIEW
IT IS IN THE GREAT INTEREST OF US BOTH IN DEALING

DE LA GARZA: I WOULD LIKE TO ASK IF THERE IS ANY
EFFORT BEING MADE BY YOUR GOVERNMENT,ASIDE FROM THE
QUESTION OF RELATIONS WITH THE US, ANY EFFORT OF A
NONMILITARY NATURE TO UNIFY TAIWAN WITH THE MAINLAND.
DO YOU HAVE ANY DIRECT CONTACTS WITH THE PEOPLE OF
TAIWAN?
TENG: SO FAR THERE ARE NO OFFICIAL CONTACTS, BUT WE
KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE THERE. IN FACT, CHIANG CHING-KUO
WAS MY CLASSMATE.

AN INTERNAL QUESTION, BUT WOULDN'T IT BE EASIER IF

TOGETHER THEMSELVES AND NOT DEPEND ON THE ATTITUDE OF
THE US?
TENG: IF THE US WITHDRAWAS FROM TAIWAN THEN WE CAN
SETTLE THE QUESTION OURSELVES IN OUR OWN WAYS. IN OUR
HISTORY THEREHAS TWICE BEEN COOPERATION BETWEEN THE
KUOMINTANG AND THE CHINESE COMMUNIST PARTY. THE
FIRST TIME WAS IN THE NORTHERN EXPEDITION WHEN SUN
YAT-SEN COOPERATED WITH THE COMMUNIST PARTY. THE
SECOND PERIOD OF COOPERATION TOOK PLACE WHEN JAPAN
INVADED CHINA. EVEN AT THAT TIME THE TWO PARTIES WERE
VERY HOSTILE TO EACH OTHER. THIS SHOWED THAT WHEN
CONFRONTED WITH THE SAME NATIONAL PROBLEM THE
CHINESE PEOPLE CAN DEAL WITH IT. SINCE THERE HAS
ALREADY BEEN COOPERATION TWICE WITH THE KUOMINTANG,
CAN YOU RULE IT OUT THE THIRD TIME? WE HAVE OFTEN
SAID TO AMERICANS THAT IN OUR EFFORTS TO SETTLE THE
TAIWAN ISSUE AND TO REUNIFY THE MOTHERLAND WE WILL
RESPECT REALITIES AND WE CAN BE FLEXIBLE IN THE
MEANS OF SETTLEMENT. GIVEN THIS ATTITUDE I AM SURE
THAT IT WILL BE POSSIBLE TO FIND A SETTLEMENT
SATISFACTORY TO ALL.
WOLFF: I WOULD LIKE TO PRESENT ALL OF US BY SAYING
THAT THAT IS A VERY ENCOURAGING STATEMENT.

OF NORMALIZATION OF RELATIONS AND SIGNING OF A TREATY

THOUGH CHINA IS A POOR COUNTRY, FAIRLY BACKWARD IN

WE STILL HAVE OUR OWN STRENGTH. IF RELATIONS
BETWEEN OUR TWO COUNTRIES ARE NORMALIZED THE SOVIET
UNION MUST BE MUCH MORE CAUTIOUS STRATEGICALLY.
SOME PEOPLE SAY THAT CHINA IS BEING PLAYED AS A PAWN.
OF COURSE, CHINA WOULDN'T LIKE
TO BE A PAWN. BUT THE SOVIET UNION WANTS TO SEPARATE
CHINA FROM THE US BECAUSE THIS MAKES IT EASIER FOR
THE SOVIETS TO DEAL WITH YOU AND WITH EUROPE AND WITH
JAPAN. YOU SHOULD NOT ONLY REMEMBER THAT THE SOVIET
UNION IS ACCUSING CHINA VISIOUSLY EVERY DAY. THE
SOVIETS ALSO WANT THE APPEAREANCE OF CONCILIATION WITH
US SO AS TO BLUFF YOU. I WON'T GO INTO THE DETAILS
BUT MANY TACTICS ARE EMPLOYED. BUT WE KNOW THEIR
INTENTIONS SO WE JUST IGNORE THEM. THE SOVIET UNION

PLAYS MANY SMART TRICKS. YOU HAVE DEALT WITH THE

TENG: WE SHOULD LEARN FROM EACH OTHER. I THINK THAT
ALL AMERICAN POLITICIANS, INCLUDING YOU WHO ARE CONCERNED WITH GLOBAL QUESTIONS, ESPECIALLY IN THE ASIA AND
PACIFIC REGION, I HOPE YOU REALIZE HOW IMPORTANT
NORMAL RELATIONS ARE BETWEEN OUR TWO COUNTRIES, ESPECIALLY
AFTER WHAT HAS HAPPENED RECENTLY IN AFGHANISTAN
AND VIETNAM. I HOPE YOU WILL PONDER THIS QUESTION
CAREFULLY. SINCE YOU STUDY PROBLEMS OF THE ASIA AND
PACIFIC REGION YOU KNOW THE ROLE OF THE REGION IN
SOVIET STRATEGY. THE SOVIET DESIRE IS TO ESTABLISH
A COLLECTIVE SECURITY SYSTEM IN ASIA. IT WANTS TO
INCLUDE THE WHOLE REGION IN ITS ORBIT. WE HAVE
OPPOSED THIS SCHEME. NO ASIAN COUNTRY, INCLUDING
INDIA, DESIRES TO ACCEPT THIS PROPOSAL FOR A COLLECTIVE
CONFIDENTIAL

SECURITY SYSTEM BECAUSE THE SOVIETS' INTENTION IS
VERY CLEAR. NOW THE SOVIET UNION IS USING VIETNAM
AS ITS PAW TO SNEAK INTO ASEAN IN ORDER TO REALIZE THE
OBJECTIVE OF ESTABLISHING A COLLECTIVE SECURITY SYSTEM
IN ASIA. THE ASEAN COKNTRIES ARE AWARE OF THIS
OBJECTIVE. VIETNAM HAS STATED ITS INTENTION TO
JOIN ASEAN, WITH CONDITIONS ATTACHED. RECENTLY IT
DROPPED THESE CONDITIONS BECAUSE IT IS BENT ON SNEAKING
INTO THE ORGANIZATION. THUS IT IS NOT ADVISABLE THAT
YOU KEEP YOUR EYES ONLY ON THE SITUATION IN AFRICA
AND THE MIDDLE EAST. THE RUSSIANS ARE ALSO QUICKENING
THEIR STEPS IN ASIA. IT IS NOT ONLY AFRICA AND THE
MIDDLEEAST WHERE THE SOVIET UNIONHAS TAKEN NAKED
ACTIONS BUT ALSO ASIA. SOVIET NAVAL AND AIR FORCES
POSE A THREAT TO JAPAN. PEOPLE MAY THINK THAT IT IS
MAINLY IN THE NORTHERN PART OFJAPAN THAT THE SOVIET
NAVAL AND AIR FORCES POSE A THREAT AND MAKE SHOWS OF
FORCE, AND THAT THE THREAT IS DIRECTED AGAINST
CHINA. IT MAY BE TERRIBLE BUT WE ARE NOT AFRAID.
THERE IS SOME TALK IN THE WORLD THAT THE SSOVIET UNION
IS ENCIRCLING CHINA, BUT CHINA IS NOT AFRAID OF
ENCIRCLEMENT. WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE HISTORY OF THE
CHINESE REVOUTIION WE HAVE GROWN IN PERIODS OF ENCIRCLEMENT AND HAVE BROKEN A LOT OF ENCIRCLEMENTS. THE
ESTABLISHMENT OF MILITARY BASES IN VIETNAM IS OF
COURSE DIRECTED AGAINST CHINA BUT IT IS DIRECTED ONLY
AGAINST CHINA? CAMRANH BAY IS QUITE A DISTANCE
FROM CHINA. IT CAN POSE NO REAL THREAT AGAINST CHINA EVEN
IF IT CAN CUT OFF COMMUNICATIONS, BUT THE THREAT IS
MUCH BIGGER AGAINST JAPAN, AGAINST SOUTHEAST ASIA
AND AGAINST OTHER ASIAN COUNTRIES.

REMAINS UNRESOLVED HOW LONG WILL IT BE BEFORE YOU
TAKE ACTION TO REUNIFY TAIWAN WITH CHINA. SECOND, IF

COMMITMENTS WOUULDN'T THE ANTI-PRC PEOPLE NEGOTIATE
WITH THE SOVIET UNION AND THUS CREATE AN EVEN GREATER
PROBLEM FOR ALL OF US THANIF WE NEGOTIATE NORMALIZATION AND WORK OUT OUR DIFFERENCES LATER?
TENG: BY WITHDRAWAL OF THE US I REFER TO OUR THREE
CONDITIONS: THE WITHDRAWAL OF DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS,
THE WITHDRAWAL OF ALL MILITARY FORCES SAND INSTALLATIONS, AND BREAKING THE TREATY OFMUTUAL DEFENSE.
THEN THE US WILL HAVEPOLITICALLY WITHDRAWN FROM
TAIWAN AND THE CHINESE PEOPLE WILL BE LEFT TO SETTLE THE
ISSUE BY THEMSELVES. THE US CAN STILL MAINTAIN
UNOFFICIAL RELATIONS. THEN THE CHINESE PEOPLE WILL BE
LEFT TO SEETTLE THEIR OWN PROBLEMS BY THEMSELVES. YOU
REFERRED TO CERTAIN PEOPLE IN TAIWAN WHO ARE AGAINST
THE PRC. I THINK YOU ALSO NOTICED THE FACT THAT IT IS
STATED IN THE SHANGHAI COMMUNIQUE THAT ALL CHINESE
PEOPLE ON BOTH SIDES HOPE FOR REUNIFICATION. I SAID
ALREADY THAT THERE HAS TWICE BEEN COOPERATION BETWEEN
THE CHINESE COMMJNIST PARTY AND THE KUOMINTANG. LET
US SKIP OVER THE FIRST TIME AND LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT
THE SECOND WHICH TOOK PLACE AFTER TEN YEARS OF WAR
BETWEEN US. CHIANG KAI-SHEK HAD KILLED MILLIONS OF
CADRES AND PEOOLE BUT WHEN THE JAPANESE BEGAN THEIR
AGGRESSION WE CAME TOGETHER. OF COURSE, LATER WE
FELL APART AGAIN. THIS SHOWS THAT THERE MAY BE

SOLVE THE QUESTION E WILL FACE REALITIES. NOW THE
CRUX IS THAT SOME PEOPLE HOPE THAT CHINA WILL
UNDERTAKE A COMMITMENT NOT TO USE FORCE TO LIBERATE
TAIWAN. WE CANNOT COMMIT OURSELVES ON THIS QUESTION.
WE CANNOT UNDERTAKE THIS COMMITMENT BECAUSE IT IS A
MATTER INVOLVING SOVEREIGNTY. AS TO WHEN AND HOW WE
LIBERATE TAIWAN IT IS OUR INTERNAL AFFAIR AND NO OTHER
CUNTRY CAN POKE ITS NOSE INTO IT. SPEKING CANDIDLY,
IF THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT WERE TO UNDERTAKE THIS
COMMITMENT IT WOULD BLOCK THE WAY TO A SOLUTION OF THE
PROBLEM, INCLUDING A SOLUTION BY PEACEFUL MEANS.
RECENTLY THE U GOVERNMENT HAS TAKEN A MORE POSITIVE
SAND ON THIS QUESTION. IT WAS REPORTED THAT THE US
WOULDSELL SOME PLANES TO TAIWAN, THEN LATER IT WAS
REPORTED THAT YOU WOULD NOT SELL THE PLANES TO
TAIWAN. I THIK THIS IS VERY POSITIVE. IF SUCH AN
ACTION IS TAKEN IT WILL OBSTRUCT REUNIFICATION NEGOTIATIONS AND SETTLEMENT BY PEACEFUL MEANS. IF PEACEFUL
MEANS ARE IMPOSSIBLE THEN ARMED FORCE WILL HAVE TO BE
USED. BOTH CHIANG KAI-SHEK AND CHINAG CHING-KUO
WANTED TO REUNIFY THE COUNTRY THROUGH ARMED FORCE, TO
RECOVER THE MAINLAND BY ARMS. WE CANNOT UNDERTAKE
ANY COMMITMENT ASTO HOW TO ACHIEVE THE LIBERATION
OF TAIWAN, BUT WE WILL DO OUR BEST TO CREATE CONDITIONS TO SOLVE THIS QUESTION BY PEACEFUL MEANS.
SOME PEOPLE ARE WORRIED ABOUT SOVIET MEDDLING IN
TAIWAN. WE ARE NOT WORRIED. FIRST THERE IS THE
EXISTENCE OF THE PRC WITH A POPULATION OF 800 MILLION.
IF THE JAPANESE FORMULA IS FOLLOWED AND RELATIONS ARE
NORMALIZED BOTH JAPAN AND THE US WILL STILL MAINTAIN
NON-GOVERNMENTAL RELATIONS WITH TAIWAN. JUDGING
FROM THE HISTORICAL RECORD OF THE KUOMINTANG THEY WILL
NOT EASILY FALL INTO THE HANDS OF THE SOVIET UNION.
EVEN IF THIS HAPPENS WE HAVE WAYS TO COPE WITH THE
SITUATION. IF THERE WERE A SOVIET PRESENCE ON TAIWAN
AND WE USED FORCE I DON'T THINK THE US WOULD OPPOSE
