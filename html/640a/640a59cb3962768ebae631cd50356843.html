		<h3>Tor</h3>
		<p><a href="https://www.torproject.org">Tor</a> is an encrypted anonymising network that makes it harder to intercept internet communications, or see where communications are coming from or going to.</p>
		<p>In order to use the WikiLeaks public submission system as detailed above you can download the Tor Browser Bundle, which is a Firefox-like browser available for Windows, Mac OS X and GNU/Linux and pre-configured to connect using the anonymising system Tor.</p>
		<h4>Tails</h4>
		<p>If you are at high risk and you have the capacity to do so, you can also access the submission system through a secure operating system called <a href="https://tails.boum.org">Tails</a>. Tails is an operating system launched from a USB stick or a DVD that aim to leaves no traces when the computer is shut down after use and automatically routes your internet traffic through Tor. Tails will require you to have either a USB stick or a DVD at least 4GB big and a laptop or desktop computer.</p>

		<h3>Tips</h3>
		<p>Our submission system works hard to preserve your anonymity, but we recommend you also take some of your own precautions. Please review these basic guidelines. </p>
		<div>
			<h4>1. Contact us if you have specific problems</h4>
			<p>If you have a very large submission, or a submission with a complex format, or are a high-risk source, please <a href="#submit_help_contact">contact us</a>. In our experience it is always possible to find a custom solution for even the most seemingly difficult situations.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h4>2. What computer to use</h4>
			<p>If the computer you are uploading from could subsequently be audited in an investigation, consider using a computer that is not easily tied to you. Technical users can also use <a href="https://tails.boum.org">Tails</a> to help ensure you do not leave any records of your submission on the computer.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h4>3. Do not talk about your submission to others</h4>
			<p>If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in source protection – it is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This includes other media organisations.</p>
		</div>

	</div>

		<h3>After</h3>

		<div>
			<h4>1. Do not talk about your submission to others</h4>
			<p>If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in source protection – it is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This includes other media organisations.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h4>2. Act normal</h4>
			<p>If you are a high-risk source, avoid saying anything or doing anything after submitting which might promote suspicion. In particular, you should try to stick to your normal routine and behaviour.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h4>3. Remove traces of your submission</h4>
			<p>If you are a high-risk source and the computer you prepared your submission on, or uploaded it from, could subsequently be audited in an investigation, we recommend that you format and dispose of the computer hard drive and any other storage media you used.</p>
			<p>In particular, hard drives retain data after formatting which may be visible to a digital forensics team and flash media (USB sticks, memory cards and SSD drives) retain data even after a secure erasure. If you used flash media to store sensitive data, it is important to destroy the media.</p>
			<p>If you do this and are a high-risk source you should make sure there are no traces of the clean-up, since such traces themselves may draw suspicion.</p>
			<div>
				<h4>4. If you face legal action</h4>
				<p>If a legal action is brought against you as a result of your submission, there are organisations that may help you. The Courage Foundation is an international organisation dedicated to the protection of journalistic sources. You can find more details at <a href="https://www.couragefound.org">https://www.couragefound.org</a>.</p>

		<p>WikiLeaks publishes documents of political or historical importance that are censored or otherwise suppressed. We specialise in strategic global publishing and large archives.</p>
		<p>The following is the address of our secure site where you can anonymously upload your documents to WikiLeaks editors. You can only access this submissions system through Tor. (See our <a href="#submit_help_tor">Tor tab</a> for more information.) We also advise you to read our <a href="#submit_help_tips">tips for sources</a> before submitting.</p>

			<!--<div>
				Copy this address into your Tor browser. Advanced users, if they wish, can also add a further layer of encryption to their submission using <a href="#submit_wlkey">our public PGP key</a>.
			</div>-->
		</div>

		<p>If you cannot use Tor, or your submission is very large, or you have specific requirements, WikiLeaks provides several alternative methods. <a href="#submit_help_contact">Contact us</a> to discuss how to proceed.</p>

ANGKOR WAT IN WESTERN CAMBODIA. SOME DIPLOS BELIEVE THAT
CAREFULLY CALCULATED PUBLIC RELATIONS CAMPAIGN IS MEASURE
OF THE DESPERATION OF CAMBODIAN GOVT. SAYS IT IS OBVIOUS
THAT CAMBODIA HAS REALIZED THE NEED FOR FRIENDS,
PARTICULARLY IN SEASIA. CAMBODIA'S NEW DIPLOMACY HAS BEEN
MAKING SOME HEADWAY AMONG NEIGHBORS WHO WOULD LIKE TO SEE
LESS SHOOTING ON INDOCHINA PENINSULA.
COMMENT AND ANALYSIS
8. CHINA
DANIEL SOUTHERLAND (CSM) WRITES THAT CHINA WATCHERS ARE
LOOKING FORWARD TO WHAT HAPPENS WHEN 10 CHINESE FROM
COMMUNIST CHINA AND 1 FROM TAIWAN ATTEND SAME SCIENTIFIC
CONF IN SANFRANCISCO STARTING 10/29. IN PAST ONE SIDE OR
OTHER HAS REFUSED PARTICIPATE IN ANY CONF ATTENDED BY ITS
ADVERSARY. MAJOR CHANGE 2 MOS AGO WHEN DELS FROM 2 CHINAS
SHOWED UP AT SCIENTIFIC CONF IN TOKYO. SAN FRANCISCO
CONF MARKS 1ST TIME ON WHICH BOTH SIDES HAVE ATTENDED
CONF IN US. US OFFICIALS VIEW PEKING'S WILLINGNESS ATTEND
CONF W/TAIWAN DELS PRESENT AS ANOTHER SIGN OF CHINA'S
GROWING PRAGMATISM AND PART OF ITS CURRENT &quot;UNITED FRONT&quot;
CAMPAIGN TO WOO TAIWAN. US CHINA WATCHERS DO NOT SEE ANY
SIGN PEKING HAS MODIFIED ANY OF PRINCIPLES IT HOLDS TO ON
TAIWAN ISSUE. CHANGE IS MATTER OF TACTICS. US OFFICIALS
POINT OUT PEKING HAS YET TO TALK PUBLICLY ABOUT A &quot;PEACEFUL
RESOLUTION&quot; OR &quot;PEACEFUL REUNIFICATION&quot; WITH TAIWAN.
AMERICAN OFFICIALS THUS CAUTION AGAINST HIGH EXPECTATIONS
FOR FULL NORMALIZATION OF RELS W/PEKING ANY TIME SOON.
PEKING HAS YET TO RENOUNCE POSSIBLE USE OF MIL FORCE TO
LIBERATE TAIWAN, SOUTHERLAND SAYS. US OFFICIALS ARE
INTRIGUED BY WHAT THEY CALL PEKING'S &quot;SMILING OFFENSIVE&quot;
TOWARDS WEST AND TAIWAN.

9. CAMBODIA
CHITRIB'S YATES (BANGKOK) COMMENTS IN GLOBE (10/24) ON
&quot;DEAF EAR ON CAMBODIA SLAUGHTER.&quot; SAYS GENERATION AGO
A ZENOPHONIC PSYCHOPATH NAMED ADOLF HITLER WAS RELENTLESSLY

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
PURSUING HIS &quot;FINAL SOLUTION&quot;--A RATHER AMBIGUOUS METAPHOR
FOR THE ANNIHILATION OF MILLIONS OF PEOPLE IN THE NAME OF
RACIAL/POLITICAL PURITY. TODAY, YATES SAYS, IN A MISSOURISIZED CHUNK OF ASIA--CAMBODIA--HITLER'S LEGACY OF GENOCIDE
LIVES ON. PERHAPS AS MANY AS ONE-THIRD OF CAMBODIA'S
POPULATION HAVE DIED/BEEN KILLED OUTRIGHT BY HANDFUL OF
MARXIST-INSPIRED ZEALOTS CALLED KHMER ROUGE. AND AS WAS
CASE 40 YRS AGO, THE INTL COMMUNITY, THIS TIME UNDER
PHLEGMATIC/DESENSITIZED LEADERSHIP OF UN, HAS CHOSEN IGNORE
PLANET'S LATEST OUTBREAK OF MALEVOLENT SOCIAL ENGINEERING.
NOTES SEVERAL FACTORS, NOT THE LEAST OF WHICH ARE POL
NAIVETE/HYPOCRISY, CAN BE ATTRIBUTED TO THIS: 1) LEFTISTS
REFUSE TO BELIEVE ONE OF THE PUREST MARXIST REVOLUTIONS
EVER CONCEIVED HAS SUDDENLY/INEXPLICABLY TURNED TO
VINEGAR; 2) CONSERVATIVES HAVE TENDED TO DILUTE THE AMOUNT
OF ATTENTION FOCUSED ON CAMBODIA BY ATTRIBUTING RAMPAGE
THERE TO NATURAL NIHILISTIC TENDENCIES OF ALL LEFT-WING
GOVTS.
YATES SAYS BOTH WORLD'S LIBERALS/CONSERVATIVES NEED TO
REALIZE THAT WHAT HAS BEEN CONSTRUCTED UPON BONES OF
MILLIONS CAMBODIANS IS A FEUDAL, AGRARIAN-BASED SOCIETY
GOVERNED BY OMNIPOTENT TERRITORIAL WARLORDS. NOTES
GREATEST CRITICISM OF CAMBODIA'S NEW MASTERS HAS COME,
IRONICALLY, FROM ITS ANTAGONISTIC COMMUNIST NEIGHBOR,
VIETNAM. RECENTLY VIETNAMESE PREMIER PHAM VAN DONG
UNCLASSIFIED
PAGE 13

STATE 273765

RESPONDED TO REPORTERS' QUESTIONS ABOUT HUMAN RTS
VIOLATIONS IN VIETNAM BY SAYING: &quot;NEXT TO POL POT, I'M
AN ANGEL.&quot;
ACCORDING YATES, THE UN IS FULLY AWARE OF WHAT IS
HAPPENING IN CAMBODIA BUT REFUSES TO EITHER SPEAK OUT OR
TAKE ACTION AGAINST WHAT IT CONSIDERS TO BE A STRUGGLING,
LEFT-WING 3RD WORLD NATION. THE US, HE SAYS, MORE THAN
ANY OTHER NATION IS RESPONSIBLE FOR WHAT IS HAPPENING IN
CAMBODIA, BUT, LIKE THE UN, HAS CHOSEN TO REMAIN
RELATIVELY SILENT. SAID, ACCORDING TO SEVERAL ANGRY/OUTSPOKEN MEMBERS OF US DIPLO CORPS IN BANGKOK, THERE IS GROSS
HYPOCRISY MOTIVATED BY POLITICAL EXPEDIENCY WITHIN THE
DOS. &quot;TO SOUND OFF AGAINST CAMBODIA MIGHT RUIN WASHINGTON'S RAPPORT WITH CHINA, CAMBODIA'S GODFATHER, AND OF
COURSE WE CAN'T HAVE THAT,&quot; SA-D A BITTER AMERICAN DIPLO
IN BANGKOK. &quot;WHEN IT COMES RIGHT DOWN TO IT, THE
AMERICAN GOVERNMENT HAS CONCLUDED THAT THE CAMBODIAN
PEOPLE ARE EXPENDABLE.&quot; VANCE
