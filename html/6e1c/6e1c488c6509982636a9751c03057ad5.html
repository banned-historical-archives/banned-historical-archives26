		<h3>Tor</h3>
		<p><a href="https://www.torproject.org">Tor</a> is an encrypted anonymising network that makes it harder to intercept internet communications, or see where communications are coming from or going to.</p>
		<p>In order to use the WikiLeaks public submission system as detailed above you can download the Tor Browser Bundle, which is a Firefox-like browser available for Windows, Mac OS X and GNU/Linux and pre-configured to connect using the anonymising system Tor.</p>
		<h4>Tails</h4>
		<p>If you are at high risk and you have the capacity to do so, you can also access the submission system through a secure operating system called <a href="https://tails.boum.org">Tails</a>. Tails is an operating system launched from a USB stick or a DVD that aim to leaves no traces when the computer is shut down after use and automatically routes your internet traffic through Tor. Tails will require you to have either a USB stick or a DVD at least 4GB big and a laptop or desktop computer.</p>

		<h3>Tips</h3>
		<p>Our submission system works hard to preserve your anonymity, but we recommend you also take some of your own precautions. Please review these basic guidelines. </p>
		<div>
			<h4>1. Contact us if you have specific problems</h4>
			<p>If you have a very large submission, or a submission with a complex format, or are a high-risk source, please <a href="#submit_help_contact">contact us</a>. In our experience it is always possible to find a custom solution for even the most seemingly difficult situations.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h4>2. What computer to use</h4>
			<p>If the computer you are uploading from could subsequently be audited in an investigation, consider using a computer that is not easily tied to you. Technical users can also use <a href="https://tails.boum.org">Tails</a> to help ensure you do not leave any records of your submission on the computer.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h4>3. Do not talk about your submission to others</h4>
			<p>If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in source protection – it is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This includes other media organisations.</p>
		</div>

	</div>

		<h3>After</h3>

		<div>
			<h4>1. Do not talk about your submission to others</h4>
			<p>If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in source protection – it is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This includes other media organisations.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h4>2. Act normal</h4>
			<p>If you are a high-risk source, avoid saying anything or doing anything after submitting which might promote suspicion. In particular, you should try to stick to your normal routine and behaviour.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h4>3. Remove traces of your submission</h4>
			<p>If you are a high-risk source and the computer you prepared your submission on, or uploaded it from, could subsequently be audited in an investigation, we recommend that you format and dispose of the computer hard drive and any other storage media you used.</p>
			<p>In particular, hard drives retain data after formatting which may be visible to a digital forensics team and flash media (USB sticks, memory cards and SSD drives) retain data even after a secure erasure. If you used flash media to store sensitive data, it is important to destroy the media.</p>
			<p>If you do this and are a high-risk source you should make sure there are no traces of the clean-up, since such traces themselves may draw suspicion.</p>
			<div>
				<h4>4. If you face legal action</h4>
				<p>If a legal action is brought against you as a result of your submission, there are organisations that may help you. The Courage Foundation is an international organisation dedicated to the protection of journalistic sources. You can find more details at <a href="https://www.couragefound.org">https://www.couragefound.org</a>.</p>

		<p>WikiLeaks publishes documents of political or historical importance that are censored or otherwise suppressed. We specialise in strategic global publishing and large archives.</p>
		<p>The following is the address of our secure site where you can anonymously upload your documents to WikiLeaks editors. You can only access this submissions system through Tor. (See our <a href="#submit_help_tor">Tor tab</a> for more information.) We also advise you to read our <a href="#submit_help_tips">tips for sources</a> before submitting.</p>

			<!--<div>
				Copy this address into your Tor browser. Advanced users, if they wish, can also add a further layer of encryption to their submission using <a href="#submit_wlkey">our public PGP key</a>.
			</div>-->
		</div>

		<p>If you cannot use Tor, or your submission is very large, or you have specific requirements, WikiLeaks provides several alternative methods. <a href="#submit_help_contact">Contact us</a> to discuss how to proceed.</p>

3. FOLLOWING MY MEETING WITH VICE FOREIGN MINISTER ZHANG
WENJIN ON DECEMBER 3, AT WHICH TIME I HAD OFFERED TO CONVEY BACK
TO WASHINGTON ANY MESSAGE WHICH THE CHINESE MIGHT DESIRE, I AS

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
THE TWO PRMIE MINISTERS AND IN THE DISCUSSION WITH
DENG XIAOPING THEY HAD REVIEWED THE INTERNATIONAL SITUATION
WITH EMPHASIS ON DEVELOPMENTS AFFECTING THE ASIAN AND PACIFIC REGION.
THEY HAD ALSO DISCUSSED THE SITUATION IN INDOCHINA, KAMPUCHEA AND THE
PERSIAN GULF. THE CHINESE HAD TOLD OHIRA THAT THEY EXPECTED THE VI
NAMESE TO BEGIN SOON THEIR MAJOR DRY SEASON OFFENSIVE TO ATTEMPT TO
COMPLETE THE DESTRUCTION OF THE KAMPUCHEAN RESISTANCE. IT APPEARED
THAT THEIR OBJECTIVE WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO ATTAIN. EVEN IF THE
KHMER RESISTANCE SUFFERED SERIOUS SETBACKS AND POL POT WAS WIPED
OUT, THIS DID NOT MEAN THE END OF KAMPUCHEAN OPPOSITION TO THE
VIETNAMESE. OTHERS WOULD ARISE.
5. THE FOREIGN MINISTER SAID THAT HEY HAD TOLD OHIRA THEY
BELIEVED THE STRUGGLE AGAINST THE VIETNAMESE CONTROL IN LAOS WAS
BEGINNING TO ESCALATE. THE SITUATION IN VIETNAM ITSELF WAS BECOMING
WORSE AND WORSE AND THE COMMON PEOPLE FACRED TREMENDOUS DIFFICULTY
IN THEIR BASIC LIVING CONDITIONS.
6. CHINA BASICALLY SUPPORTED THE KAMPUCHEAN PEOPLE IN THEIR
RESISTANCE AGAINST VIETNAMESE AGGRESSION. CHINA BELIEVED A POLITICAL
SOLUTION MIGHT EVENTULLY BE POSSIBLE BUT WAS AT THE PRESENT TIME UNREALISTIC SINCE THE VIETNAMESE REFUSE TO AGREE TO ANY SUCH MOVE. THE
VIETNAMESE ARE NOW ENGAGED IN AN ALL OUT DRY SEASON OFFENSIVE AND
SECRET

STATE 321426

WOULD NOT AGREE TO WITHDRAW THEIR FORCES FROM KAMPUCHEA.
7. OHIRA AND THE CHINESE HAD AGREED TO REAFFIRM THAT EACH
SIDE WOULD PROCEED FROM ITS OWN POSITION TO MAKE EFFORTS TO PROMOTE
PEACE AND STABILITY IN ASIA AND THE WORLD. OHIRA AND HUA HAD AGREED
THAT EXCHANGES OF VIEEWS ON WORLD DEVELOPMENTS SHOULD BE HELD IN
THE SPIRIT OF THE PEACE AND FRIENDSHIP TREATY. THE TWO SIDES SHOULD
REGULARLY CONSULT AND DEVELOP A LONG-TERM RELATIONSHIP ON THIS BASIS.
ACCORDINGLY, OFFICIAL EXCHAGES WOULD BE PROMOTED ON VARIOUS LEVELS
WITH THE AIM OF FURTHER DEEPENDING MUTUAL UNDERSTANDING AND TRUST.
8. PRIME MINISTER OHIRA HAD SAID THAT JAPAN WELCOMED THE
STRENGTHENING OF CHINESE ECONOMIC COOPERATION WITH OTHER
COUNTRIES INTERESTED IN ENGAGING IN CHINA'S NATIONAL CONSTRUCTION.
SIX ITEMS INVOLVING ECONOMIC COOPERATION HAD BEEN AGREED UPON
AND JAPAN WAS PREPARED TO PROVIDE 50 BILLION N 1979
TO FURTHER COOPERATION IN THESE AREAS. IN 1980 AND IN FOLLOWING YEARS
,
THE EXACT AMOUNT OF CREDITS TOWARD THE SIX ITEMS WOULD BE DECIDED AT
THE MANAGERIAL LEVEL. THE CONDITIONS FOR THE LOANS INVOLVED REPAYMENT IN 30 YEARS AT THREE PERCENT, FIRST PAYMENT DUE AFTER TEN YEARS.
THE JAPANESE HAD SAID THAT THEY WOULD ALSO HELP BUILD A
MODERN HOSPITAL IN BEIJING AS A SYMPBOL OF SINO-JAPANESE FRIENDSHIP.
THE TWO SIDES HAD ALSO SIGNED A CULTURAL AGREEMENT AND DISCUSSED
AN AGREEMENT IN SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL COOPERATION WHICH WOULD
BE SIGNED EARLY NEXT YEAR. THE FOREIGN MINISTER NOTED THAT THE
JAPANESE LOANS WOULD BE UNCONDITIONAL.

9. THE JAPANESE GOVERNMENT WAS NOW INSTITUTING PROCEDURES SO
THAT CHINA WOULD BE COVERED UNDER CONDITIONS APPLIABLE TO UNDERDEVELOPED COUNTRIES.
10. THE TWO SIDES HAD ALSO DISCUSSED COOPERATION IN THE
DEVELOPMENT OF ENERGY RESOURCES. THIS INCLUDED PRELIMINARY AGREEMENT ON JOINT DEVELOPMENT OF OIL RESOURCES IN THE BOHAI GULF.

11. CHAIRMAN HUA HAD ACCEPTED AN INVITATION TO GO TO JAPAN IN
MAY OF 1980. THE FOREIGN MINISTER SAID THAT SPECIFIC DETAILS WILL BE
DISCUSSED AT A LTER TIME.
12. BURMA. HUANG SAID THAT HE HAD FOUND THE ECONOIC SITUATION
IN BURMA BETTER THAN IN SURROUNDING COUNTRIES. BURMA WAS TAKING
ACTIVE FOREIGN POLICY MEASURES TO IMPROVE RELATIONS WITH ITS
NEIGHBORS. FOR EXAMPLE, THE BURMESE HAD AGREED TO TAKE BACK ALL OF
THE 100,000 REFUGEES IN BANGLADESH. ONLY A FEW WOULD REMAIN ACROSS
THE BRODER.
13. THE BURMESE HAD EXPLAINED TO HUANG WHY THEY WITHDREW FROM THE
NON-ALIGNED MOVEMENT CONFERENCE AT HAVANA. HUANG HAD TOLD THEM THAT
THE BURMESE ACTION REFLECTED THE STRONG DISTASTE FELT BY THE MAJORITY
OF NAM MEMBERS FOR THE UNSCRUPULOUS EFFORT BY CUBA TO WSIST THE NONALIGNED MOVEMENT AWAY FROM ITS PROPER GOALS. HUANG SAID THAT HE HAD
THE FEELING THAT BURMA WOULD BE MORE ACTIVE DIPLOMATY THAN PREVIOUSLY.
14. NEAPL. HUANG SAID THAT NEPAL WAS NOW FACED WITH A REFERENDUM CONCERNING THE SHAPE OF A NEW NATIONAL SYSTEM OF GOVERNMENT.
THEY COULD EITHER MAINTAIN THEIR PRESENT SYSTEM OR CHANGE IT TO A
PARLIAMENTARY GOVERNMENT. HE HAD FOUND THE INTERNAL SITUATION IN
NEPAL RELATIVELY STABLE AND QUIET. THE ECONOMIC SITUATION, HOWEVER,
WAS MORE DIFFICULT SINCE THERE HAD BEEN A LONG DRY SPELL
AND FIFFICULTIES WITH THE HARVEST THE NAPALESE HAD WANTED HELP
WITH FOOD GRAIN. CHINA HAD GIVEN A POSITIVE RESPONSE.
15. THE NAPALESE WERE CONCERNED, ACCORDING TO THE FOREIGN MINISTER,
ABOUT THREATENDING REMARKS MADE BY MRS. GHANDI. THE CHINESE ALSO
UNDERSTOOD THAT BHUTAN NOW FEELS ILL AT EASE WITH REGARD TO INDIA.
THE PRC IS CONCERNED THAT MRS. GHANDI MIGHT ADOPT MORE HIGHHANDED TACTICS WITH INDIA'S NEIGHBORS.

16. DURING HUANG'S VISIT, CHINA AND NEPAL HAD SIGNED A PROTOCOL
ON THE JOINT RE-EXAMINATION OF THEIR BOUNDARIES. THE SINONEPALI BOUNDARY HAD LONG BEEN DELINEATED BY MAKRERS ON THE GROUND
WHICH FOR TECHNICAL REASONS WERE NOT ACCURATELY DEPICTED ON MAPS.

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
AERIAL SURVEYS HAD PROVIDED A MORE ACCURATE BASIS FOR NEW MAPS.
THROUGH THE CONCLUSION OF THIS PROTOCOL THE STWO SIDES WOULD GAIN
A &quot;FRIENDLY&quot; BOUNDARY WHICH WOULD BE BASED ON MORE SOLID AND ACCURATE
DEMARKATION.
17. KAMPUCHEA. HUANG SAID THAT THE BRITISH HAD INFORMED THE PRC
IN ADVANCE ABOUT DERECOGNITION OF DEMOCRATIC KAMPUCHEA. MRS. THTCHER
HAD WRITTEN A LETTER TO PREMIER HUA WHO HAD WRITTEN BACK THAT CHINA
WOULD NOT AGREE WITH MEASURES TAKEN BY THE UK. THE REASONS PUT
FORWARD
BY BRITIAN WERE UNTENABLE. FIRST, THE BRITISH HAD SAID THAT THE
GOVERNMENT OF DEMOCRATIC KAMPUCHEA WAS NO LONGER IN EFFECTIVE CONTROL
OF KAMPUCHEAN TERRITORY. CHINA WONDERED HOW THEY REGARDED THE MAINTENANCE OF EUROPEAN EXILED GOVERNMENTS IN BRITIAN DURING WORLD WAR
II. SECONDLY, THE UNITED NS GENERAL ASSEMBLY HAD JUST VOTED
WITH BRITISH SUPPORT TO MAINTAIN THE DEMOCRATIC KAMPUCHEAN SEAT.
BEFORE THE SESSION WAS EVEN OVER, BRITIAN HAD HURRIEDLY TAKEN THIS
UNTENABLE STEP. WE CAN EXPECT, SAID HUANG, THAT HTHE SOVIET BLOC
AND VIETNAME ARE GLING TO USE THIS ACTION TO LAUNCH A MOVEMENT TO
RECOGNIZE THE HENG SAMRIN PUPPETS AND UNDERMINE THE RESISTANCE IN
KAMPUCHEA.
18. THE FOREIGN MINISTER SAID THAT CHINA HOPED THE UNITED STATES
WOULD PAY CLOSE ATTENTIN TO THIS DEVELOPMENT AND CONTINUE TO SUPPORT
THE KAMPUCHEAN PEOPLE IN THEIR JUST STRUGGLE. ACTIONS SHOLD NOT
BE TAKEN WHICH WOULD MAKE FRIENDS UNHAPPY AND SATISFY ONLY ENEMIES.
19. AS FAR AS THE ALLEGED INHUMANE PRACTICES AND ATROCITIES SUPPOSEDLY CARRIED OUT BY THE POL POT GOVERNMENT WERE CONCERNED IT
WAS TRUE THAT THE POL POT FORCES HAD MADE MISTAKES. HOWEVER, THESE
WERE GREATLY EXAGGERATED BY ANTI-COMMUNIST ELEMENTS AROUND THE

WORLD ENGAGED IN PROPAGANDA EFFORTS AGAINST DEMOCRACTIC
KAMPUCHEA. THEY HAD SAID THAT THREE MILLION PEOPLE, ALMOST ONE HALF
OF THE KHMER OPULATION HAD BEEN WIPED OUT.
20. ONE SHOLD DIFFERENTIATE, ACCORDING TO HUANG, BETWEEN THE
MISTAKEN POLICIES OF POL POT AND MALICIOUS ATTACKS MADE UPON HIS
GOVERNMENT. IN CONSIDERING THE KAMPUCHEAN QUESTION, ONE SHOLD PROCEED
FROM ALL ASPECTS TO MAINTAIN THE RESISTANCE INSIDE THE COUNTRY, STOP
SOVIET EXPANSIONISM IN SOUTHEAST ASIA AND THE OVERALL SOVIET SOUTHWARD DRIVE. IF THE SITUATION IS LOOKED AT FROM A NEARSIGHTED POINT
OF VIEW, THIS WILL ONLY BRING DISASTER. THERE IS A CHINESE SAYING
THAT &quot;A MOUSE CAN ONLY SEE ONE INCH IN FRONT OF HIS FACE.&quot;
21. IRAN. CHINA IS MUCH CONCERNED, HUANG SAID, ABOUT THE INCREASED
TENSION BETWEEN IRAN AND THE UNITED STATES CAUSEC BY THE HOLDING OF
THE HOSTAGES. THIS TURMOIL IN IRAN COULD SPREAD TO NEIGHBORING AREAS,
INCLUDING SAUDI ARABIA. NOW THE SAUDI AUTHORITIES
WERE TRYING TO IZE THE EFFECT OF THE INCIDENT IN MECCA BUT THERE
HAD BEEN MUCH GREATER UNREST OVER A LARGER AREAS THAN THEY

WERE ADMITTING TO.
21. CHINA SAW NOPROSPECT OF INTERNAL STABILITY IN IRAN. THE ONLY
PEOPLE WHO WOULD PROFIT FROM THE TURMOIL IN IRAN WERE THE SOVIETS.
THE IRANIANA PEOPLE WOULD BE THE FIRST TO SUFFER AND THE BIGGEST
VICTIMS OF UNREST. THE PRC HOPED THAT THE PROBLEM IN IRANIAN-U.S.
RELATIONS WOLD BE SOLVED IN A PEACEABLE AND JUST WAY. THE CHINESE
GOVERNMENT H BEEN WORKING WITH A NUMBER OF COUNTRIES FRIENDLY WITH
IRAN TO TRY TO GET THE APPROPRIATE ADVICE TO THE IRANIAN
AUTHORITES. CHINA WAS THE PRESIENT OF THE UNITED NATIONS SECURITY

IRAN AND OTHER ISMAMIC COUNTRIES.
23. SINO-U.S. TRADE AGREEMENT. HUANG SAID THAT HE HOPED THE U.S.
GOVERNMENT &quot;WOULD GIVE IMPETUS TO CONGRESS&quot; TO PASS THE AGREEMENT
AT AN EARLY DATE.
24. EXPORT LICENSING. THE QUESTION OF THE LICENSING OF U.S.
PRODUCTS TO BE SXPORTED TO CHINA HAD BEEN MENTIONED BY THE PRC ON
SEVERAL OCCASIONS, HUANG SAID. ON SEPTEMBER 27 THE PRC GAVE THE USG
A LIST OF GOODS FOR WHICH CONTRACTS HAD BEEN SIGNED BUT DELIVERY
NOT MADE BECAUSE OF LACK OF EXPORT LICENSES. IN LATE OCTOBER TRADE
MINISTER LI QIANG HAD GIVEN A SIMILAR LIST TO THE USG CONCERNING A
NUMBER OF ITEMS WICH CHINA WISHES TO IMPORT FROM THE UNITED STATES.
DURING HIS VISIT TO WASHINGTON, LI HAD BEEN TOLD BY VICE PRESIDENT
MONDALE THAT THE USG NOW LOOKS UPON CHINA AS A FRIENDLY COUNTRY AND
SAID THIS SHOULD BE DEMONSTRATED WHEN WE DEAL WITH SPECIFIC PROBLEMS.
BUT NOW CHINA ANDSOVIET UNION ARE STILL PLACED IN THE SAME CATEGORY IN OFFICIAL DOCUMENTS DEALING WITN THE LIMITATION OF
CERTAIN EXPORTS. UP TO NOW THE CHINESE HAVE SEEN NO CHANGE IN THE
U.S. POLICY ON LIMITATION OF EXPORTS TO CHINA. HUANG SAID THA THE PRC
CONSIDERED THIS STATE OF AFFAIRS AS NOT CONFORMING WITH THE
PRESENT RELTIONSHIP BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES OR HOW THEY ENVISAGED
THE SHAPE OF THE FUTURE RELATIONSHIP.

27. HUANG SAID THAT THE ASEAN GOVERMENTS HAD ALREADY MADE THEIR

3. FOLLOWING MY MEETING WITH VICE FOREIGN MINISTER ZHANG
WENJIN ON DECEMBER 3, AT WHICH TIME I HAD OFFERED TO CONVEY BACK
TO WASHINGTON ANY MESSAGE WHICH THE CHINESE MIGHT DESIRE, I AS
CALLED IN BY FORIGN MINISTER HUANG HUA DECEMBER 7. HUANG TOLD ME

AND NEPAL, VIEWS ON BRITISH DERECOGNITION OF POL POT, THE
SITUATION IN IRAN, PASSAGE OF THE TRADE AGREEMENT, EXPORT LICENSING

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
THE TWO PRMIE MINISTERS AND IN THE DISCUSSION WITH
DENG XIAOPING THEY HAD REVIEWED THE INTERNATIONAL SITUATION
WITH EMPHASIS ON DEVELOPMENTS AFFECTING THE ASIAN AND PACIFIC REGION.
THEY HAD ALSO DISCUSSED THE SITUATION IN INDOCHINA, KAMPUCHEA AND THE
PERSIAN GULF. THE CHINESE HAD TOLD OHIRA THAT THEY EXPECTED THE VI
NAMESE TO BEGIN SOON THEIR MAJOR DRY SEASON OFFENSIVE TO ATTEMPT TO
COMPLETE THE DESTRUCTION OF THE KAMPUCHEAN RESISTANCE. IT APPEARED
THAT THEIR OBJECTIVE WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO ATTAIN. EVEN IF THE
KHMER RESISTANCE SUFFERED SERIOUS SETBACKS AND POL POT WAS WIPED
OUT, THIS DID NOT MEAN THE END OF KAMPUCHEAN OPPOSITION TO THE
VIETNAMESE. OTHERS WOULD ARISE.
5. THE FOREIGN MINISTER SAID THAT HEY HAD TOLD OHIRA THEY
BELIEVED THE STRUGGLE AGAINST THE VIETNAMESE CONTROL IN LAOS WAS
BEGINNING TO ESCALATE. THE SITUATION IN VIETNAM ITSELF WAS BECOMING
WORSE AND WORSE AND THE COMMON PEOPLE FACRED TREMENDOUS DIFFICULTY
IN THEIR BASIC LIVING CONDITIONS.
6. CHINA BASICALLY SUPPORTED THE KAMPUCHEAN PEOPLE IN THEIR
RESISTANCE AGAINST VIETNAMESE AGGRESSION. CHINA BELIEVED A POLITICAL
SOLUTION MIGHT EVENTULLY BE POSSIBLE BUT WAS AT THE PRESENT TIME UNREALISTIC SINCE THE VIETNAMESE REFUSE TO AGREE TO ANY SUCH MOVE. THE
VIETNAMESE ARE NOW ENGAGED IN AN ALL OUT DRY SEASON OFFENSIVE AND
SECRET
PAGE 03

STATE 321426

WOULD NOT AGREE TO WITHDRAW THEIR FORCES FROM KAMPUCHEA.
7. OHIRA AND THE CHINESE HAD AGREED TO REAFFIRM THAT EACH
SIDE WOULD PROCEED FROM ITS OWN POSITION TO MAKE EFFORTS TO PROMOTE
PEACE AND STABILITY IN ASIA AND THE WORLD. OHIRA AND HUA HAD AGREED
THAT EXCHANGES OF VIEEWS ON WORLD DEVELOPMENTS SHOULD BE HELD IN
THE SPIRIT OF THE PEACE AND FRIENDSHIP TREATY. THE TWO SIDES SHOULD
REGULARLY CONSULT AND DEVELOP A LONG-TERM RELATIONSHIP ON THIS BASIS.
ACCORDINGLY, OFFICIAL EXCHAGES WOULD BE PROMOTED ON VARIOUS LEVELS
WITH THE AIM OF FURTHER DEEPENDING MUTUAL UNDERSTANDING AND TRUST.
8. PRIME MINISTER OHIRA HAD SAID THAT JAPAN WELCOMED THE
STRENGTHENING OF CHINESE ECONOMIC COOPERATION WITH OTHER
COUNTRIES INTERESTED IN ENGAGING IN CHINA'S NATIONAL CONSTRUCTION.
SIX ITEMS INVOLVING ECONOMIC COOPERATION HAD BEEN AGREED UPON
AND JAPAN WAS PREPARED TO PROVIDE 50 BILLION N 1979
TO FURTHER COOPERATION IN THESE AREAS. IN 1980 AND IN FOLLOWING YEARS
,
THE EXACT AMOUNT OF CREDITS TOWARD THE SIX ITEMS WOULD BE DECIDED AT
THE MANAGERIAL LEVEL. THE CONDITIONS FOR THE LOANS INVOLVED REPAYMENT IN 30 YEARS AT THREE PERCENT, FIRST PAYMENT DUE AFTER TEN YEARS.
THE JAPANESE HAD SAID THAT THEY WOULD ALSO HELP BUILD A
MODERN HOSPITAL IN BEIJING AS A SYMPBOL OF SINO-JAPANESE FRIENDSHIP.
THE TWO SIDES HAD ALSO SIGNED A CULTURAL AGREEMENT AND DISCUSSED
AN AGREEMENT IN SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNICAL COOPERATION WHICH WOULD
BE SIGNED EARLY NEXT YEAR. THE FOREIGN MINISTER NOTED THAT THE
JAPANESE LOANS WOULD BE UNCONDITIONAL.

9. THE JAPANESE GOVERNMENT WAS NOW INSTITUTING PROCEDURES SO
THAT CHINA WOULD BE COVERED UNDER CONDITIONS APPLIABLE TO UNDERDEVELOPED COUNTRIES.
10. THE TWO SIDES HAD ALSO DISCUSSED COOPERATION IN THE
DEVELOPMENT OF ENERGY RESOURCES. THIS INCLUDED PRELIMINARY AGREEMENT ON JOINT DEVELOPMENT OF OIL RESOURCES IN THE BOHAI GULF.

11. CHAIRMAN HUA HAD ACCEPTED AN INVITATION TO GO TO JAPAN IN
MAY OF 1980. THE FOREIGN MINISTER SAID THAT SPECIFIC DETAILS WILL BE
DISCUSSED AT A LTER TIME.
12. BURMA. HUANG SAID THAT HE HAD FOUND THE ECONOIC SITUATION
IN BURMA BETTER THAN IN SURROUNDING COUNTRIES. BURMA WAS TAKING
ACTIVE FOREIGN POLICY MEASURES TO IMPROVE RELATIONS WITH ITS
NEIGHBORS. FOR EXAMPLE, THE BURMESE HAD AGREED TO TAKE BACK ALL OF
THE 100,000 REFUGEES IN BANGLADESH. ONLY A FEW WOULD REMAIN ACROSS
THE BRODER.
13. THE BURMESE HAD EXPLAINED TO HUANG WHY THEY WITHDREW FROM THE
NON-ALIGNED MOVEMENT CONFERENCE AT HAVANA. HUANG HAD TOLD THEM THAT
THE BURMESE ACTION REFLECTED THE STRONG DISTASTE FELT BY THE MAJORITY
OF NAM MEMBERS FOR THE UNSCRUPULOUS EFFORT BY CUBA TO WSIST THE NONALIGNED MOVEMENT AWAY FROM ITS PROPER GOALS. HUANG SAID THAT HE HAD
THE FEELING THAT BURMA WOULD BE MORE ACTIVE DIPLOMATY THAN PREVIOUSLY.
14. NEAPL. HUANG SAID THAT NEPAL WAS NOW FACED WITH A REFERENDUM CONCERNING THE SHAPE OF A NEW NATIONAL SYSTEM OF GOVERNMENT.
THEY COULD EITHER MAINTAIN THEIR PRESENT SYSTEM OR CHANGE IT TO A
PARLIAMENTARY GOVERNMENT. HE HAD FOUND THE INTERNAL SITUATION IN
NEPAL RELATIVELY STABLE AND QUIET. THE ECONOMIC SITUATION, HOWEVER,
WAS MORE DIFFICULT SINCE THERE HAD BEEN A LONG DRY SPELL
AND FIFFICULTIES WITH THE HARVEST THE NAPALESE HAD WANTED HELP
WITH FOOD GRAIN. CHINA HAD GIVEN A POSITIVE RESPONSE.
15. THE NAPALESE WERE CONCERNED, ACCORDING TO THE FOREIGN MINISTER,
ABOUT THREATENDING REMARKS MADE BY MRS. GHANDI. THE CHINESE ALSO
UNDERSTOOD THAT BHUTAN NOW FEELS ILL AT EASE WITH REGARD TO INDIA.
THE PRC IS CONCERNED THAT MRS. GHANDI MIGHT ADOPT MORE HIGHHANDED TACTICS WITH INDIA'S NEIGHBORS.

16. DURING HUANG'S VISIT, CHINA AND NEPAL HAD SIGNED A PROTOCOL
ON THE JOINT RE-EXAMINATION OF THEIR BOUNDARIES. THE SINONEPALI BOUNDARY HAD LONG BEEN DELINEATED BY MAKRERS ON THE GROUND
WHICH FOR TECHNICAL REASONS WERE NOT ACCURATELY DEPICTED ON MAPS.

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
AERIAL SURVEYS HAD PROVIDED A MORE ACCURATE BASIS FOR NEW MAPS.
THROUGH THE CONCLUSION OF THIS PROTOCOL THE STWO SIDES WOULD GAIN
A &quot;FRIENDLY&quot; BOUNDARY WHICH WOULD BE BASED ON MORE SOLID AND ACCURATE
DEMARKATION.
17. KAMPUCHEA. HUANG SAID THAT THE BRITISH HAD INFORMED THE PRC
IN ADVANCE ABOUT DERECOGNITION OF DEMOCRATIC KAMPUCHEA. MRS. THTCHER
HAD WRITTEN A LETTER TO PREMIER HUA WHO HAD WRITTEN BACK THAT CHINA
WOULD NOT AGREE WITH MEASURES TAKEN BY THE UK. THE REASONS PUT
FORWARD
BY BRITIAN WERE UNTENABLE. FIRST, THE BRITISH HAD SAID THAT THE
GOVERNMENT OF DEMOCRATIC KAMPUCHEA WAS NO LONGER IN EFFECTIVE CONTROL
OF KAMPUCHEAN TERRITORY. CHINA WONDERED HOW THEY REGARDED THE MAINTENANCE OF EUROPEAN EXILED GOVERNMENTS IN BRITIAN DURING WORLD WAR
II. SECONDLY, THE UNITED NS GENERAL ASSEMBLY HAD JUST VOTED
WITH BRITISH SUPPORT TO MAINTAIN THE DEMOCRATIC KAMPUCHEAN SEAT.
BEFORE THE SESSION WAS EVEN OVER, BRITIAN HAD HURRIEDLY TAKEN THIS
UNTENABLE STEP. WE CAN EXPECT, SAID HUANG, THAT HTHE SOVIET BLOC
AND VIETNAME ARE GLING TO USE THIS ACTION TO LAUNCH A MOVEMENT TO
RECOGNIZE THE HENG SAMRIN PUPPETS AND UNDERMINE THE RESISTANCE IN
KAMPUCHEA.
18. THE FOREIGN MINISTER SAID THAT CHINA HOPED THE UNITED STATES
WOULD PAY CLOSE ATTENTIN TO THIS DEVELOPMENT AND CONTINUE TO SUPPORT
THE KAMPUCHEAN PEOPLE IN THEIR JUST STRUGGLE. ACTIONS SHOLD NOT
BE TAKEN WHICH WOULD MAKE FRIENDS UNHAPPY AND SATISFY ONLY ENEMIES.
19. AS FAR AS THE ALLEGED INHUMANE PRACTICES AND ATROCITIES SUPPOSEDLY CARRIED OUT BY THE POL POT GOVERNMENT WERE CONCERNED IT
WAS TRUE THAT THE POL POT FORCES HAD MADE MISTAKES. HOWEVER, THESE
WERE GREATLY EXAGGERATED BY ANTI-COMMUNIST ELEMENTS AROUND THE

WORLD ENGAGED IN PROPAGANDA EFFORTS AGAINST DEMOCRACTIC
KAMPUCHEA. THEY HAD SAID THAT THREE MILLION PEOPLE, ALMOST ONE HALF
OF THE KHMER OPULATION HAD BEEN WIPED OUT.
20. ONE SHOLD DIFFERENTIATE, ACCORDING TO HUANG, BETWEEN THE
MISTAKEN POLICIES OF POL POT AND MALICIOUS ATTACKS MADE UPON HIS
GOVERNMENT. IN CONSIDERING THE KAMPUCHEAN QUESTION, ONE SHOLD PROCEED
FROM ALL ASPECTS TO MAINTAIN THE RESISTANCE INSIDE THE COUNTRY, STOP
SOVIET EXPANSIONISM IN SOUTHEAST ASIA AND THE OVERALL SOVIET SOUTHWARD DRIVE. IF THE SITUATION IS LOOKED AT FROM A NEARSIGHTED POINT
OF VIEW, THIS WILL ONLY BRING DISASTER. THERE IS A CHINESE SAYING
THAT &quot;A MOUSE CAN ONLY SEE ONE INCH IN FRONT OF HIS FACE.&quot;
21. IRAN. CHINA IS MUCH CONCERNED, HUANG SAID, ABOUT THE INCREASED
TENSION BETWEEN IRAN AND THE UNITED STATES CAUSEC BY THE HOLDING OF
THE HOSTAGES. THIS TURMOIL IN IRAN COULD SPREAD TO NEIGHBORING AREAS,
INCLUDING SAUDI ARABIA. NOW THE SAUDI AUTHORITIES
WERE TRYING TO IZE THE EFFECT OF THE INCIDENT IN MECCA BUT THERE
HAD BEEN MUCH GREATER UNREST OVER A LARGER AREAS THAN THEY

23. SINO-U.S. TRADE AGREEMENT. HUANG SAID THAT HE HOPED THE U.S.
GOVERNMENT &quot;WOULD GIVE IMPETUS TO CONGRESS&quot; TO PASS THE AGREEMENT
AT AN EARLY DATE.
24. EXPORT LICENSING. THE QUESTION OF THE LICENSING OF U.S.
