		<h3>Tor</h3>
		<p><a href="https://www.torproject.org">Tor</a> is an encrypted anonymising network that makes it harder to intercept internet communications, or see where communications are coming from or going to.</p>
		<p>In order to use the WikiLeaks public submission system as detailed above you can download the Tor Browser Bundle, which is a Firefox-like browser available for Windows, Mac OS X and GNU/Linux and pre-configured to connect using the anonymising system Tor.</p>
		<h4>Tails</h4>
		<p>If you are at high risk and you have the capacity to do so, you can also access the submission system through a secure operating system called <a href="https://tails.boum.org">Tails</a>. Tails is an operating system launched from a USB stick or a DVD that aim to leaves no traces when the computer is shut down after use and automatically routes your internet traffic through Tor. Tails will require you to have either a USB stick or a DVD at least 4GB big and a laptop or desktop computer.</p>

		<h3>Tips</h3>
		<p>Our submission system works hard to preserve your anonymity, but we recommend you also take some of your own precautions. Please review these basic guidelines. </p>
		<div>
			<h4>1. Contact us if you have specific problems</h4>
			<p>If you have a very large submission, or a submission with a complex format, or are a high-risk source, please <a href="#submit_help_contact">contact us</a>. In our experience it is always possible to find a custom solution for even the most seemingly difficult situations.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h4>2. What computer to use</h4>
			<p>If the computer you are uploading from could subsequently be audited in an investigation, consider using a computer that is not easily tied to you. Technical users can also use <a href="https://tails.boum.org">Tails</a> to help ensure you do not leave any records of your submission on the computer.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h4>3. Do not talk about your submission to others</h4>
			<p>If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in source protection – it is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This includes other media organisations.</p>
		</div>

	</div>

		<h3>After</h3>

		<div>
			<h4>1. Do not talk about your submission to others</h4>
			<p>If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in source protection – it is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This includes other media organisations.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h4>2. Act normal</h4>
			<p>If you are a high-risk source, avoid saying anything or doing anything after submitting which might promote suspicion. In particular, you should try to stick to your normal routine and behaviour.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h4>3. Remove traces of your submission</h4>
			<p>If you are a high-risk source and the computer you prepared your submission on, or uploaded it from, could subsequently be audited in an investigation, we recommend that you format and dispose of the computer hard drive and any other storage media you used.</p>
			<p>In particular, hard drives retain data after formatting which may be visible to a digital forensics team and flash media (USB sticks, memory cards and SSD drives) retain data even after a secure erasure. If you used flash media to store sensitive data, it is important to destroy the media.</p>
			<p>If you do this and are a high-risk source you should make sure there are no traces of the clean-up, since such traces themselves may draw suspicion.</p>
			<div>
				<h4>4. If you face legal action</h4>
				<p>If a legal action is brought against you as a result of your submission, there are organisations that may help you. The Courage Foundation is an international organisation dedicated to the protection of journalistic sources. You can find more details at <a href="https://www.couragefound.org">https://www.couragefound.org</a>.</p>

		<p>WikiLeaks publishes documents of political or historical importance that are censored or otherwise suppressed. We specialise in strategic global publishing and large archives.</p>
		<p>The following is the address of our secure site where you can anonymously upload your documents to WikiLeaks editors. You can only access this submissions system through Tor. (See our <a href="#submit_help_tor">Tor tab</a> for more information.) We also advise you to read our <a href="#submit_help_tips">tips for sources</a> before submitting.</p>

			<!--<div>
				Copy this address into your Tor browser. Advanced users, if they wish, can also add a further layer of encryption to their submission using <a href="#submit_wlkey">our public PGP key</a>.
			</div>-->
		</div>

		<p>If you cannot use Tor, or your submission is very large, or you have specific requirements, WikiLeaks provides several alternative methods. <a href="#submit_help_contact">Contact us</a> to discuss how to proceed.</p>

NADA/ASSESSMENT/FEB 02/MFA WASHINGTON
ECONOMIC ANALYSIS: ALBANIA-CHINA: RIFT CAUSES TIRANA TO
GO IT ALONE
1. (C-ENTIRE TEXT).
2. BEGIN SUMMARY. THE FALLING-OUT BETWEEN THE ALBANIANS
AND THE CHINESE HAS LEFT TIRANA WITHOUT A BENEFACTOR FOR

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
THE FIRST TIME SINCE WORLD WAR II. CHINA'S TERMINATION
OF AID AND TRADE LAST SUMMER BROUGHT DIPLOMATIC TIES
BARELY SHORT OF THE BREAKING POINT AND FORMALLY BURIED
THE LONG-AILING &quot;ETERNAL&quot; ALLIANCE.
3. PEKING'S FINAL JETTISONING OF ITS TINY ALLY IN FAVOR
OF MORE IMPORTANT BALKAN ASSOCIATES WAS CLEARLY SIGNALED
BY CHAIRMAN HUA'S SUBSEQUENT TOUR OF ROMANIA AND
YUGOSLAVIA. IN ALBANIAN EYES, THE CHINESE LEADERS HAVE
BECOME &quot;NEW REVISIONISTS&quot; AND &quot;SOCIAL IMPERIALISTS.&quot;
FOR THE MOMENT, THE PRC HAS SUPERSEDED THE US AND THE
USSR AS THE BUTT OF ALBANIAN PROPAGANDA BLASTS. THE
CHINESE HAVE MAINTAINED A POSTURE OF IGNORING THE
ALBANIAN ABUSES, WHICH FOR THEM ARE COMING FROM A VIRTUAL NON-COUNTRY.
4. WITH NOBODY IN SIGHT TO REPLACE ITS LATEST BENEFACTOR,
ALBANIA APPEARS TO STAND ALONE AGAINST THE WORLD. IT IS
NOW AT ODDS WITH ALL MAJOR POWERS. STALINIST LEADER
HOXHA, WHO SINCE MAO'S DEATH STYLES HIMSELF AS THE LAST
TRUE MARXIST-LENINIST, HAS CHOSEN TO FORGO ALL FOREIGN AID
RATHER THAN ALTER HIS RADICAL POLICIES AND &quot;PURE&quot; IDEOLOGY.
CONFIDENTIAL
PAGE 03

STATE 047489

5. BY CHOOSING TO GO IT ALONE, HOXHA HAS CAUSED NEW
ECONOMIC PROBLEMS FOR HIS COUNTRY AND HAS PUSHED IT INTO
UNPRECEDENTED INSECURITY. TIRANA'S BEHAVIOR DURING THE
MONTHS SINCE THE RIFT INDICATES THAT THE ALBANIAN
LEADERSHIP HOPES TO MUDDLE THROUGH BY RELYING ON ITS
OWN RESOURCES AND BY EXPANDING ECONOMIC AND CULTURAL
COLLABORATION WITH THOSE COUNTRIES IN THE WEST AND THE
THIRD WORLD DEFINED BY HOXHA AS &quot;WELL-INTENTIONED&quot;
TOWARD ALBANIA. AN ACCOMMODATION WITH THE UNITED STATES
OR THE USSR IS NOT LIKELY. END SUMMARY.
6. CHINA TERMINATES AID TO ALBANIA
7. IN A DIPLOMATIC NOTE TO THE ALBANIANS DATED JULY 7,
CHINA CLAIMED THAT DESPITE ITS UNDERDEVELOPED STATUS AND
MANY ECONOMIC DIFFICULTIES, IT HAD:
(A)--GRANTED ALBANIA DOLS 5.3 BILLION IN AID SINCE 1954
(NOTE: THIS PROBABLY INFLATED FIGURE MAY INCLUDE GRATIS
MILITARY HARDWARE, AD HOC GRANTS-IN-AID, AND THE COST OF
CHINESE TECHNICIANS AND ALBANIAN TRAINEES. AT ANY RATE,
LONG-TERM, INTEREST-FREE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTAL CREDITS
CONTRACTED FOR UNDER THE FOUR FIVE-YEAR PLANS, 1961-80,
HAVE BEEN ESTIMATED AT AROUND DOLS 1.1 BILLION: 1961-65,
DOLS 146 MILLION; 1966-70, DOLS 207 MILLION; 1971-75,
DOLS 485 MILLION; AND 1976-80, DOLS 263 MILLION);

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
(B)--AGREED TO THE ALBANIANS' REQUEST THAT REPAYMENT OF
THE DEBT BE POSTPONED UNTIL THE PERIOD 1991-2000; AND
(C)--AGREED TO HELP ALBANIA BUILD 142 COMPLETE PROJECTS,
OF WHICH 91 WERE FINISHED, 23 WERE ALMOST FINISHED, AND
17 WERE UNDER SURVEY OR BEING DESIGNED. (THE NOTE
SAID THAT NEARLY 6,000 CHINESE EXPERTS HAD SERVED ON AID
PROJECTS IN ALBANIA, WHILE MORE THAN 2,000 ALBANIAN
ECONOMIC AND MILITARY CADRES HAD TRAINED IN CHINA.)
CONFIDENTIAL
PAGE 04

STATE 047489

THE CHINESE NOTE ALSO COMPLAINED ABOUT EVER-INCREASING
ALBANIAN DEMANDS AND SAID THAT CHINA &quot;COULD NOT GIVE WHATEVER TIRANA WANTED WHENEVER IT WANTED IT.&quot;
8. THE CHINESE PUT THE ENTIRE BLAME ON THE ALBANIAN SIDE.
THEY CHARGED THAT THE ALBANIAN LEADERSHIP HAD PURSUED AN
ANTI-CHINA COURSE, DELIBERATELY ABANDONED ECONOMIC AGREEMENTS, SLANDERED CHINESE EXPERTS, AND SABOTAGED COLLABORATION IN A SYSTEMATIC WAY THAT MADE THE AID PROGRAM
IMPOSSIBLE TO OPERATE. ALL OF THIS, THE NOTE STATED,
GAVE THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT NO CHOICE BUT TO TERMINATE
ITS PROGRAM AND RECALL ITS EXPERTS.
9. BACKDROP TO THE RIFT
10. THE CHINESE ANNOUNCEMENT WAS NOT UNEXPECTED. FOR
SEVERAL YEARS THERE HAD BEEN INDICATIONS THAT THE PRC
TURNED AID, AND PROBABLY TRADE, OFF AND ON TO SIGNAL ITS
DISPLEASURE WITH ALBANIAN POLICIES. THE DECISION TO
TERMINATE PROBABLY REFLECTS THE INFLUENCE, AND NO DOUBT
PIQUE, OF VICE PREMIER TENG HSIAO-P'ING. TENG, IN HOXHA'S
EYES, IS A CONTEMPTIBLE HERETIC AND ALBANIA'S NO. 1 ENEMY
IN THE CHINESE HIERARCHY. IT WAS NO COINCIDENCE THAT THE
CHINESE NOTE WAS DELIVERED ONE YEAR TO THE DAY AFTER AN
ALBANIAN PARTY EDITORIAL PUBLICLY ATTACKED MAO'S &quot;THREE
WORLDS THEORY,&quot; WHICH TENG HAS STRONGLY PROPAGATED AS THE
CHINESE PARTY'S LINE. (THE NOTE TO THE ALBANIANS FOLLOWED
BY ONLY FOUR DAYS A SIMILAR ACTION, ALSO PROBABLY INSPIRED
BY TENG, VIS-A-VIS VIETNAM.)
11. THE SINO-ALBANIAN ALLIANCE WAS SEVERELY SHAKEN BY
PEKING'S RAPPROCHEMENT WITH THE US AND WESTERN EUROPE;
CONFIDENTIAL
PAGE 05

STATE 047489

IT DETERIORATED FURTHER IN THE FALL OF 1976, FOLLOWING
THE HUA-TENG VICTORY OVER THE &quot;GANG OF FOUR.&quot; APPARENTLY,
THE CHINESE HAD BEGUN TO DELAY DELIVERIES OF EQUIPMENT FOR
MAJOR INDUSTRIAL PROJECTS AND REDUCE TRADE IN THE EARLY
1970'S. UNDER THE ECONOMIC AGREEMENT SIGNED IN JULY 1975,

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
THEY CUT DEVELOPMENTAL CREDITS FOR THE ALBANIAN SIXTH
FIVE-YEAR PLAN (1976-80) BY ALMOST HALF AND ALSO REFUSED
TO UNDERWRITE ANY NEW PROJECTS.
12. THE DECREASE IN CHINESE AID--ESTIMATED IN 1970 BY
WESTERN EXPERTS TO AMOUNT TO ABOUT 8 PERCENT OF THE
ALBANIAN GROSS NATIONAL PRODUCT--WAS REFLECTED IN DELAYS
IN THE CONSTRUCTION OF MAJOR INDUSTRIAL PROJECTS, SUCH
AS THE ELBASAN METALLURGICAL COMBINE, AND SEVERAL YEARS
OF SUBPAR INDUSTRIAL PERFORMANCE. THE INDUSTRIAL GROWTH
TARGET SKIDDED FROM 10.4 PERCENT IN 1973 TO 7.6 PERCENT
IN 1974, 4.4 PERCENT IN 1975, AND 4.3 PERCENT IN 1976
AND WAS REPEATEDLY UNFULFILLED. INDUSTRIAL GROWTH UNDER
THE FIFTH FIVE-YEAR PLAN (1971-75) WAS ONLY 52 PERCENT
COMPARED WITH A 61-66 PERCENT TARGET. A LOWER TARGET,
41-44 PERCENT, WAS SET FOR THE 1976-80 PLAN.
13. AT THE SEVENTH ALBANIAN PARTY CONGRESS, NOVEMBER 1976,
HOXHA DECLARED IDEOLOGICAL WAR AGAINST PEKING BY A CAMPAIGN
TO WIN OVER THE LEFTIST MARXIST-LENINIST SPLINTER PARTIES.
ON JULY 7, 1977, AN EDITORIAL IN THE PARTY'S MAIN ORGAN,
ZERI I POPULLIT, ATTACKED THE &quot;THREE WORLDS THEORY&quot; AS AN
OPPORTUNISTIC DEVIATION FROM MARXISM-LENINISM AND AN
ABANDONMENT OF REVOLUTION IN FAVOR OF ALLIANCE WITH
IMPERIALISM AND REACTIONARIES. FINALLY, A JUNE 24, 1978,
EDITORIAL TITLED &quot;IMPERIALISTS: HANDS OFF VIETNAM&quot; SUPPORTED VIETNAM AGAINST CHINA AND CAMBODIA.
14. THE LATTER APPEARED TO EXCEED ALL BOUNDS OF CHINESE
TOLERANCE. A CONCOMITANT FACTOR PROMPTING THE FINAL
FALLING-OUT PROBABLY WAS PEKING'S DESIRE TO LIQUIDATE THE
ALBANIAN PROBLEM PRIOR TO HUA KUO-FENG'S VISIT TO ROMANIA

(AUGUST 16-21) AND YUGOSLAVIA (AUGUST 21-29).
15. TIRANA'S REBUTTAL
16. THE ALBANIAN REBUTTAL CAME IN A 56-PAGE LETTER OF
JULY 29 ADDRESSED TO THE CHINESE PARTY AND GOVERNMENT.
THE LETTER PLACED THE ENTIRE BLAME FOR THE RIFT ON PEKING
AND SOUGHT TO DENIGRATE THE CHINESE IN THE EYES OF THE
WORLD.
17. THE LETTER CHARGED THAT THE CHINESE HAD OFTEN BEEN
WRONG IN THE PAST AND CONTINUED TO BE GUILTY OF OPPORTUNISTIC DEVIATIONS AND ZIGZAG POLICIES, WHICH THE ALBANIANS
REFUSED TO FOLLOW. THE ALBANIANS CLAIMED THAT PEKING'S
ACTION STEMMED MAINLY FROM ITS RESENTMENT OF TIRANA'S
UNWILLINGNESS TO FOLLOW THE CHINESE LEAD, FOR EXAMPLE, ON
THE &quot;THREE WORLDS THEORY&quot; AND RAPPROCHEMENT WITH US
&quot;IMPERIALISM.&quot; STATE POWER IN CHINA, IT CHARGED, HAD
FALLEN INTO THE HANDS OF &quot;BOURGEOIS AND REVISIONIST ELE-

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
MENTS,&quot; WHICH SOUGHT TO MAKE CHINA A CENTRAL STATE POWER
AND DIVIDE THE WORLD INTO SPHERES OF INFLUENCE. THE
BALKAN PEOPLES WERE WARNED AGAINST CHINESE INTRIGUES IN
THE BALKANS: PEKING HAD UNITED WITH THE &quot;REVISIONIST&quot;
TITO TO TURN THE BALKANS AGAIN INTO A &quot;POWDER KEG.&quot;
18. THE ALBANIANS ALSO CONTROVERTED THE CHINESE FIGURE ON
AID AS INFLATED--&quot;AN ARBITRARY FIGURE WHICH DOES NOT
CORRESPOND TO THE TRUTH&quot;--AND QUESTIONED CHINESE MONETARY
CONVERSION PRACTICES. THEY SET THE TOTAL AID FIGURE AT
THE SUBSTANTIALLY LOWER AMOUNT OF DOLS 1.9 BILLION--OF
WHICH ONLY 75 PERCENT, I.E., DOLS 1.4 BILLION, HAD BEEN
DRAWN DOWN BY JULY 1978--A FIGURE REMARKABLY CLOSE TO
CONFIDENTIAL
PAGE 07

STATE 047489

WESTERN ESTIMATES.
19. THE LETTER DECLARED THAT ALBANIA WOULD NEVER ALLY
ITSELF WITH THE USSR AGAINST THE US, OR VICE VERSA, AND
WOULD FIGHT BOTH &quot;IMPERIALISMS&quot;--OBSERVING THAT CHINA
WITH ITS ZIGZAG COURSE, NOT ALBANIA, WAS CAPABLE OF
RECONCILIATION WITH THE USSR AT SOME FUTURE DATE. IT
STRESSED THAT ALBANIA WAS NOT ISOLATED AND WOULD CONTINUE
ITS INDEPENDENT POLICY AND RELY ON ITS OWN RESOURCES. THE
LETTER, WHILE NOT SPARING THE CHINESE THE WORST ALBANIAN
EPITHETS, MADE IT CLEAR THAT ALBANIA WOULD STRIVE TO
MAINTAIN NORMAL STATE RELATIONS WITH CHINA DESPITE THE
CHINESE LEADERSHIP'S EXTENSION OF IDEOLOGICAL DIFFERENCES
TO THE SPHERE OF STATE TIES. EVIDENTLY THE ALBANIANS
SOUGHT TO PUT THE ONUS FOR ANY POSSIBLE BREAK IN DIPLOMATIC
TIES ON THE CHINESE.
20. PROSPECTS OF MUDDLING THROUGH
21. THE SINO-ALBANIAN RIFT HAS AGAIN BROUGHT THE QUESTION
OF ALBANIA--WITH ITS STRATEGIC IONIAN AND ADRIATIC BASES
INSIDE THE NATO DEFENSE PERIMETER--BACK ONTO THE CENTER OF
THE INTERNATIONAL STAGE. IT HAS RAISED QUESTIONS OF THE
COUNTRY'S SURVIVAL, POLICIES, AND ORIENTATION.
22. THE ALBANIAN DUUMVIRATE OF HOXHA AND PREMIER SHEHU IS
WELL EXPERIENCED IN SURVIVING DIFFICULTIES. THEY APPEAR TO
THRIVE ON CRISIS. IN FACT, THEIR CONSTANT WARNINGS ABOUT
THE &quot;IMPERIALIST AND SOCIAL IMPERIALIST SAVAGE BLOCKADE
AND ENCIRCLEMENT&quot; ARE MEANT TO PERPETUATE A CRISIS-ANDSIEGE MENTALITY IN THE COUNTRY, TO ELICIT UNITY AND
SUPPORT.
23. THE TWO LEADERS SURVIVED THE ITALIAN AND GERMAN OCCUPATION DURING THE WAR (THE ONLY ONES WHO RECEIVED NO HELP
FROM SOVIET FORCES) AND SUBSEQUENTLY BROKE WIT;

THEIR YUGOSLAV MENTORS (IN 1948) AND SOVIET PATRONS (IN
1961). MOREOVER, THEY APPARENTLY HAVE BEEN ABLE TO
SURMOUNT SOME OF THE TROUBLES CAUSED SINCE 1974 BY
PEKING'S REDUCTION OF AND DELAYS IN DELIVERIES. THEY HAVE
BEEN ASSISTED BY THE FACT THAT THE PEOPLE OF ALBANIA HAVE
LONG BEEN CONDITIONED TO A LOW STANDARD OF LIVING AND DO
NOT YET SHARE THE RISING EXPECTATIONS PRESENT IN MORE
DEVELOPED LANDS.
24. A RUDIMENTARY ECONOMY
25. BECAUSE OF ALBANIA'S RAPID ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT SINCE
THE BREAK WITH THE SOVIETS IN 1961, IT IS TODAY IN A
STRONGER POSITION TO GO IT ALONE THAN AT ANY OTHER TIME
IN ITS HISTORY. AN ECONOMIC INFRASTRUCTURE HAS BEEN
ESTABLISHED AND, ALTHOUGH RUDIMENTARY, IT HAS BEEN ABLE
INCREASINGLY TO SATISFY THE NEEDS OF THE ECONOMY AND THE
PEOPLE. FOR INSTANCE, IT IS CLAIMED THAT:
(A)--THE MACHINE INDUSTRY PRODUCES 85 PERCENT OF ALBANIA'S
SPARE PARTS, WHILE THE LIGHT AND FOOD INDUSTRIES SUPPLY
90 PERCENT OF THE ECONOMY'S NEEDS;
(B)--ALBANIA HAS BEEN SELF-SUFFICIENT IN ELECTRICAL ENERGY,
WITH A SURPLUS FOR EXPORT; AND
(C)--AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION ACHIEVED SELF-SUFFICIENCY IN
BREADGRAINS IN 1976; IN 1977 NEEDS WERE FULLY COVERED
DESPITE A DAMAGING DROUGHT.
26. MOREOVER, THE ALBANIAN LEADERSHIP HAS NOT BEEN CAUGHT
NAPPING. IT HAS LONG ANTICIPATED THE CHINESE EMBARGO, AS
CONFIDENTIAL
PAGE 09

STATE 047489

INDICATED BY ALBANIA'S SIEGE ECONOMY AND THE INTENSIFICATION SEVERAL YEARS AGO OF THE &quot;SELF-RELIANCE&quot; CAMPAIGN.
THE REGIME HAS FOR SOME TIME BEEN ACCUMULATING RESERVES
OF GRAIN, ESSENTIAL RAW MATERIALS, AND MILITARY EQUIPMENT
AND SPARE PARTS.
27. THE CURRENT ECONOMIC POSITION MAY NOT BE ANY MORE
DIFFICULT THAN IN THE MID-1970'S. THE ALBANIAN PLANNERS
HAVE HAD SEVERAL YEARS TO ADJUST TO PROBLEMS CONNECTED
WITH CHINESE AID. BY 1977 THE ECONOMY APPEARED TO BE
BOUNCING BACK FROM THE NEGATIVE IMPACT OF REDUCED CHINESE
AID. THE INDUSTRIAL GROWTH RATE INCREASED TO 6.6 PERCENT,
SEVERAL POINTS OVER THE TWO PREVIOUS YEARS, A POSITIVE

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
DEVELOPMENT EVEN THOUGH THE TARGET OF 9.3 PERCENT WAS NOT
ACHIEVED. RELATIVELY HIGH GROWTH TARGETS WERE ALSO SET
FOR 1978, 8.5 PERCENT IN INDUSTRY AND 28 PERCENT IN
AGRICULTURE. ACCORDING TO THE LATEST INFORMATION,
INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION DURING THE JANUARY-AUGUST PERIOD
EXCEEDED PLANNED GROWTH BY 1.6 PERCENT AND CONSUMER GOODS
OVERFULFILLED THE PLAN BY 3.6 PERCENT. ALL THIS TENDS TO
SUGGEST THAT THE MAIN CONTRIBUTOR TO ALBANIAN ECONOMIC
GROWTH HAS BEEN A DETERMINED MOBILIZATION OF DOMESTIC
RESOURCES.
28. THE FOREIGN TRADE PROBLEM
29. ALBANIA DURING THE 1970'S HAS BEEN ABLE TO REGISTER
SOME PROGRESS IN EXPANDING ITS FOREIGN TRADE NETWORK. IT
NOW HAS MORE TRADE PARTNERS THAN EVER BEFORE. (NOTE: IN
1974, A LEADING FOREIGN TRADE OFFICIAL CLAIMED THAT
ALBANIA TRADED WITH 50 COUNTRIES.) UNDER THE FIFTH FIVEYEAR PLAN (1971-75), EXPORTS INCREASED BY 75 PERCENT OVER
THE PREVIOUS FIVE-YEAR PERIOD. IN 1970, ALBANIA'S TOTAL
FOREIGN TRADE TURNOVER WAS ESTIMATED TO CONSTITUTE ABOUT
37 PERCENT OF ITS GROSS NATIONAL PRODUCT. THIS PERCENTAGE,
CONFIDENTIAL
PAGE 10

STATE 047489

ONE OF THE HIGHEST AMONG BALKAN COUNTRIES, NO DOUBT HAS
INCREASED--TOTAL TRADE TURNOVER REGISTERED SIZABLE ANNUAL
GAINS THROUGH 1974. IN THAT YEAR, A RECORD HIGH OF MORE
THAN DOLS 500 MILLION WAS ACHIEVED. (THE DECLINE IN TOTAL
TRADE IN 1975 AND 1976 APPEARS ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE DROP IN
TRADE WITH CHINA AND A STRICT REGIME OF REDUCING IMPORTS.)
30. DURING THE 1970'S, ALBANIA'S PATTERN OF FOREIGN TRADE
WAS HIGHLIGHTED BY A SIGNIFICANT SHIFT--A STRONGER ORIENTATION TOWARD WEST EUROPEAN AND OTHER FREE WORLD COUNTRIES.
DURING THE 1971-75 PERIOD, MORE THAN THREE QUARTERS OF ALL
TRADE WAS WITH CHINA AND THE CEMA (COUNCIL FOR MUTUAL
ECONOMIC ASSISTANCE) MEMBER-COUNTRIES. NEVERTHELESS,
THERE WAS A NOTABLE ANNUAL INCREASE IN TURNOVER WITH
THE FREE WORLD--ALMOST FIVEFOLD--AS A RESULT OF A CONCERTED
DRIVE IN THIS DIRECTION IN THE EARLY 1970'S. FOR INSTANCE,
IN 1970 CHINA'S AND CEMA'S SHARE OF ALBANIAN TRADE TURNOVER WAS 54 AND 33 PERCENT RESPECTIVELY, WHILE THE FREE
WORLD ACCOUNTED FOR ONLY 13 PERCENT. BY 1975 THE FREE
WORLD'S SHARE HAD INCREASED TO 33.2 PERCENT--EXCEEDING
SLIGHTLY THAT OF CEMA (32.9 PERCENT) AND ALMOST EQUALING
THAT OF CHINA, WHICH DIPPED TO 33.9 PERCENT.
31. THIS DIVERSIFICATION ACHIEVED A VIRTUAL BALANCE
BETWEEN THE THREE TRADING AREAS. ALBANIA'S &quot;OPENING&quot;
TOWARD THE FREE WORLD MEANT NOT ONLY THAT ALBANIA HAD
CONSOLIDATED A FUTURE TRADING BASE THERE BUT ALSO THAT

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
IT HAD ACHIEVED A MARKED REDUCTION IN ITS DEPENDENCE ON
TRADE WITH THE COMMUNIST AREAS.
32. THE ALBANIAN LEADERSHIP IS FACED WITH THE PROBLEM OF
COMPENSATING FOR THE LOSS OF CHINESE AID AND TRADE, FINDING
MARKETS FOR GOODS ONCE DESTINED FOR CHINA, AND FINDING THE
CONFIDENTIAL
PAGE 11

STATE 047489

HARD CURRENCY TO BUY THE EQUIPMENT FOR DEVELOPMENTAL
PROJECTS. A NEW PATRON TO REPLACE CHINA APPEARS TO BE
OUT OF THE QUESTION, AT LEAST IN THE IMMEDIATE FUTURE.
FIRST, HOXHA MIGHT FEEL HE HAS HAD A SURFEIT OF PATRONS;
SECOND, THERE IS NO COUNTRY THAT FITS THE BILL FINANCIALLY
OR IDEOLOGICALLY. CONSTITUTIONAL ARTICLE 28--HOXHA'S
BRAINCHILD--PROHIBITS CREDITS FROM &quot;CAPITALIST, BOURGEOIS
AND REVISIONIST MONOPOLIES AND STATES.&quot; THIS RESTRICTION
APPARENTLY DOES NOT RULE OUT SHORT-TERM PRIVATE COMMERCIAL
CREDITS OR TRADE CREDITS FROM CEMA COUNTRIES. THE
ALBANIANS COULD RELY MORE HEAVILY ON SUCH FINANCING IN
THE FUTURE.
33. THE ALBANIANS ARE MAKING STRONG EFFORTS TO FIND
ALTERNATE MARKETS FOR THEIR FORMER EXPORTS TO CHINA.
(NOTE: AMONG THE PRODUCTS EXPORTED TO CHINA WERE:
CHROMITE, FERRO-NICKEL ORE, BLISTER COPPER AND COPPER
PRODUCTS, CRUDE OIL, BITUMEN, PLYWOOD, COTTON FABRICS,
LEAF TOBACCO, AND CIGARETTES.) THEIR DIFFICULTIES ARE NOT
NEW; THEY HAD TO DO THE SAME THING WHEN ALBANIA BROKE
WITH THE USSR IN 1961. MOREOVER, THE DIFFICULTIES HAVE
BEEN MADE LESS FORMIDABLE BECAUSE NEW MARKETS HAVE
ALREADY BEEN FOUND AS A RESULT OF THE EXPORT DRIVE OVER
THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS. INDEED, THIS EXPORT DRIVE MAY
HAVE BEEN PARTLY PROMPTED BY CHINA'S REDUCTION OF IMPORTS
FROM ALBANIA.
34. THE ALBANIANS' ATTEMPTS TO SOLVE THEIR FOREIGN TRADE
PROBLEMS HAVE LED TO THE FOLLOWING DEVELOPMENTS:
(A)--A TRADE DELEGATION TO DENMARK IN MARCH 1978 (RECIPROCATING A DANISH DELEGATION TO ALBANIA IN SEPTEMBER 1977);
(B)--AN ITALIAN INDUSTRIAL MISSION TO ALBANIA LAST MARCH;
CONFIDENTIAL
PAGE 12

STATE 047489

(C)--A TURKISH TRADE DELEGATION TO ALBANIA LAST MAY AIMED
AT INCREASING THE VOLUME OF TRADE;
(D)--THE FIRST TRADE AGREEMENT WITH MEXICO, IN AUGUST;

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
(E)--THE FIRST TRADE EXHIBIT AT THE MALMO INTERNATIONAL
FAIR (SWEDEN), ALSO IN AUGUST;
(F)--AN ECONOMIC DELEGATION TO INDIA, JULY 29-AUGUST 6,
WHICH VISITED SEVERAL INDUSTRIAL CENTERS;
(G)--AN 18-MEMBER SWISS BUSINESS DELEGATION WHICH VISITED
TIRANA IN SEPTEMBER;
(H)--A VISIT BY FOREIGN TRADE MINISTER NEDIN HOXHA TO THE
ALGIERS INTERNATIONAL FAIR IN SEPTEMBER;
(I)--A DELEGATION OF THE AUSTRIAN CHAMBER OF COMMERCE WHICH
VISITED TIRANA IN NOVEMBER; AND
(J)--A TRADE DELEGATION UNDER FOREIGN TRADE MINISTER HOXHA
WHICH VISITED SWEDEN AND FINLAND IN NOVEMBER.
35. THE ALBANIANS HAVE ALSO APPROACHED AUSTRIA AND OTHER
&quot;NON-SUPERPOWER&quot; COUNTRIES FOR INDUSTRIAL MATERIALS AND
PLANTS, WHICH THEY HAVE OFFERED TO PAY FOR IN CASH OR
SUCH INDUSTRIAL RAW MATERIALS AS CHROME AND FERRO-NICKEL
ORES. THERE HAVE BEEN EFFORTS IN RECENT MONTHS TO INCREASE
TRADE WITH FRANCE, ITALY, GREECE, THE SCANDINAVIAN COUNTRIES, AND SWITZERLAND. BUT THERE HAVE BEEN NO RESPONSES
TO MOSCOW'S OVERTURES FOR TIES. THE PROBLEM OF ALTERNATE
MARKETS APPEARS YET TO BE RESOLVED--PERHAPS PARTLY BECAUSE
WESTERN COUNTRIES STILL DO NOT EXHIBIT MUCH INTEREST IN
CONFIDENTIAL
PAGE 13

STATE 047489

ALBANIA. ON THE POSITIVE SIDE, HOWEVER, THE ALBANIANS
CLAIMED IN 1977 THAT THEIR EXPORT PLAN WAS BEING FULFILLED
AND ALSO ANNOUNCED THAT THE EXPORT TARGET SET FOR 1978 WAS
HIGHER THAN THAT OF THE PREVIOUS YEAR.
36. NEW BID TOWARD &quot;GOOD&quot; WESTERN COUNTRIES
37. THERE APPEARS TO BE NO PROSPECT OF A BASIC CHANGE IN
ALBANIA'S FOREIGN POLICY POSTURE OR ORIENTATION. HOXHA
HAS NOT MADE ANY PRECIPITOUS MOVES, DESPITE THE HARD
REALITY OF ALBANIA NOW FINDING ITSELF AT ODDS WITH ALL
MAJOR POWERS. THE RIFT WITH THE &quot;NEW CHINESE REVISIONISTS&quot;
HAS HAD BUT MINIMAL EFFECT ON THE REGIME'S FOREIGN POLICY
LINE AND INITIATIVES. THE ALBANIAN PARTY HAS APPARENTLY
STEPPED UP CONTACTS WITH THE MARXIST-LENINIST SPLINTER
GROUPS, OVER A DOZEN OF WHICH IT MANAGED (AFTER 1976) TO
ORGANIZE INTO AN INFORMAL &quot;INTERNATIONAL&quot; ATTACKING
PEKING'S &quot;THREE WORLDS THEORY&quot; AND ECHOING ALBANIA'S
ANTI-CHINA POLEMICS. THEN LAST JUNE, AFTER STRADDLING
THE FENCE, THE ALBANIANS CAME OUT IN FULL SUPPORT OF
VIETNAM AGAINST CHINA, DESPITE HANOI'S PRO-SOVIET
ORIENTATION.

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014

38. THE MOST SIGNIFICANT REACTION TO THE RIFT PERHAPS HAS
BEEN THE STRONGEST ALBANIAN PITCH TOWARD THE &quot;BOURGEOIS&quot;
WORLD SINCE THE END OF 1976, WHEN HOXHA OFFERED HIS HAND
TO A SELECT NUMBER OF SMALL- AND MEDIUM-SIZED STATES OF
THE WEST. ON SEPTEMBER 20, 1978, THE ALBANIAN LEADER
POINTED OUT THAT ALBANIA:
(A)--&quot;DULY DISTINGUISHES BETWEEN THOSE VARIOUS BOURGEOIS
STATES WHICH ARE PROGRESSIVE AND WELL-DISPOSED TO IT,&quot; AND
(B)--WANTED TO MAINTAIN FRIENDLY ECONOMIC AND CULTURAL
RELATIONS WITH &quot;ALL THOSE STATES, LARGE OR SMALL, WHICH
RESPECT THE PEOPLE'S SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF ALBANIA.&quot;
CONFIDENTIAL
PAGE 14

STATE 047489

39. AT THE TOP OF THE LATTER LIST APPEAR TO BE FRANCE,
WHICH HOXHA, A PRODUCT OF FRENCH SCHOOLS, FAVORS, AND
GREECE, WHICH IN HIS EYES HAS ALREADY TRAVERSED THE PATH
FROM ENEMY TO CLOSE (POSSIBLY CLOSEST) FRIEND. THE
ALBANIANS HAVE ALSO MADE BIDS TO ITALY, AUSTRIA, TURKEY,
THE LOW COUNTRIES, SWITZERLAND, AND SCANDINAVIA. SOME
POSSIBLE CANDIDATES OUTSIDE EUROPE ARE CANADA, INDIA,
JAPAN, AND ALGERIA.
40. THE THRUST TOWARD WESTERN EUROPE HAS POSSIBLY BEEN
MADE BECAUSE THE ALBANIANS FEEL THAT THEY CAN INCREASINGLY
SATISFY A LARGE PART OF THEIR ECONOMIC AND TECHNOLOGICAL
NEEDS THERE WITHOUT THE DANGER OF INTERFERENCE IN THEIR
DOMESTIC AFFAIRS.
41. CONTINUED HOSTILITY TOWARD THE US AND THE USSR
42. HOXHA HAS NOT CHANGED HIS STANCE TOWARD STATES WITH AN
ALLEGED RECORD OF ENMITY TOWARD ALBANIA. THERE HAVE BEEN
NO EVIDENT MOVES TOWARD ESTABLISHMENT OF DIPLOMATIC TIES
WITH THE TWO SUPERPOWERS. BOTH &quot;US IMPERIALISM&quot; AND
&quot;SOVIET SOCIAL IMPERIALISM&quot; REMAIN THE MAIN TARGETS OF
THE ALBANIAN LEADERS' ATTACKS AND CONTINUE TO BE REGARDED
AS &quot;EQUALLY DANGEROUS AND AGGRESSIVE.&quot; HOXHA EMPHASIZED
IN HIS SEPTEMBER 20 SPEECH THAT &quot;NOBODY SHOULD CHERISH
THE SLIGHTEST ILLUSION&quot; THAT ALBANIA WOULD CHANGE ITS
STAND TOWARD SOVIET &quot;SOCIAL IMPERIALISM.&quot; TIRANA HAS
IGNORED THE CALLS FOR &quot;NORMALIZATION&quot; OF TIES FROM THE
USSR, AS WELL AS FROM THE LATTER'S SURROGATE, BULGARIA,
EVEN THOUGH HAPPENSTANCE HAS PLACED ALL THREE COUNTRIES
IN THE SAME BOAT DENOUNCING PEKING'S LINE AND POLICIES.

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
43. DESPITE THE FACT THAT THE EAST EUROPEAN COUNTRIES ARE
ALBANIA'S TRADITIONAL AND MAJOR TRADING PARTNERS, THE
ALBANIAN GOVERNMENT DOES NOT APPEAR INTENT ON RETURNING
ITS AMBASSADORS, AFTER AN ABSENCE OF 17 YEARS, TO SOFIA,
BUDAPEST, PRAGUE, WARSAW, AND EAST BERLIN: THEIR GOVERNMENTS ARE &quot;REVISIONISTS&quot; AND &quot;VASSALS&quot; OF THE KREMLIN.
NEITHER DOES IT APPEAR INCLINED TO ESTABLISH DIPLOMATIC
TIES WITH &quot;IMPERIALIST&quot; BRITAIN AND &quot;REVANCHIST&quot; WEST
GERMANY, AT LEAST NOT UNTIL ALBANIA'S MONETARY CLAIMS
AGAINST THEM ARE SATISFIED. HOSTILITY TOWARD MOST OF
THESE COUNTRIES IS LIKELY TO CONTINUE AS LONG AS HOXHA
AND SHEHU REMAIN IN AUTHORITY.
44. REGIME REMAINS STABLE
45. THE OPEN DISPUTE WITH CHINA HAS PRODUCED NO PRECIPITOUS OR EXTREME MOVES DOMESTICALLY. IN ANTICIPATION OF THE
CHINESE MOVES, THE REGIME EARLY IN THE YEAR INTENSIFIED
AUSTERITY BY FURTHER BELT-TIGHTENING MEASURES, SUCH AS
THE DECREED 10-PERCENT CUT IN CONSUMPTION LEVELS. IT
ALSO INCREASED THE PRESSURE ON WORKERS TO INCREASE PRODUCTIVITY, UTILIZE RESERVES MORE EFFICIENTLY, REDUCE
WASTE IN THE ECONOMY, AND WORK HARDER TOWARD ULTIMATE
COMPLETION OF UNFINISHED PROJECTS.
46. RECENT TRAVELERS TO ALBANIA HAVE INDICATED THAT THE
SUPPLY OF FOOD WAS ADEQUATE, ALTHOUGH SOME PINCH IN AVAILABILITY OF CONSUMER GOODS WAS APPARENT. REPORTS OF NEW
PURGES, PURPORTEDLY OF PRO-CHINESE ELEMENTS, HAVE NOT
BEEN CONFIRMED. THERE IS WIDESPREAD EVIDENCE OF MANNED
PILLBOXES, NO DOUBT A DEVICE TO IMPART THE SENSE OF
CRISIS AND URGENCY TO A POPULACE PROBABLY CONFUSED OVER
THE CHINESE RIFT.
47. THE HOXHA-SHEHU DUUMVIRATE APPEARS AS STRONGLY
CONFIDENTIAL
PAGE 16

STATE 047489

ENTRENCHED AS EVER. THROUGH MASSIVE PURGES DURING
1973-75 IT QUASHED ALL OPPOSITION TO ITS POLICIES. IT
APPEARS TO HAVE FORGED A REJUVENATED, MORE OBEDIENT
HIERARCHY--AND, MOST IMPORTANTLY, TO HAVE BROUGHT THE
FORMERLY ASSERTIVE AND PROBABLY &quot;PRO-CHINESE&quot; DEFENSE
ESTABLISHMENT UNDER ITS DIRECT CONTROL. THE LEADERSHIP,
WHICH IS TRYING TO MAKE CAPITAL OUT OF ITS &quot;HEROIC&quot;
DEFIANCE OF ANOTHER &quot;TREASONOUS&quot; PATRON, MAY HAVE EVEN
REKINDLED THE PATRIOTISM OF A WEARY, DOCILE, AND DISCONTENTED POPULACE TO HELP IT IN ITS LATEST TIME OF
TROUBLES. VANCE

GO IT ALONE
1. (C-ENTIRE TEXT).
2. BEGIN SUMMARY. THE FALLING-OUT BETWEEN THE ALBANIANS
AND THE CHINESE HAS LEFT TIRANA WITHOUT A BENEFACTOR FOR

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
THE FIRST TIME SINCE WORLD WAR II. CHINA'S TERMINATION
OF AID AND TRADE LAST SUMMER BROUGHT DIPLOMATIC TIES
BARELY SHORT OF THE BREAKING POINT AND FORMALLY BURIED
THE LONG-AILING &quot;ETERNAL&quot; ALLIANCE.
3. PEKING'S FINAL JETTISONING OF ITS TINY ALLY IN FAVOR
OF MORE IMPORTANT BALKAN ASSOCIATES WAS CLEARLY SIGNALED
BY CHAIRMAN HUA'S SUBSEQUENT TOUR OF ROMANIA AND
YUGOSLAVIA. IN ALBANIAN EYES, THE CHINESE LEADERS HAVE
BECOME &quot;NEW REVISIONISTS&quot; AND &quot;SOCIAL IMPERIALISTS.&quot;
FOR THE MOMENT, THE PRC HAS SUPERSEDED THE US AND THE
USSR AS THE BUTT OF ALBANIAN PROPAGANDA BLASTS. THE
CHINESE HAVE MAINTAINED A POSTURE OF IGNORING THE
ALBANIAN ABUSES, WHICH FOR THEM ARE COMING FROM A VIRTUAL NON-COUNTRY.
4. WITH NOBODY IN SIGHT TO REPLACE ITS LATEST BENEFACTOR,
ALBANIA APPEARS TO STAND ALONE AGAINST THE WORLD. IT IS
NOW AT ODDS WITH ALL MAJOR POWERS. STALINIST LEADER
HOXHA, WHO SINCE MAO'S DEATH STYLES HIMSELF AS THE LAST
TRUE MARXIST-LENINIST, HAS CHOSEN TO FORGO ALL FOREIGN AID
RATHER THAN ALTER HIS RADICAL POLICIES AND &quot;PURE&quot; IDEOLOGY.
CONFIDENTIAL
PAGE 03

STATE 047489

5. BY CHOOSING TO GO IT ALONE, HOXHA HAS CAUSED NEW
ECONOMIC PROBLEMS FOR HIS COUNTRY AND HAS PUSHED IT INTO
UNPRECEDENTED INSECURITY. TIRANA'S BEHAVIOR DURING THE
MONTHS SINCE THE RIFT INDICATES THAT THE ALBANIAN
LEADERSHIP HOPES TO MUDDLE THROUGH BY RELYING ON ITS
OWN RESOURCES AND BY EXPANDING ECONOMIC AND CULTURAL
COLLABORATION WITH THOSE COUNTRIES IN THE WEST AND THE
THIRD WORLD DEFINED BY HOXHA AS &quot;WELL-INTENTIONED&quot;
TOWARD ALBANIA. AN ACCOMMODATION WITH THE UNITED STATES
OR THE USSR IS NOT LIKELY. END SUMMARY.
6. CHINA TERMINATES AID TO ALBANIA
7. IN A DIPLOMATIC NOTE TO THE ALBANIANS DATED JULY 7,
CHINA CLAIMED THAT DESPITE ITS UNDERDEVELOPED STATUS AND
MANY ECONOMIC DIFFICULTIES, IT HAD:
(A)--GRANTED ALBANIA DOLS 5.3 BILLION IN AID SINCE 1954
(NOTE: THIS PROBABLY INFLATED FIGURE MAY INCLUDE GRATIS
MILITARY HARDWARE, AD HOC GRANTS-IN-AID, AND THE COST OF
CHINESE TECHNICIANS AND ALBANIAN TRAINEES. AT ANY RATE,
LONG-TERM, INTEREST-FREE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTAL CREDITS
CONTRACTED FOR UNDER THE FOUR FIVE-YEAR PLANS, 1961-80,
HAVE BEEN ESTIMATED AT AROUND DOLS 1.1 BILLION: 1961-65,
DOLS 146 MILLION; 1966-70, DOLS 207 MILLION; 1971-75,
DOLS 485 MILLION; AND 1976-80, DOLS 263 MILLION);

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
(B)--AGREED TO THE ALBANIANS' REQUEST THAT REPAYMENT OF
THE DEBT BE POSTPONED UNTIL THE PERIOD 1991-2000; AND
(C)--AGREED TO HELP ALBANIA BUILD 142 COMPLETE PROJECTS,
OF WHICH 91 WERE FINISHED, 23 WERE ALMOST FINISHED, AND
17 WERE UNDER SURVEY OR BEING DESIGNED. (THE NOTE
SAID THAT NEARLY 6,000 CHINESE EXPERTS HAD SERVED ON AID
PROJECTS IN ALBANIA, WHILE MORE THAN 2,000 ALBANIAN
ECONOMIC AND MILITARY CADRES HAD TRAINED IN CHINA.)
CONFIDENTIAL
PAGE 04

STATE 047489

THE CHINESE NOTE ALSO COMPLAINED ABOUT EVER-INCREASING
ALBANIAN DEMANDS AND SAID THAT CHINA &quot;COULD NOT GIVE WHATEVER TIRANA WANTED WHENEVER IT WANTED IT.&quot;
8. THE CHINESE PUT THE ENTIRE BLAME ON THE ALBANIAN SIDE.
THEY CHARGED THAT THE ALBANIAN LEADERSHIP HAD PURSUED AN
ANTI-CHINA COURSE, DELIBERATELY ABANDONED ECONOMIC AGREEMENTS, SLANDERED CHINESE EXPERTS, AND SABOTAGED COLLABORATION IN A SYSTEMATIC WAY THAT MADE THE AID PROGRAM
IMPOSSIBLE TO OPERATE. ALL OF THIS, THE NOTE STATED,
GAVE THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT NO CHOICE BUT TO TERMINATE
ITS PROGRAM AND RECALL ITS EXPERTS.
9. BACKDROP TO THE RIFT
10. THE CHINESE ANNOUNCEMENT WAS NOT UNEXPECTED. FOR
SEVERAL YEARS THERE HAD BEEN INDICATIONS THAT THE PRC
TURNED AID, AND PROBABLY TRADE, OFF AND ON TO SIGNAL ITS
DISPLEASURE WITH ALBANIAN POLICIES. THE DECISION TO
TERMINATE PROBABLY REFLECTS THE INFLUENCE, AND NO DOUBT
PIQUE, OF VICE PREMIER TENG HSIAO-P'ING. TENG, IN HOXHA'S
EYES, IS A CONTEMPTIBLE HERETIC AND ALBANIA'S NO. 1 ENEMY
IN THE CHINESE HIERARCHY. IT WAS NO COINCIDENCE THAT THE
CHINESE NOTE WAS DELIVERED ONE YEAR TO THE DAY AFTER AN
ALBANIAN PARTY EDITORIAL PUBLICLY ATTACKED MAO'S &quot;THREE
WORLDS THEORY,&quot; WHICH TENG HAS STRONGLY PROPAGATED AS THE
CHINESE PARTY'S LINE. (THE NOTE TO THE ALBANIANS FOLLOWED
BY ONLY FOUR DAYS A SIMILAR ACTION, ALSO PROBABLY INSPIRED
BY TENG, VIS-A-VIS VIETNAM.)
11. THE SINO-ALBANIAN ALLIANCE WAS SEVERELY SHAKEN BY
PEKING'S RAPPROCHEMENT WITH THE US AND WESTERN EUROPE;
CONFIDENTIAL
PAGE 05

STATE 047489

IT DETERIORATED FURTHER IN THE FALL OF 1976, FOLLOWING
THE HUA-TENG VICTORY OVER THE &quot;GANG OF FOUR.&quot; APPARENTLY,
THE CHINESE HAD BEGUN TO DELAY DELIVERIES OF EQUIPMENT FOR
MAJOR INDUSTRIAL PROJECTS AND REDUCE TRADE IN THE EARLY
1970'S. UNDER THE ECONOMIC AGREEMENT SIGNED IN JULY 1975,

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
THEY CUT DEVELOPMENTAL CREDITS FOR THE ALBANIAN SIXTH
FIVE-YEAR PLAN (1976-80) BY ALMOST HALF AND ALSO REFUSED
TO UNDERWRITE ANY NEW PROJECTS.
12. THE DECREASE IN CHINESE AID--ESTIMATED IN 1970 BY
WESTERN EXPERTS TO AMOUNT TO ABOUT 8 PERCENT OF THE
ALBANIAN GROSS NATIONAL PRODUCT--WAS REFLECTED IN DELAYS
IN THE CONSTRUCTION OF MAJOR INDUSTRIAL PROJECTS, SUCH
AS THE ELBASAN METALLURGICAL COMBINE, AND SEVERAL YEARS
OF SUBPAR INDUSTRIAL PERFORMANCE. THE INDUSTRIAL GROWTH
TARGET SKIDDED FROM 10.4 PERCENT IN 1973 TO 7.6 PERCENT
IN 1974, 4.4 PERCENT IN 1975, AND 4.3 PERCENT IN 1976
AND WAS REPEATEDLY UNFULFILLED. INDUSTRIAL GROWTH UNDER
THE FIFTH FIVE-YEAR PLAN (1971-75) WAS ONLY 52 PERCENT
COMPARED WITH A 61-66 PERCENT TARGET. A LOWER TARGET,
41-44 PERCENT, WAS SET FOR THE 1976-80 PLAN.
13. AT THE SEVENTH ALBANIAN PARTY CONGRESS, NOVEMBER 1976,
HOXHA DECLARED IDEOLOGICAL WAR AGAINST PEKING BY A CAMPAIGN
TO WIN OVER THE LEFTIST MARXIST-LENINIST SPLINTER PARTIES.
ON JULY 7, 1977, AN EDITORIAL IN THE PARTY'S MAIN ORGAN,
ZERI I POPULLIT, ATTACKED THE &quot;THREE WORLDS THEORY&quot; AS AN
OPPORTUNISTIC DEVIATION FROM MARXISM-LENINISM AND AN
ABANDONMENT OF REVOLUTION IN FAVOR OF ALLIANCE WITH
IMPERIALISM AND REACTIONARIES. FINALLY, A JUNE 24, 1978,
EDITORIAL TITLED &quot;IMPERIALISTS: HANDS OFF VIETNAM&quot; SUPPORTED VIETNAM AGAINST CHINA AND CAMBODIA.
14. THE LATTER APPEARED TO EXCEED ALL BOUNDS OF CHINESE
TOLERANCE. A CONCOMITANT FACTOR PROMPTING THE FINAL
FALLING-OUT PROBABLY WAS PEKING'S DESIRE TO LIQUIDATE THE
ALBANIAN PROBLEM PRIOR TO HUA KUO-FENG'S VISIT TO ROMANIA

(AUGUST 16-21) AND YUGOSLAVIA (AUGUST 21-29).
15. TIRANA'S REBUTTAL
16. THE ALBANIAN REBUTTAL CAME IN A 56-PAGE LETTER OF
JULY 29 ADDRESSED TO THE CHINESE PARTY AND GOVERNMENT.
THE LETTER PLACED THE ENTIRE BLAME FOR THE RIFT ON PEKING
AND SOUGHT TO DENIGRATE THE CHINESE IN THE EYES OF THE
WORLD.
17. THE LETTER CHARGED THAT THE CHINESE HAD OFTEN BEEN
WRONG IN THE PAST AND CONTINUED TO BE GUILTY OF OPPORTUNISTIC DEVIATIONS AND ZIGZAG POLICIES, WHICH THE ALBANIANS
REFUSED TO FOLLOW. THE ALBANIANS CLAIMED THAT PEKING'S
ACTION STEMMED MAINLY FROM ITS RESENTMENT OF TIRANA'S
UNWILLINGNESS TO FOLLOW THE CHINESE LEAD, FOR EXAMPLE, ON
THE &quot;THREE WORLDS THEORY&quot; AND RAPPROCHEMENT WITH US
&quot;IMPERIALISM.&quot; STATE POWER IN CHINA, IT CHARGED, HAD
FALLEN INTO THE HANDS OF &quot;BOURGEOIS AND REVISIONIST ELE-

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
MENTS,&quot; WHICH SOUGHT TO MAKE CHINA A CENTRAL STATE POWER
AND DIVIDE THE WORLD INTO SPHERES OF INFLUENCE. THE
BALKAN PEOPLES WERE WARNED AGAINST CHINESE INTRIGUES IN
THE BALKANS: PEKING HAD UNITED WITH THE &quot;REVISIONIST&quot;
TITO TO TURN THE BALKANS AGAIN INTO A &quot;POWDER KEG.&quot;
18. THE ALBANIANS ALSO CONTROVERTED THE CHINESE FIGURE ON
AID AS INFLATED--&quot;AN ARBITRARY FIGURE WHICH DOES NOT
CORRESPOND TO THE TRUTH&quot;--AND QUESTIONED CHINESE MONETARY
CONVERSION PRACTICES. THEY SET THE TOTAL AID FIGURE AT
THE SUBSTANTIALLY LOWER AMOUNT OF DOLS 1.9 BILLION--OF
WHICH ONLY 75 PERCENT, I.E., DOLS 1.4 BILLION, HAD BEEN
DRAWN DOWN BY JULY 1978--A FIGURE REMARKABLY CLOSE TO
CONFIDENTIAL
PAGE 07

STATE 047489

WESTERN ESTIMATES.
19. THE LETTER DECLARED THAT ALBANIA WOULD NEVER ALLY
ITSELF WITH THE USSR AGAINST THE US, OR VICE VERSA, AND
WOULD FIGHT BOTH &quot;IMPERIALISMS&quot;--OBSERVING THAT CHINA
WITH ITS ZIGZAG COURSE, NOT ALBANIA, WAS CAPABLE OF
RECONCILIATION WITH THE USSR AT SOME FUTURE DATE. IT
STRESSED THAT ALBANIA WAS NOT ISOLATED AND WOULD CONTINUE
ITS INDEPENDENT POLICY AND RELY ON ITS OWN RESOURCES. THE
LETTER, WHILE NOT SPARING THE CHINESE THE WORST ALBANIAN
EPITHETS, MADE IT CLEAR THAT ALBANIA WOULD STRIVE TO
MAINTAIN NORMAL STATE RELATIONS WITH CHINA DESPITE THE
CHINESE LEADERSHIP'S EXTENSION OF IDEOLOGICAL DIFFERENCES
TO THE SPHERE OF STATE TIES. EVIDENTLY THE ALBANIANS
SOUGHT TO PUT THE ONUS FOR ANY POSSIBLE BREAK IN DIPLOMATIC
TIES ON THE CHINESE.
20. PROSPECTS OF MUDDLING THROUGH
21. THE SINO-ALBANIAN RIFT HAS AGAIN BROUGHT THE QUESTION
OF ALBANIA--WITH ITS STRATEGIC IONIAN AND ADRIATIC BASES
INSIDE THE NATO DEFENSE PERIMETER--BACK ONTO THE CENTER OF
THE INTERNATIONAL STAGE. IT HAS RAISED QUESTIONS OF THE
COUNTRY'S SURVIVAL, POLICIES, AND ORIENTATION.
22. THE ALBANIAN DUUMVIRATE OF HOXHA AND PREMIER SHEHU IS
WELL EXPERIENCED IN SURVIVING DIFFICULTIES. THEY APPEAR TO
THRIVE ON CRISIS. IN FACT, THEIR CONSTANT WARNINGS ABOUT
THE &quot;IMPERIALIST AND SOCIAL IMPERIALIST SAVAGE BLOCKADE
AND ENCIRCLEMENT&quot; ARE MEANT TO PERPETUATE A CRISIS-ANDSIEGE MENTALITY IN THE COUNTRY, TO ELICIT UNITY AND
SUPPORT.
23. THE TWO LEADERS SURVIVED THE ITALIAN AND GERMAN OCCUPATION DURING THE WAR (THE ONLY ONES WHO RECEIVED NO HELP
FROM SOVIET FORCES) AND SUBSEQUENTLY BROKE WIT;

THEIR YUGOSLAV MENTORS (IN 1948) AND SOVIET PATRONS (IN
1961). MOREOVER, THEY APPARENTLY HAVE BEEN ABLE TO
SURMOUNT SOME OF THE TROUBLES CAUSED SINCE 1974 BY
PEKING'S REDUCTION OF AND DELAYS IN DELIVERIES. THEY HAVE
BEEN ASSISTED BY THE FACT THAT THE PEOPLE OF ALBANIA HAVE
LONG BEEN CONDITIONED TO A LOW STANDARD OF LIVING AND DO
NOT YET SHARE THE RISING EXPECTATIONS PRESENT IN MORE
DEVELOPED LANDS.
24. A RUDIMENTARY ECONOMY
25. BECAUSE OF ALBANIA'S RAPID ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT SINCE
THE BREAK WITH THE SOVIETS IN 1961, IT IS TODAY IN A
STRONGER POSITION TO GO IT ALONE THAN AT ANY OTHER TIME
IN ITS HISTORY. AN ECONOMIC INFRASTRUCTURE HAS BEEN
ESTABLISHED AND, ALTHOUGH RUDIMENTARY, IT HAS BEEN ABLE
INCREASINGLY TO SATISFY THE NEEDS OF THE ECONOMY AND THE
PEOPLE. FOR INSTANCE, IT IS CLAIMED THAT:
(A)--THE MACHINE INDUSTRY PRODUCES 85 PERCENT OF ALBANIA'S
SPARE PARTS, WHILE THE LIGHT AND FOOD INDUSTRIES SUPPLY
90 PERCENT OF THE ECONOMY'S NEEDS;
(B)--ALBANIA HAS BEEN SELF-SUFFICIENT IN ELECTRICAL ENERGY,
WITH A SURPLUS FOR EXPORT; AND
(C)--AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION ACHIEVED SELF-SUFFICIENCY IN
BREADGRAINS IN 1976; IN 1977 NEEDS WERE FULLY COVERED
DESPITE A DAMAGING DROUGHT.
26. MOREOVER, THE ALBANIAN LEADERSHIP HAS NOT BEEN CAUGHT
NAPPING. IT HAS LONG ANTICIPATED THE CHINESE EMBARGO, AS
CONFIDENTIAL
PAGE 09

STATE 047489

INDICATED BY ALBANIA'S SIEGE ECONOMY AND THE INTENSIFICATION SEVERAL YEARS AGO OF THE &quot;SELF-RELIANCE&quot; CAMPAIGN.
THE REGIME HAS FOR SOME TIME BEEN ACCUMULATING RESERVES
OF GRAIN, ESSENTIAL RAW MATERIALS, AND MILITARY EQUIPMENT
AND SPARE PARTS.
27. THE CURRENT ECONOMIC POSITION MAY NOT BE ANY MORE
DIFFICULT THAN IN THE MID-1970'S. THE ALBANIAN PLANNERS
HAVE HAD SEVERAL YEARS TO ADJUST TO PROBLEMS CONNECTED
WITH CHINESE AID. BY 1977 THE ECONOMY APPEARED TO BE
BOUNCING BACK FROM THE NEGATIVE IMPACT OF REDUCED CHINESE
AID. THE INDUSTRIAL GROWTH RATE INCREASED TO 6.6 PERCENT,
SEVERAL POINTS OVER THE TWO PREVIOUS YEARS, A POSITIVE

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
DEVELOPMENT EVEN THOUGH THE TARGET OF 9.3 PERCENT WAS NOT
ACHIEVED. RELATIVELY HIGH GROWTH TARGETS WERE ALSO SET
FOR 1978, 8.5 PERCENT IN INDUSTRY AND 28 PERCENT IN
AGRICULTURE. ACCORDING TO THE LATEST INFORMATION,
INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION DURING THE JANUARY-AUGUST PERIOD
EXCEEDED PLANNED GROWTH BY 1.6 PERCENT AND CONSUMER GOODS
OVERFULFILLED THE PLAN BY 3.6 PERCENT. ALL THIS TENDS TO
SUGGEST THAT THE MAIN CONTRIBUTOR TO ALBANIAN ECONOMIC
GROWTH HAS BEEN A DETERMINED MOBILIZATION OF DOMESTIC
RESOURCES.
28. THE FOREIGN TRADE PROBLEM
29. ALBANIA DURING THE 1970'S HAS BEEN ABLE TO REGISTER
SOME PROGRESS IN EXPANDING ITS FOREIGN TRADE NETWORK. IT
NOW HAS MORE TRADE PARTNERS THAN EVER BEFORE. (NOTE: IN
1974, A LEADING FOREIGN TRADE OFFICIAL CLAIMED THAT
ALBANIA TRADED WITH 50 COUNTRIES.) UNDER THE FIFTH FIVEYEAR PLAN (1971-75), EXPORTS INCREASED BY 75 PERCENT OVER
THE PREVIOUS FIVE-YEAR PERIOD. IN 1970, ALBANIA'S TOTAL
FOREIGN TRADE TURNOVER WAS ESTIMATED TO CONSTITUTE ABOUT
37 PERCENT OF ITS GROSS NATIONAL PRODUCT. THIS PERCENTAGE,
CONFIDENTIAL
PAGE 10

STATE 047489

ONE OF THE HIGHEST AMONG BALKAN COUNTRIES, NO DOUBT HAS
INCREASED--TOTAL TRADE TURNOVER REGISTERED SIZABLE ANNUAL
GAINS THROUGH 1974. IN THAT YEAR, A RECORD HIGH OF MORE
THAN DOLS 500 MILLION WAS ACHIEVED. (THE DECLINE IN TOTAL
TRADE IN 1975 AND 1976 APPEARS ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE DROP IN
TRADE WITH CHINA AND A STRICT REGIME OF REDUCING IMPORTS.)
30. DURING THE 1970'S, ALBANIA'S PATTERN OF FOREIGN TRADE
WAS HIGHLIGHTED BY A SIGNIFICANT SHIFT--A STRONGER ORIENTATION TOWARD WEST EUROPEAN AND OTHER FREE WORLD COUNTRIES.
DURING THE 1971-75 PERIOD, MORE THAN THREE QUARTERS OF ALL
TRADE WAS WITH CHINA AND THE CEMA (COUNCIL FOR MUTUAL
ECONOMIC ASSISTANCE) MEMBER-COUNTRIES. NEVERTHELESS,
THERE WAS A NOTABLE ANNUAL INCREASE IN TURNOVER WITH
THE FREE WORLD--ALMOST FIVEFOLD--AS A RESULT OF A CONCERTED
DRIVE IN THIS DIRECTION IN THE EARLY 1970'S. FOR INSTANCE,
IN 1970 CHINA'S AND CEMA'S SHARE OF ALBANIAN TRADE TURNOVER WAS 54 AND 33 PERCENT RESPECTIVELY, WHILE THE FREE
WORLD ACCOUNTED FOR ONLY 13 PERCENT. BY 1975 THE FREE
WORLD'S SHARE HAD INCREASED TO 33.2 PERCENT--EXCEEDING
SLIGHTLY THAT OF CEMA (32.9 PERCENT) AND ALMOST EQUALING
THAT OF CHINA, WHICH DIPPED TO 33.9 PERCENT.
31. THIS DIVERSIFICATION ACHIEVED A VIRTUAL BALANCE
BETWEEN THE THREE TRADING AREAS. ALBANIA'S &quot;OPENING&quot;
TOWARD THE FREE WORLD MEANT NOT ONLY THAT ALBANIA HAD
CONSOLIDATED A FUTURE TRADING BASE THERE BUT ALSO THAT

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
IT HAD ACHIEVED A MARKED REDUCTION IN ITS DEPENDENCE ON
TRADE WITH THE COMMUNIST AREAS.
32. THE ALBANIAN LEADERSHIP IS FACED WITH THE PROBLEM OF
COMPENSATING FOR THE LOSS OF CHINESE AID AND TRADE, FINDING
MARKETS FOR GOODS ONCE DESTINED FOR CHINA, AND FINDING THE
CONFIDENTIAL
PAGE 11

STATE 047489

HARD CURRENCY TO BUY THE EQUIPMENT FOR DEVELOPMENTAL
PROJECTS. A NEW PATRON TO REPLACE CHINA APPEARS TO BE
OUT OF THE QUESTION, AT LEAST IN THE IMMEDIATE FUTURE.
FIRST, HOXHA MIGHT FEEL HE HAS HAD A SURFEIT OF PATRONS;
SECOND, THERE IS NO COUNTRY THAT FITS THE BILL FINANCIALLY
OR IDEOLOGICALLY. CONSTITUTIONAL ARTICLE 28--HOXHA'S
BRAINCHILD--PROHIBITS CREDITS FROM &quot;CAPITALIST, BOURGEOIS
AND REVISIONIST MONOPOLIES AND STATES.&quot; THIS RESTRICTION
APPARENTLY DOES NOT RULE OUT SHORT-TERM PRIVATE COMMERCIAL
CREDITS OR TRADE CREDITS FROM CEMA COUNTRIES. THE
ALBANIANS COULD RELY MORE HEAVILY ON SUCH FINANCING IN
THE FUTURE.
33. THE ALBANIANS ARE MAKING STRONG EFFORTS TO FIND
ALTERNATE MARKETS FOR THEIR FORMER EXPORTS TO CHINA.
(NOTE: AMONG THE PRODUCTS EXPORTED TO CHINA WERE:
CHROMITE, FERRO-NICKEL ORE, BLISTER COPPER AND COPPER
PRODUCTS, CRUDE OIL, BITUMEN, PLYWOOD, COTTON FABRICS,
LEAF TOBACCO, AND CIGARETTES.) THEIR DIFFICULTIES ARE NOT
NEW; THEY HAD TO DO THE SAME THING WHEN ALBANIA BROKE
WITH THE USSR IN 1961. MOREOVER, THE DIFFICULTIES HAVE
BEEN MADE LESS FORMIDABLE BECAUSE NEW MARKETS HAVE
ALREADY BEEN FOUND AS A RESULT OF THE EXPORT DRIVE OVER
THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS. INDEED, THIS EXPORT DRIVE MAY
HAVE BEEN PARTLY PROMPTED BY CHINA'S REDUCTION OF IMPORTS
FROM ALBANIA.
34. THE ALBANIANS' ATTEMPTS TO SOLVE THEIR FOREIGN TRADE
PROBLEMS HAVE LED TO THE FOLLOWING DEVELOPMENTS:
(A)--A TRADE DELEGATION TO DENMARK IN MARCH 1978 (RECIPROCATING A DANISH DELEGATION TO ALBANIA IN SEPTEMBER 1977);
(B)--AN ITALIAN INDUSTRIAL MISSION TO ALBANIA LAST MARCH;
CONFIDENTIAL
PAGE 12

STATE 047489

(C)--A TURKISH TRADE DELEGATION TO ALBANIA LAST MAY AIMED
AT INCREASING THE VOLUME OF TRADE;
(D)--THE FIRST TRADE AGREEMENT WITH MEXICO, IN AUGUST;

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
(E)--THE FIRST TRADE EXHIBIT AT THE MALMO INTERNATIONAL
FAIR (SWEDEN), ALSO IN AUGUST;
(F)--AN ECONOMIC DELEGATION TO INDIA, JULY 29-AUGUST 6,
WHICH VISITED SEVERAL INDUSTRIAL CENTERS;
(G)--AN 18-MEMBER SWISS BUSINESS DELEGATION WHICH VISITED
TIRANA IN SEPTEMBER;
(H)--A VISIT BY FOREIGN TRADE MINISTER NEDIN HOXHA TO THE
ALGIERS INTERNATIONAL FAIR IN SEPTEMBER;
(I)--A DELEGATION OF THE AUSTRIAN CHAMBER OF COMMERCE WHICH
VISITED TIRANA IN NOVEMBER; AND
(J)--A TRADE DELEGATION UNDER FOREIGN TRADE MINISTER HOXHA
WHICH VISITED SWEDEN AND FINLAND IN NOVEMBER.
35. THE ALBANIANS HAVE ALSO APPROACHED AUSTRIA AND OTHER
&quot;NON-SUPERPOWER&quot; COUNTRIES FOR INDUSTRIAL MATERIALS AND
PLANTS, WHICH THEY HAVE OFFERED TO PAY FOR IN CASH OR
SUCH INDUSTRIAL RAW MATERIALS AS CHROME AND FERRO-NICKEL
ORES. THERE HAVE BEEN EFFORTS IN RECENT MONTHS TO INCREASE
TRADE WITH FRANCE, ITALY, GREECE, THE SCANDINAVIAN COUNTRIES, AND SWITZERLAND. BUT THERE HAVE BEEN NO RESPONSES
TO MOSCOW'S OVERTURES FOR TIES. THE PROBLEM OF ALTERNATE
MARKETS APPEARS YET TO BE RESOLVED--PERHAPS PARTLY BECAUSE
WESTERN COUNTRIES STILL DO NOT EXHIBIT MUCH INTEREST IN
CONFIDENTIAL
PAGE 13

STATE 047489

ALBANIA. ON THE POSITIVE SIDE, HOWEVER, THE ALBANIANS
CLAIMED IN 1977 THAT THEIR EXPORT PLAN WAS BEING FULFILLED
AND ALSO ANNOUNCED THAT THE EXPORT TARGET SET FOR 1978 WAS
HIGHER THAN THAT OF THE PREVIOUS YEAR.
36. NEW BID TOWARD &quot;GOOD&quot; WESTERN COUNTRIES
37. THERE APPEARS TO BE NO PROSPECT OF A BASIC CHANGE IN
ALBANIA'S FOREIGN POLICY POSTURE OR ORIENTATION. HOXHA
HAS NOT MADE ANY PRECIPITOUS MOVES, DESPITE THE HARD
REALITY OF ALBANIA NOW FINDING ITSELF AT ODDS WITH ALL
MAJOR POWERS. THE RIFT WITH THE &quot;NEW CHINESE REVISIONISTS&quot;
HAS HAD BUT MINIMAL EFFECT ON THE REGIME'S FOREIGN POLICY
LINE AND INITIATIVES. THE ALBANIAN PARTY HAS APPARENTLY
STEPPED UP CONTACTS WITH THE MARXIST-LENINIST SPLINTER
GROUPS, OVER A DOZEN OF WHICH IT MANAGED (AFTER 1976) TO
ORGANIZE INTO AN INFORMAL &quot;INTERNATIONAL&quot; ATTACKING
PEKING'S &quot;THREE WORLDS THEORY&quot; AND ECHOING ALBANIA'S
ANTI-CHINA POLEMICS. THEN LAST JUNE, AFTER STRADDLING
THE FENCE, THE ALBANIANS CAME OUT IN FULL SUPPORT OF
VIETNAM AGAINST CHINA, DESPITE HANOI'S PRO-SOVIET
ORIENTATION.

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014

38. THE MOST SIGNIFICANT REACTION TO THE RIFT PERHAPS HAS
BEEN THE STRONGEST ALBANIAN PITCH TOWARD THE &quot;BOURGEOIS&quot;
WORLD SINCE THE END OF 1976, WHEN HOXHA OFFERED HIS HAND
TO A SELECT NUMBER OF SMALL- AND MEDIUM-SIZED STATES OF
THE WEST. ON SEPTEMBER 20, 1978, THE ALBANIAN LEADER
POINTED OUT THAT ALBANIA:
(A)--&quot;DULY DISTINGUISHES BETWEEN THOSE VARIOUS BOURGEOIS
STATES WHICH ARE PROGRESSIVE AND WELL-DISPOSED TO IT,&quot; AND
(B)--WANTED TO MAINTAIN FRIENDLY ECONOMIC AND CULTURAL
RELATIONS WITH &quot;ALL THOSE STATES, LARGE OR SMALL, WHICH
RESPECT THE PEOPLE'S SOCIALIST REPUBLIC OF ALBANIA.&quot;
CONFIDENTIAL
PAGE 14

STATE 047489

39. AT THE TOP OF THE LATTER LIST APPEAR TO BE FRANCE,
WHICH HOXHA, A PRODUCT OF FRENCH SCHOOLS, FAVORS, AND
GREECE, WHICH IN HIS EYES HAS ALREADY TRAVERSED THE PATH
FROM ENEMY TO CLOSE (POSSIBLY CLOSEST) FRIEND. THE
ALBANIANS HAVE ALSO MADE BIDS TO ITALY, AUSTRIA, TURKEY,
THE LOW COUNTRIES, SWITZERLAND, AND SCANDINAVIA. SOME
POSSIBLE CANDIDATES OUTSIDE EUROPE ARE CANADA, INDIA,
JAPAN, AND ALGERIA.
40. THE THRUST TOWARD WESTERN EUROPE HAS POSSIBLY BEEN
MADE BECAUSE THE ALBANIANS FEEL THAT THEY CAN INCREASINGLY
SATISFY A LARGE PART OF THEIR ECONOMIC AND TECHNOLOGICAL
NEEDS THERE WITHOUT THE DANGER OF INTERFERENCE IN THEIR
DOMESTIC AFFAIRS.
41. CONTINUED HOSTILITY TOWARD THE US AND THE USSR
42. HOXHA HAS NOT CHANGED HIS STANCE TOWARD STATES WITH AN
ALLEGED RECORD OF ENMITY TOWARD ALBANIA. THERE HAVE BEEN
NO EVIDENT MOVES TOWARD ESTABLISHMENT OF DIPLOMATIC TIES
WITH THE TWO SUPERPOWERS. BOTH &quot;US IMPERIALISM&quot; AND
&quot;SOVIET SOCIAL IMPERIALISM&quot; REMAIN THE MAIN TARGETS OF
THE ALBANIAN LEADERS' ATTACKS AND CONTINUE TO BE REGARDED
AS &quot;EQUALLY DANGEROUS AND AGGRESSIVE.&quot; HOXHA EMPHASIZED
IN HIS SEPTEMBER 20 SPEECH THAT &quot;NOBODY SHOULD CHERISH
THE SLIGHTEST ILLUSION&quot; THAT ALBANIA WOULD CHANGE ITS
STAND TOWARD SOVIET &quot;SOCIAL IMPERIALISM.&quot; TIRANA HAS
IGNORED THE CALLS FOR &quot;NORMALIZATION&quot; OF TIES FROM THE
USSR, AS WELL AS FROM THE LATTER'S SURROGATE, BULGARIA,
EVEN THOUGH HAPPENSTANCE HAS PLACED ALL THREE COUNTRIES
IN THE SAME BOAT DENOUNCING PEKING'S LINE AND POLICIES.

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
43. DESPITE THE FACT THAT THE EAST EUROPEAN COUNTRIES ARE
ALBANIA'S TRADITIONAL AND MAJOR TRADING PARTNERS, THE
ALBANIAN GOVERNMENT DOES NOT APPEAR INTENT ON RETURNING
ITS AMBASSADORS, AFTER AN ABSENCE OF 17 YEARS, TO SOFIA,
BUDAPEST, PRAGUE, WARSAW, AND EAST BERLIN: THEIR GOVERNMENTS ARE &quot;REVISIONISTS&quot; AND &quot;VASSALS&quot; OF THE KREMLIN.
NEITHER DOES IT APPEAR INCLINED TO ESTABLISH DIPLOMATIC
TIES WITH &quot;IMPERIALIST&quot; BRITAIN AND &quot;REVANCHIST&quot; WEST
GERMANY, AT LEAST NOT UNTIL ALBANIA'S MONETARY CLAIMS
AGAINST THEM ARE SATISFIED. HOSTILITY TOWARD MOST OF
THESE COUNTRIES IS LIKELY TO CONTINUE AS LONG AS HOXHA
AND SHEHU REMAIN IN AUTHORITY.
44. REGIME REMAINS STABLE
45. THE OPEN DISPUTE WITH CHINA HAS PRODUCED NO PRECIPITOUS OR EXTREME MOVES DOMESTICALLY. IN ANTICIPATION OF THE
CHINESE MOVES, THE REGIME EARLY IN THE YEAR INTENSIFIED
AUSTERITY BY FURTHER BELT-TIGHTENING MEASURES, SUCH AS
THE DECREED 10-PERCENT CUT IN CONSUMPTION LEVELS. IT
ALSO INCREASED THE PRESSURE ON WORKERS TO INCREASE PRODUCTIVITY, UTILIZE RESERVES MORE EFFICIENTLY, REDUCE
WASTE IN THE ECONOMY, AND WORK HARDER TOWARD ULTIMATE
COMPLETION OF UNFINISHED PROJECTS.
46. RECENT TRAVELERS TO ALBANIA HAVE INDICATED THAT THE
SUPPLY OF FOOD WAS ADEQUATE, ALTHOUGH SOME PINCH IN AVAILABILITY OF CONSUMER GOODS WAS APPARENT. REPORTS OF NEW
PURGES, PURPORTEDLY OF PRO-CHINESE ELEMENTS, HAVE NOT
BEEN CONFIRMED. THERE IS WIDESPREAD EVIDENCE OF MANNED
PILLBOXES, NO DOUBT A DEVICE TO IMPART THE SENSE OF
CRISIS AND URGENCY TO A POPULACE PROBABLY CONFUSED OVER
THE CHINESE RIFT.
47. THE HOXHA-SHEHU DUUMVIRATE APPEARS AS STRONGLY
CONFIDENTIAL
PAGE 16

STATE 047489

ENTRENCHED AS EVER. THROUGH MASSIVE PURGES DURING
1973-75 IT QUASHED ALL OPPOSITION TO ITS POLICIES. IT
APPEARS TO HAVE FORGED A REJUVENATED, MORE OBEDIENT
HIERARCHY--AND, MOST IMPORTANTLY, TO HAVE BROUGHT THE
FORMERLY ASSERTIVE AND PROBABLY &quot;PRO-CHINESE&quot; DEFENSE
ESTABLISHMENT UNDER ITS DIRECT CONTROL. THE LEADERSHIP,
WHICH IS TRYING TO MAKE CAPITAL OUT OF ITS &quot;HEROIC&quot;
DEFIANCE OF ANOTHER &quot;TREASONOUS&quot; PATRON, MAY HAVE EVEN
REKINDLED THE PATRIOTISM OF A WEARY, DOCILE, AND DISCONTENTED POPULACE TO HELP IT IN ITS LATEST TIME OF
TROUBLES. VANCE
