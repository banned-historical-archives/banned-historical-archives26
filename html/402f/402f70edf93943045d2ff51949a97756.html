		<h3>Tor</h3>
		<p><a href="https://www.torproject.org">Tor</a> is an encrypted anonymising network that makes it harder to intercept internet communications, or see where communications are coming from or going to.</p>
		<p>In order to use the WikiLeaks public submission system as detailed above you can download the Tor Browser Bundle, which is a Firefox-like browser available for Windows, Mac OS X and GNU/Linux and pre-configured to connect using the anonymising system Tor.</p>
		<h4>Tails</h4>
		<p>If you are at high risk and you have the capacity to do so, you can also access the submission system through a secure operating system called <a href="https://tails.boum.org">Tails</a>. Tails is an operating system launched from a USB stick or a DVD that aim to leaves no traces when the computer is shut down after use and automatically routes your internet traffic through Tor. Tails will require you to have either a USB stick or a DVD at least 4GB big and a laptop or desktop computer.</p>

		<h3>Tips</h3>
		<p>Our submission system works hard to preserve your anonymity, but we recommend you also take some of your own precautions. Please review these basic guidelines. </p>
		<div>
			<h4>1. Contact us if you have specific problems</h4>
			<p>If you have a very large submission, or a submission with a complex format, or are a high-risk source, please <a href="#submit_help_contact">contact us</a>. In our experience it is always possible to find a custom solution for even the most seemingly difficult situations.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h4>2. What computer to use</h4>
			<p>If the computer you are uploading from could subsequently be audited in an investigation, consider using a computer that is not easily tied to you. Technical users can also use <a href="https://tails.boum.org">Tails</a> to help ensure you do not leave any records of your submission on the computer.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h4>3. Do not talk about your submission to others</h4>
			<p>If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in source protection – it is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This includes other media organisations.</p>
		</div>

	</div>
</div>

<div id="submit_help_after" class="submit_elem">

			</div>
		</div>

		<h3>After</h3>

		<div>
			<h4>1. Do not talk about your submission to others</h4>
			<p>If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in source protection – it is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This includes other media organisations.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h4>2. Act normal</h4>
			<p>If you are a high-risk source, avoid saying anything or doing anything after submitting which might promote suspicion. In particular, you should try to stick to your normal routine and behaviour.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h4>3. Remove traces of your submission</h4>
			<p>If you are a high-risk source and the computer you prepared your submission on, or uploaded it from, could subsequently be audited in an investigation, we recommend that you format and dispose of the computer hard drive and any other storage media you used.</p>
			<p>In particular, hard drives retain data after formatting which may be visible to a digital forensics team and flash media (USB sticks, memory cards and SSD drives) retain data even after a secure erasure. If you used flash media to store sensitive data, it is important to destroy the media.</p>
			<p>If you do this and are a high-risk source you should make sure there are no traces of the clean-up, since such traces themselves may draw suspicion.</p>
			<div>
				<h4>4. If you face legal action</h4>
				<p>If a legal action is brought against you as a result of your submission, there are organisations that may help you. The Courage Foundation is an international organisation dedicated to the protection of journalistic sources. You can find more details at <a href="https://www.couragefound.org">https://www.couragefound.org</a>.</p>

		<p>WikiLeaks publishes documents of political or historical importance that are censored or otherwise suppressed. We specialise in strategic global publishing and large archives.</p>
		<p>The following is the address of our secure site where you can anonymously upload your documents to WikiLeaks editors. You can only access this submissions system through Tor. (See our <a href="#submit_help_tor">Tor tab</a> for more information.) We also advise you to read our <a href="#submit_help_tips">tips for sources</a> before submitting.</p>

Challenges to Dissent Inside China<br />
Â <br />
Teaser:<br />
People seeking to organize protests inside China face obstacles ranging from a cultural fear of chaos to the largest security service in the world.<br />
<br />
Summary:<br />
Organizers attempting to foment protests across China on Feb. 20 met with some success, in that people gathered in disparate locations at the same time, but turnouts were small. China is a difficult place to start any organized dissent. Attempts to start protests face numerous obstacles, including a cultural fear of chaos, the world's largest security service and Internet police, Beijing's ability to keep most grievances local and difficulties in communication between exiled dissidents and protest leaders inside China. <br />
<br />
Analysis:<br />
Much has been made of a call to protest posted on a U.S.-based Chinese dissident news website Feb. 19 that brought out a few hundred people in various Chinese cities Feb. 20. (There is now a second message calling for protests Feb. 27.) The protests did not amount to much, and all reports from the scenes -- including reports from STRATFOR sources -- indicated that the gatherings were of people waiting for something to happen. Many were there to watch in case something happened (even U.S. Ambassador John Huntsman was an onlooker in Beijing); others were simply in the area and decided to watch for some entertainment; still others were ready to become active. But those people considering activism were looking for a leader -- someone to organize and inspire anti-government demonstrators. No such leader appeared.<br />
<br />
Many questions remain about who wrote the call to protests and why, how the locations were chosen, what kind of organization is occurring and where the message originated. Boxun.com claimed to receive an anonymous submission and published it, sending the message into China. The message could have come from within China, and the writers could have chosen Boxun.com because of its position as a leading foreign-based Chinese-language news service. But usually, such calls show up in China first and then are reported by foreign-based media like Boxun.com. STRATFOR cannot verify whether the message was written outside China, but the suspicion is there -- in fact, it is likely that the message originated outside China, given the difficulty of organizing a broad-based resistance movement within China. Investigating the call to protests has given STRATFOR an opportunity to analyze the challenges to organized political dissent within China.<br />
<br />
China is the most populous country in the world, and has a long history of dynastic and regime change through popular uprisings -- a recurring cycle of &lt;centralization and de-centralization&gt; [LINK http://www.stratfor.com/analysis/20090912_china_ongoing_central_local_struggle]. At some point, the center becomes too rigid and alienates itself. The regions then verge on total rupture and national disintegration, before giving rise to a leader who unites the country.Â Current dissidents fit into this cycle, but they will only succeed when the state becomes too rigid and unresponsive. <br />
Â <br />
However, the current Chinese state is built to withstand the cycle. An expansive Communist Party (CPC) runs China, with tentacles reaching throughout society. The CPC serves as a vehicle to monitor, recruit from, and influence society, while managing leadership transitions and policy reform. Chinese institutions are designed specifically to maintain stability in an inherently unstable geography, with multiple layers of central government institutions replicated at the provincial, city and township levels. China's security services are the largest in the world [LINK: http://www.stratfor.com/analysis/20100314_intelligence_services_part_1_spying_chinese_characteristics] in terms of numbers. Compared to previous Chinese governments -- and with most of the rest of the world, with few exceptions -- China's security services have extremely good technical monitoring capabilities which greatly increase their ability to stifle unrest. Any communications presenting a threat to the CPC can be intercepted and the culprits monitored or arrested. This keeps protests isolated to personal and local issues. All of this is something for foreigners to understand, and for those outside of China trying to inspire unrest it is extremely easy to call for action on their computer rather than stand in front of a tank, literally. (I'm not really sure what we're trying to say here) <br />
Â <br />
This is the paradox for Chinese dissidents: China is inherently unstable as it develops, but it now has the most capable counter-resistance security services in the world. The time will be ripe for another revolution in China someday, but the security services permeate all facets of society, making revolution difficult at best.<br />
Â <br />
&lt;h3&gt; China's Fear of Chaos&lt;/h3&gt;<br />
Â <br />
The largest challenge to protests in contemporary China is the Chinese populace itself. There is a strong cultural fear of &lt;em&gt;luan&lt;/em&gt;, which means chaos combined with instability and then add to that the feelings from centuries of hardships that followed (are we talking about a specific instance here?). (Since &lt;em&gt;luan&lt;/em&gt; translates directly as &quot;chaos,&quot; we will use that throughout this article.) This is geopolitically grounded in China's periodic oscillations between near-disintegration and intense centralization and other cycles of conflict. Since China gained access to foreign markets, that access periodically leads the coastal populations to become wealthy while the interior remains poor, and the conflict between the two leads to major upheaval. Before foreign trade created this rift, the conflicts in China were regional, often between the south and the north. Currently, the Cultural Revolution between 1966 and 1976 is the source of the greatest fear of chaos in China. This period had the greatest effect on the current generation of China's leaders and those in the prime of their careers, who are the most powerful people in government, business and society. Many saw their parents denounced or were even harmed themselves during the Cultural Revolution.<br />
<br />
The fear of chaos has a history predating the Cultural Revolution, however. Before that was the Communist Revolution (1927-1949), the Xinhai Revolution in 1911, the Taiping Rebellion (1850-1864) and numerous previous uprisings that often overthrew the established order. Ample experience with chaos has strengthened the fear of chaos among the Chinese. Each revolution devastated the Chinese economy, something the majority of contemporary China wants to avoid. So while the exploits of Mao Zedong, Zhou Enlai and others are commended in Chinese history, much more is taught about maintaining social order -- what recent Chinese government campaigns praise as &quot;social harmony.&quot; The Chinese state is built around these principles but historically has always fallen to internal unrest. The problem for the state is that the fear of chaos is only held by those who also have sufficient living standards (however those may be defined). This follows an old Chinese saying: People who have no shoes do not fear what those who have shoes fear. In other words, people who have nothing will also have no fear of chaos. <br />
Â <br />
To deal with that, state security creates a &quot;Great Wall&quot; to guard against upheaval. But just as the Great Wall was breached, major upheavals have occurred, overturning China's leadership every 30-50 years since 1850.  <br />
Â <br />
&lt;h3&gt;State Security&lt;/h3&gt;<br />
Â <br />
Charged with dispelling the fear of chaos and maintaining social harmony, China's state security apparatus is the world's largest, even surpassing the former Soviet KGB in size. The enormity of the state security apparatus is a reflection of the fear of and potential for chaos within China. While the Chinese carry out much espionage abroad, especially &lt;stealing trade secrets&gt; [LINK: http://www.stratfor.com/weekly/20110119-chinese-espionage-and-french-trade-secrets], the vast focus is on internal security. The more foreign-focused Ministry of State Security (MSS), the Ministry of Public Security (MPS) and various other departments all have expansive informant networks focused on maintaining stability. The prerogative for the MSS lies outside China; the agency does most of its stability-related spying on dissidents and Chinese nationals abroad. However, it also has domestic informants.<br />
Â <br />
The MPS is primarily responsible for domestic unrest and has both the budget and the manpower to smother any potential dissident movements. Specifically, the &lt;Domestic Security Department&gt; [LINK: http://www.stratfor.com/analysis/20100218_china_security_memo_feb_18_2010] is responsible for maintaining informants to watch anyone from foreigners to dissidents to professors. Service employees, such as cleaning ladies or security guards, are often in the employ of Chinese security bodies. While developing &lt;informants to report on corruption at higher levels of government&gt; [LINK: http://www.stratfor.com/analysis/20100902_china_security_memo_sept_2_2010] may be difficult, dissidents have little power and are currently (and have been historically, in the case of anti-revolutionaries) the key targets of public informants. More sophisticated informants are planted within minority and dissident groups, keeping them especially well-monitored. Effectively any groups that begin to organize in China -- from Christian churches to Falun Gong to democracy activists -- are quickly infiltrated by state security. <br />
<br />
The MPS has major powers of arrest and, due to the flexibility of defining what's illegal in China, dissidents are easily arrested and jailed for years; the rest are exiled. Many examples of this have occurred in recent months. Democracy activist Qin Yongmin was arrested again Feb. 1 in Wuhan, Hubei province, according to the Hong Kong Information Centre for Human Rights and Democracy (ICHRD). Qin is known for the Wuhan &quot;Democracy Wall&quot; journal and has already served a total of 23 years in prison. On Dec. 27, 2010, guards surrounded the residential complex of Zhao Lianhai, the activist who exposed &lt;melamine-contaminated milk products&gt; [ LINK: http://www.stratfor.com/analysis/20081010_china_milk_scandal_context] in 2008. At the time, Hong Kong Deputies to the National People's Congress and others thought he would be released soon, but that has not happened yet. When he is released, it is clear that he will be monitored carefully. Information in these cases is hard to come by, simply because of the strength of China's security apparatus and its ability to keep these instances (and dissidents) quiet. <br />
Â <br />
The MPS has one weakness, however: communication across provinces among MPS branches. There are many disconnects between the provincial departments, so for example, when groups of North Korean Christians are smuggled through the country, they are rarely caught. This weakness has yet to be exposed by an outbreak of national unrest. This could be because dissidents face the same communication problem. <br />
Â <br />
Also -- and most importantly following the unrest in the Middle East -- the Chinese state has the largest Internet police in the world [LINK: http://www.stratfor.com/weekly/20101208-china-and-its-double-edged-cyber-sword]. Policing the Internet begins with censoring electronic communications. Various Chinese government agencies employ censors, and also enforce censorship through Internet companies themselves by providing disincentives for allowing inflammatory posts. Such capabilities keep discussion to a minimum and even result in disallowing searches; for example, searches for &quot;Egypt&quot; were not allowed during the unrest in that country. [LINK- http://www.stratfor.com/analysis/20110201-chinas-view-unrest-egypt-and-middle-east]. The Military Intelligence Department has large numbers of analysts monitoring Internet traffic, and this capability could easily be used against dissidents organizing protests.  The MPS likely has this capability as well and can track down and arrest activists like the 100 the ICHRD said Feb. 21 had been taken into custody. In short, if someone announces a protest in Chinese (did we mean &quot;in Chinese&quot; or &quot;in China&quot;?) on the Internet, the security services will know about it. They were undoubtedly &lt;monitoring communications after watching the Middle East&gt; [LINK: http://www.stratfor.com/analysis/20110216-china-security-memo-feb-16-2011]. This especially showed Feb. 20 when there was a major security presence at all the sites named as locations for protests, and even many unannounced locations assessed to be at risk, before 2 p.m.<br />
<br />
These capabilities are what make the People's Republic of China somewhat different from other incarnations of China that have faced unrest. China's monitoring capability is much stronger, but at the same time, the Internet is a tool in dissidents' hands. These tools (which tools?) will allow the CPC to hold power longer, but they also &lt;present unique challenges&gt;. These, (which?) however, are not a panacea for either side, and cannot change fundamental economic conditions. At best, they can only (???) <br />
Â <br />
&lt;h3&gt;Keeping Grievances Local&lt;/h3&gt;<br />
Â <br />
Beijing has been very effective at getting citizens to blame local governments, rather than the national government, for their problems. And this is not wrong, as local governments are often full of corruption, bureaucracy and lackluster governance. Protests are extremely common throughout China, but they are usually focused on a local incident. Recent examples include &lt;family members attacking a hospital over the death of a patient&gt; [LINK: http://www.stratfor.com/analysis/20110209-china-security-memo-feb-9-2011], &lt;migrant workers protesting unpaid wages&gt; [LINK: http://www.stratfor.com/analysis/20101222-china-security-memo-dec-22-2010], &lt;citizens angry at local companies gambling away funds&gt; [LINK: http://www.stratfor.com/analysis/20101007_china_security_memo_oct_7_2010], and most commonly &lt;citizens angry over land acquisition by the local government&gt; [LINK: http://www.stratfor.com/analysis/20100121_china_security_memo_jan_21_2010]. <br />
Â <br />
At any given time at least one of these types of protests is occurring in China, but it never coalesces into something that threatens the local government. Chinese police have gained a wealth of experience in policing these incidents, and often there are more riot police at the scene then protesters. When the problems are not solved locally, many petitioners head to Beijing to ask for intervention. There is a long history of this in China, and &lt;petitioning&gt; [LINK: http://www.stratfor.com/analysis/20100729_china_security_memo_july_29_2010] is not so much threatening the national government as groveling to it. In fact, if anything it is a threat to the records of local officials trying to move up, and for that reason those officials sometimes employ &lt;private security companies&gt; to stop the petitioners before they reach their destination [LINK: http://www.stratfor.com/analysis/20100916_china_security_memo_sept_16_2010]. <br />
Â <br />
Occasionally protests do touch on national issues, but even these are often encouraged by Beijing, such as &lt;nationalists protesting Japan&gt; [LINK: http://www.stratfor.com/analysis/20101021_china_security_memo_oct_21_2010], which is seen as a less threatening way for Chinese citizens to vent discontent. Still, they are monitored very closely and broken up when they approach any semblance of instability. Such protests could spin out of control, but so far Beijing sees them as both controllable and opportune for directing anger elsewhere. <br />
Â <br />
Most importantly for those trying to organize on Feb. 20, none of the aforementioned types of protests are calls for democracy or for any sort of new government; they are simply asking for good governance on the part of the CPC. This becomes a major issue for those trying to organize against the CPC -- particularly those who want democracy, be it the West or expatriate dissidents -- because this is not a major concern or desire among Chinese citizens. However, if conditions are bad enough to demonstrate a failure to govern on the CPC's part, calls for political change could lead to calls for democracy. <br />
<br />
There are many national issues -- and a convergence of local issues -- that are becoming more important. The challenge for a protest organizer is to unite protesters over these various issues and bring them all out at once. The Feb. 20 Chinese &quot;Jasmine&quot; gatherings were likely a test case to see if this could happen. But this will become a greater issue as rising inflation combines with other socio-economic problems, as STRATFOR has &lt;forecast&gt; [LINK: http://www.stratfor.com/forecast/20110107-annual-forecast-2011]. When these issues come to a breaking point, protest organizers likely will be able to achieve mass organization in the streets. Feb. 20 showed that China is not at that point yet -- but it might have planted thoughts to speed up the process. <br />
Â <br />
&lt;h3&gt;Communication Breakdowns&lt;/h3&gt;<br />
Â <br />
Those leading Chinese dissidents who have not been locked up have been exiled and are not allowed to travel back into China (with a few exceptions like &lt;Ai WeiWei&gt; [LINK: http://www.stratfor.com/analysis/20101111_china_security_memo_nov_11_2010]. Like Wang Dan, who is most famous for asking Chinese youth to revolt like those in the Middle East, these exiled dissidents have often called for change within China to little effect. Most of these dissidents have become out of touch with the issues on the ground (or were already out of touch, having been upper class democracy activists). They have trouble appealing to a large enough group of people to effectively take to the streets. Worse, they have little contact with organizers on the ground in China, as any communications they attempt are intercepted.  Their capabilities to lead something from abroad are limited at best. The &lt;social media revolution&gt; [LINK: http://www.stratfor.com/weekly/20110202-social-media-tool-protest], particularly orchestrated from outside China, can hardly connect within. Thus, these leaders provide little in the form of a genuine opposition movement with a coherent core.<br />
Â <br />
STRATFOR suspects that the recent Feb. 20 gatherings could be an attempt at organization from outside China. They notably went through an external news service, rather than first spreading the word internally. According to Boxun News founder Watson Meng, Boxun first received word that something was afoot in a Twitter message posted by Mimitree1 on Feb. 17 or 18. The message (now erased) said that a Chinese &quot;Jasmine Revolution&quot; would occur Feb. 20 and that details would be released through Boxun.com. Given that Boxun.com is the most-read foreign-based Chinese news source in China, it is a good medium, particularly for someone outside China to spread word of a protest. Savvy Internet users inside China access the site through proxy servers, which allow them to reach banned IP addresses like Boxun. The communications are then spread within China across microblog services like Sina Weibo (the most popular Chinese version of Twitter), instant messaging service QQ and sometimes via text messages.<br />
<br />
Although the Feb. 20 effort was a success in getting many gatherings to occur across the country at once, the numbers indicated that organizers need to focus on appealing to the masses. The small turnout could be a result of the organizers being outside of the country and out of touch. However, the most notable characteristic of the Feb. 20 gatherings was the organizers' ability to prompt events in multiple locations all at once; testing that ability might have been all the organizers had in mind. <br />
<br />
&lt;h3&gt;Looking Forward&lt;/h3&gt;<br />
Â <br />
The CPC has a strong authority that will be extremely difficult to challenge. However, the CPC is dealing with challenges other than potential dissidents; it also faces major socioeconomic issues. These problems could spiral out of control and tap into a deep wellspring of popular discontent, as has happened consistently throughout China's history.Â Given the &lt;2012 leadership transition&gt; [LINK: http://www.stratfor.com/analysis/20100910_looking_2012_china_next_generation_leaders] and vague calls for &lt;political reform&gt; from Prime Minister Wen Jiabao [LINK: http://www.stratfor.com/analysis/20101013_oct_11_petition_and_political_reform_china], protest organizers -- dissidents who want to overthrow the CPC -- will be watching for the right chain of events, the right underlying causes, to get people out in the streets. With the Feb. 20 gatherings, they planted the idea that cross-provincial organization can occur. Now they will have to figure out how to unite people with various grievances and bring many more people together to demonstrate. Then they will need to organize a clear and coherent opposition group that offers an alternative to the CPC, or at the very least the threat of an alternative that would make the CPC willing to enact political reforms.<br />
Â <br />
It is hard to say when such developments might occur. STRATFOR continues to forecast a destabilizing slowdown as China's economic model &lt;burns out in the coming few years&gt; [LINK-http://www.stratfor.com/forecast/20100120_decade_forecast_20102020 ]. While the Chinese state has vastly expanded its capability to quell unrest, it is by no means invincible. <br />
