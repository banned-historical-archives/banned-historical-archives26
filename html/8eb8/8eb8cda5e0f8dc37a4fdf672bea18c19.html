		<h3>Tor</h3>
		<p><a href="https://www.torproject.org">Tor</a> is an encrypted anonymising network that makes it harder to intercept internet communications, or see where communications are coming from or going to.</p>
		<p>In order to use the WikiLeaks public submission system as detailed above you can download the Tor Browser Bundle, which is a Firefox-like browser available for Windows, Mac OS X and GNU/Linux and pre-configured to connect using the anonymising system Tor.</p>
		<h4>Tails</h4>
		<p>If you are at high risk and you have the capacity to do so, you can also access the submission system through a secure operating system called <a href="https://tails.boum.org">Tails</a>. Tails is an operating system launched from a USB stick or a DVD that aim to leaves no traces when the computer is shut down after use and automatically routes your internet traffic through Tor. Tails will require you to have either a USB stick or a DVD at least 4GB big and a laptop or desktop computer.</p>

		<h3>Tips</h3>
		<p>Our submission system works hard to preserve your anonymity, but we recommend you also take some of your own precautions. Please review these basic guidelines. </p>
		<div>
			<h4>1. Contact us if you have specific problems</h4>
			<p>If you have a very large submission, or a submission with a complex format, or are a high-risk source, please <a href="#submit_help_contact">contact us</a>. In our experience it is always possible to find a custom solution for even the most seemingly difficult situations.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h4>2. What computer to use</h4>
			<p>If the computer you are uploading from could subsequently be audited in an investigation, consider using a computer that is not easily tied to you. Technical users can also use <a href="https://tails.boum.org">Tails</a> to help ensure you do not leave any records of your submission on the computer.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h4>3. Do not talk about your submission to others</h4>
			<p>If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in source protection – it is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This includes other media organisations.</p>
		</div>

	</div>
</div>

<div id="submit_help_after" class="submit_elem">

			</div>
		</div>

		<h3>After</h3>

		<div>
			<h4>1. Do not talk about your submission to others</h4>
			<p>If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in source protection – it is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This includes other media organisations.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h4>2. Act normal</h4>
			<p>If you are a high-risk source, avoid saying anything or doing anything after submitting which might promote suspicion. In particular, you should try to stick to your normal routine and behaviour.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h4>3. Remove traces of your submission</h4>
			<p>If you are a high-risk source and the computer you prepared your submission on, or uploaded it from, could subsequently be audited in an investigation, we recommend that you format and dispose of the computer hard drive and any other storage media you used.</p>
			<p>In particular, hard drives retain data after formatting which may be visible to a digital forensics team and flash media (USB sticks, memory cards and SSD drives) retain data even after a secure erasure. If you used flash media to store sensitive data, it is important to destroy the media.</p>
			<p>If you do this and are a high-risk source you should make sure there are no traces of the clean-up, since such traces themselves may draw suspicion.</p>
			<div>
				<h4>4. If you face legal action</h4>
				<p>If a legal action is brought against you as a result of your submission, there are organisations that may help you. The Courage Foundation is an international organisation dedicated to the protection of journalistic sources. You can find more details at <a href="https://www.couragefound.org">https://www.couragefound.org</a>.</p>

		<p>WikiLeaks publishes documents of political or historical importance that are censored or otherwise suppressed. We specialise in strategic global publishing and large archives.</p>
		<p>The following is the address of our secure site where you can anonymously upload your documents to WikiLeaks editors. You can only access this submissions system through Tor. (See our <a href="#submit_help_tor">Tor tab</a> for more information.) We also advise you to read our <a href="#submit_help_tips">tips for sources</a> before submitting.</p>

<br />
   In 2012, the Communist Party of China's (CPC) leaders will retire and a<br />
   new generation -- the so-called Fifth Generation -- will take the helm.<br />
   The transition will affect the CPC's most powerful decision-making organs,<br />
   determining the make up of the 18th CCP Central Committee, the Political<br />
   Bureau (Politburo) of the Central Committee, and, most importantly, the<br />
   nine-member Standing Committee of the Politburo (SCP) that is the core of<br />
   political power in China**.<br />
<br />
   While there is considerable uncertainty over the hand off, given China's<br />
   lack of clear, institutionalized procedures for the succession and the<br />
   immense challenges facing the regime, nevertheless there is little reason<br />
   to anticipate a full-blown succession crisis. However, the sweeping<br />
   personnel change comes at a critical juncture in China's modern history,<br />
   in which the economic model that has enabled decades of rapid growth has<br />
   become unsustainable, social unrest is rising, and international<br />
   resistance to China's policies is increasing. At the same time, the<br />
   characteristics of the fifth generation leaders suggest a cautious and<br />
   balanced civilian leadership paired with an increasingly influential and<br />
   nationalist military, leading to frictions over policy even as both groups<br />
   remain firmly committed to perpetuating the regime.<br />
<br />
   Therefore the Chinese leadership that emerges from 2012 will likely be<br />
   incapable of decisively pursuing deep structural reforms, obsessively<br />
   focused on maintaining internal stability, and more aggressive in pursuing<br />
   the core strategic interests it sees as essential to this stability.<br />
<br />
   PART ONE -- CIVILIAN LEADERSHIP<br />
   Power transitions in the People's Republic of China have always been<br />
   fraught with uncertainties, which arise because China does not have clear<br />
   and fixed institutional procedures for the transfer of power from outgoing<br />
   to incoming leaders or from one generation to another. The state's<br />
   founding leader, Mao Zedong, did not establish a formal process before he<br />
   died, giving rise to a power struggle in his wake. Deng Xiaoping, like<br />
   Mao, was a strong leader whose personal power could override rules and<br />
   institutions. Deng's retirement also failed to set a firm precedent -- he<br />
   saw two of his chosen successors fall from grace after they lost out amid<br />
   factional struggle, and then maintained extensive influence well after<br />
   formally retiring and passing the baton to Jiang Zemin and his successor,<br />
   Hu Jintao.<br />
<br />
   Nevertheless, China has a series of precedents and informal rules that<br />
   enable power to transfer from administration to administration, generation<br />
   to generation, and in recent years these implicit rules moved towards<br />
   formalization. Deng set in motion a pattern that enabled the 2002<br />
   transition from President Jiang Zemin to Hu Jintao to go smoothly, even<br />
   with factional tensions behind the scenes. Deng had appointed Hu to be<br />
   Jiang's successor, lending some of his great authority to Hu and thus<br />
   conferring a degree of inevitability to the transition, deterring<br />
   potential power grabs. This pattern was reinforced when Jiang put<br />
   Vice-President Xi Jinping in place to succeed Hu in 2012. Thus the coming<br />
   transition will be a test to see whether the pattern can hold, and the<br />
   transition proceed in an orderly fashion.<br />
<br />
   THE FIFTH GENERATION'S CHARACTERISTICS<br />
<br />
   Every country experiences leadership changes that can be described as<br />
   generational in one sense or another, but modern Chinese history has been<br />
   so eventful as to create generations whose elites share distinct<br />
   characteristics and are markedly different from their forbears in their<br />
   historical, educational and career experiences.  The &quot;generational&quot;<br />
   framework was created retrospectively by Deng, who dubbed himself the core<br />
   second generation leader after Mao, and was reinforced by events and<br />
   patterns in leadership promotion and retirement. The most defining factor<br />
   of a Chinese leadership generation is its historical background. The first<br />
   generation defined itself by the formation of the Communist Party and the<br />
   Long March of exile in the 1930s, the second generation in the war against<br />
   the Japanese (WWII), and the third during civil war and the Communist<br />
   Revolution of 1949. The fourth generation came of age during the Great<br />
   Leap Forward in the late 1950s, Mao's first attempt to transform the<br />
   entire Chinese economy.<br />
<br />
   The fifth generation is the first group of leaders who cannot -- or can<br />
   hardly -- remember a time before the founding of the People's Republic.<br />
   These leaders' formative experiences were shaped during the Cultural<br />
   Revolution (1967-77), a period of deep social and political upheaval in<br />
   which the Mao regime empowered party loyalists nationwide to purge<br />
   political opponents in the bureaucracy and Communist Party. Schools and<br />
   universities were closed in 1966 and youths were &quot;sent down&quot; to rural<br />
   areas to do manual labor, including many fifth generation leaders such as<br />
   likely future president Xi Jinping. Some young people were able to return<br />
   to college after 1970, where they could only study Marxism-Leninism and<br />
   CPC ideology, while others sought formal education when schools were<br />
   reopened after the Cultural Revolution ended. Very few trained abroad, so<br />
   they did not become attuned to foreign attitudes and perceptions in their<br />
   formative days. Characteristically, given the fuller educational<br />
   opportunities since the late 1970s, the upcoming leaders come from a wide<br />
   range of studies, and many were trained as lawyers, economists and social<br />
   scientists, as opposed to the engineers and natural scientists who have<br />
   dominated the previous generations of leadership.<br />
<br />
   In 2012, only Vice-President Xi Jinping and Vice-Premier Li Keqiang will<br />
   remain on the Politburo Standing Committee, the core decision-making body<br />
   in China, and seven new members will join (assuming the number of total<br />
   members remains at nine, which has been the case since 2002), all drawn<br />
   from the broader Politburo and born after October 1944 according to a rule<br />
   established under Deng requiring Chinese leaders to retire at the age of<br />
   68. The current leaders who are set to retire will make every attempt to<br />
   strike a deal that prevents the balance of power within the Politburo and<br />
   the SCP from tipping against them and their faction.<br />
<br />
   At present China's leaders divide roughly into two factions, broadly<br />
   defined as the populists and the elitists. First comes the populists, more<br />
   accurately referred to as the &quot;tuanpai,&quot; those leaders associated with<br />
   President Hu Jintao and China's Communist Youth League (CCYL), which Hu<br />
   led in the 1980s and which comprises his political base (&quot;tuanpai&quot; means<br />
   the &quot;league faction,&quot; in reference to the Communist Youth League or CCYL).<br />
   The CCYL is a massive organization that prepares future members of the<br />
   CPC, and is structured with central leadership and provincial and local<br />
   branches based in the country's schools. In keeping with the CCYL's rigid<br />
   hierarchy and doctrinal training, the policies of Hu Jintao's &quot;CCYL<br />
   clique&quot; focus on centralizing and consolidating power, maintaining social<br />
   stability, and seeking to redistribute wealth to alleviate income<br />
   disparities, regional differences, and social ills. The clique has grown<br />
   increasingly powerful under Hu's patronage, since he has promoted people<br />
   from CCYL backgrounds, some of whom he worked with during his term at the<br />
   group's secretariat, and has increased the number of CCYL-affiliated<br />
   leaders in China's provincial governments. Several top candidates for the<br />
   Politburo Standing Committee in 2012 are part of this group, including Li<br />
   Keqiang and Li Yuanchao, followed by Liu Yandong, Zhang Baoshun, Yuan<br />
   Chunqing, and Liu Qibao.<br />
<br />
   Second come the elitists, or more specifically, leaders associated with<br />
   former President Jiang Zemin and his Shanghai clique. Policies tend to aim<br />
   at maintaining China's rapid economic growth, with the coastal provinces<br />
   unabashedly leading the way, and pushing forward economic restructuring to<br />
   improve China's international competitiveness and cut back inefficiencies,<br />
   even at the risk of causing painful changes for some regions or sectors of<br />
   society. Distinct from but often associated with the Shanghai clique are<br />
   the infamous &quot;princelings,&quot; the sons, grandsons and relatives of the CPC's<br />
   founding fathers and previous leaders who have risen up the ranks of<br />
   China's system often with the help of familial connections. Though the<br />
   princelings are criticized for benefiting from undeserved privilege and<br />
   nepotism, and some have suffered from low support in internal party<br />
   elections, they have name recognition from their proud Communist family<br />
   histories and often have the finest educations and career experiences and<br />
   still have access to personal networks set up by their fathers. The<br />
   Shanghai clique and princelings are joined by economic reformists of<br />
   various stripes who come from different backgrounds, mostly in the state<br />
   apparatus such as the central or provincial bureaucracy and ministries,<br />
   often technocrats and specialists. Prominent members of this faction,<br />
   eligible for the 2012 Politburo Standing Committee, include Wang Qishan,<br />
   Zhang Dejiang, Bo Xilai, Yu Zhengsheng and Zhang Gaoli.<br />
<br />
   The struggle between the populist and elitist factions is a subset of the<br />
   deeper struggle in Chinese history between the isolationist (or<br />
   inward-looking) and internationalist (or outward-looking) impulses.<br />
   Because of China's vast and diverse geography, China has historically<br />
   required a strong central government to maintain political unity, usually<br />
   situated in the Northern China Plain. But this unity tends to break down<br />
   over time as different regions pursue their own interests and form<br />
   relationships with the outside world that become more vital to them than<br />
   their unity with the rest of China. The regionalist and internationalist<br />
   tendencies have given rise to the ancient struggle between the north<br />
   (Beijing) and the south (Shanghai), the difficulties that successive<br />
   Chinese regimes have had in subordinating the far south (i.e. Guangdong<br />
   and the Pearl River Delta region), and modern Beijing's anxiety over the<br />
   perceived threat of separatism from Taiwan, Xinjiang and Tibet. In this<br />
   context, the struggle between the two dominant political factions appears<br />
   as the 21st century political manifestation of the irresolvable struggle<br />
   between Beijing, the political center, and the other regions, whose<br />
   economic vibrancy leads them to pursue their own ends. While Hu Jintao and<br />
   his allies emphasize central control and redistributing regional wealth to<br />
   create a more unified China, the followers of Jiang Zemin tend to<br />
   emphasize the need to let China's most competitive regions grow and<br />
   prosper without being weighed down by the less dynamic regions.<br />
<br />
   FACTIONAL BALANCE<br />
<br />
   The handful of politicians who are almost certain to join the Politburo<br />
   Standing Committee in 2012 appear to show a balance between factional<br />
   tendencies. The top two, Xi Jinping and Li Keqiang, are the youngest<br />
   members of the current Standing Committee and all but destined to become<br />
   President Xi and Premier Li. Xi is a princeling -- son of Xi Zhongxun, an<br />
   early Communist revolutionary and deputy prime minister -- and a model of<br />
   the coastal manufacturing power-nexus due to his experiences leading in<br />
   Fujian, Zhejiang and Shanghai. But Xi is also a people's politician, his<br />
   hardships as a rural worker during the Cultural Revolution make him widely<br />
   admired. He is the best example of bridging both major factions, promoting<br />
   economic reforms but being seen as having the people's best interests at<br />
   heart. Meanwhile Li was trained as an economist under a prestigious<br />
   teacher at Beijing University, received a law degree, and is a former top<br />
   secretary of the CCYL and stalwart of Hu's faction -- economics is his<br />
   specialty but with the purposes of social harmony in mind (for instance he<br />
   is famous for promoting further revitalization of the rust-belt Northeast<br />
   industrial plant). Li also has experience in leadership positions in the<br />
   provinces, such as Henan, an agricultural province, and Liaoning, a<br />
   heavy-industrial province, giving him a view of starkly different aspects<br />
   of the national economy.<br />
<br />
   After Xi Jinping and Li Keqiang, the most likely contenders for seats on<br />
   the SCP are Li Yuanchao, director of the CPC's powerful organization<br />
   department (CCYL clique), Wang Yang (CCYL), member of the CPC's Politburo,<br />
   Liu Yunshan (CCYL), director of the CPC's propaganda department, and<br />
   Vice-Premier Wang Qishan (princeling). Ultimately it is impossible to<br />
   predict exactly which leaders will be appointed to the SCP. The line up is<br />
   the result of intense negotiation between the current SCP members, with<br />
   the retiring members (everyone except Xi Jinping and Li Keqiang) wielding<br />
   the most influence. Currently, of nine SCP members, as many as six count<br />
   as proteges of Jiang Zemin, and they will push for their followers rather<br />
   than letting Hu get the upper hand. Moreover, the CCYL clique looks<br />
   extremely well placed for 2017 reshuffle, at which point many of Jiang's<br />
   proteges will be too old to sit on the SCP while a number of rising stars<br />
   in the CCYL currently serving as provincial chiefs will be well set for<br />
   promotion.<br />
<br />
   Therefore it seems possible that the 2012 SCP balance will lean slightly<br />
   in favor of Jiang's Shanghai clique and the princelings, but that their<br />
   advantage will not persist throughout the entire ten years of the Xi and<br />
   Li administration. In turn, Xi, like his predecessors, will have to spend<br />
   his early years as president attempting to consolidate power so that he<br />
   can put his followers in places of power and begin to shape the succeeding<br />
   generation of leaders to the benefit of himself and his circle.<br />
<br />
   There is a remote possibility that the number of members on the SCP could<br />
   be cut from nine down to seven, which was the number of posts before 2002.<br />
   This would likely result in a stricter enforcement of age limits in<br />
   determining which leaders to promote, perhaps setting the cut-off<br />
   birthyear of 1945 or 1946 (instead of 1944). Stricter age criteria could<br />
   eliminate three contenders from Jiang Zemin's Shanghai clique (Politburo<br />
   member Zhang Gaoli, Vice-Premier Zhang Dejiang, and Shanghai Party<br />
   Secretary Yu Zhengsheng) and one from Hu Jintao's clique (Politburo member<br />
   Liu Yandong), leaving Chongqing Party Secretary Bo Xilai (a highly popular<br />
   princeling with unorthodox policies, but like Xi Jinping known to straddle<br />
   the factional divide) and Director of the CPC General Office Ling Jihua<br />
   (secretary to Hu Jintao, CCYL clique) as the most likely final additions<br />
   to the SCP. The overall balance -- in this scenario of slightly younger<br />
   age requirements -- would then lean in favor of Hu Jintao's clique. <br />
<br />
   COLLECTIVE RULE<br />
<br />
   The factions are not so antagonistic as to point towards internecine power<br />
   struggle, but will exercise power by forging compromises and trying to act<br />
   as a collective. Leaders are chosen by their superiors through a process<br />
   of careful negotiation so as to prevent an imbalance of one faction over<br />
   another that could lead to purges or counter-purges. That balance looks to<br />
   be roughly maintained in the configuration of leaders in 2012. In terms of<br />
   policy making, powerful leaders will continue to debate deep policy<br />
   disagreements behind close doors, and through a process of intense<br />
   negotiation arrive at a party line that they will almost always maintain<br />
   uniformly in public. The stark disagreements and fierce debates echo<br />
   through the statements by minor officials or academics, public<br />
   discussions, newspaper editorials, and other venues. In extreme situations<br />
   these policy battles could lead to the ousting of officials who end up on<br />
   the wrong side, but the highest party leaders will not openly contradict<br />
   each other on matters of great moment unless a dire breakdown has occurred<br />
   (such as the case with the fallen Shanghai party secretary Cheng Liangyu).<br />
   Still it is crucial to understand that maintaining the central factional<br />
   balance is a constant struggle.<br />
<br />
   Conducive to maintaining the factional balance is the fact that the fifth<br />
   generation leadership appears to be in broad agreement on the state's<br />
   broadest economic and political goals, even if they differ on the means of<br />
   achieving those goals. First, there is general agreement on the need to<br />
   continue with China's internationally oriented economic and structural<br />
   reforms. These leaders spent the prime of their lives in the midst of<br />
   China's rapid economic transformation from a poor and isolated<br />
   pariah-state into an international industrial and commercial giant, and<br />
   were the first to experience the benefits of this transformation. They<br />
   also know that the CPC's legitimacy has come to rest, in great part, on<br />
   its ability to deliver greater economic opportunity and prosperity to the<br />
   country, and that the greatest risk to the regime would likely come in the<br />
   form of a shrinking or dislocated economy that causes massive<br />
   unemployment. Therefore they remain for the most part dedicated to<br />
   continuing with market-oriented reform, though they will do so gradually<br />
   and carefully and will not seek to intensify reformist efforts to the<br />
   point of dramatically increasing the risk of social disruption. Needless<br />
   to say, while the elitists can be energetic in their pursuit of economic<br />
   liberalization, the populists tend to be more suspicious and more willing<br />
   to re-centralize controls to avoid undesirable political side-effects,<br />
   even at the expense of long-term risks to the economy.<br />
<br />
   Second, and more fundamentally, all fifth generation leaders are committed<br />
   to maintaining the CPC's rule. The chaos of the Cultural Revolution<br />
   impressed upon the fifth generation a sense of the extreme dangers of<br />
   China's having allowed an autocratic ruler to dominate the decision making<br />
   process and intra-party struggle to run rampant. Subsequent events have<br />
   reinforced the fear of internal divisions: the protest and military<br />
   crackdown at Tiananmen Square in 1989, the threat of alternative movements<br />
   exemplified by the Falun Gong protest in 1999, the general rise in social<br />
   unrest throughout the economic boom of the 1990s and 2000s, and more<br />
   recently challenges posed by natural disasters like the Sichuan earthquake<br />
   in 2008, ethnic violence and riots in Tibet in 2008 and Xinjiang in 2009,<br />
   and the pressures of economic volatility since the global economic crisis<br />
   of 2008-9. These events have further emphasized the need to maintain unity<br />
   and stability in the party ranks and in Chinese society, by force when<br />
   necessary. Therefore while the Fifth Generation is likely to agree on the<br />
   need to continue with economic reform and perhaps even limited political<br />
   reform, it will do so only insofar as it can without destabilizing<br />
   socio-political stability, and will delay, soften, undermine, or reverse<br />
   reform in order to ensure stability. Once again, the difference between<br />
   the factions lies in judging how best to preserve and bolster the regime.<br />
<br />
   REGIONALISM -- [NOTE: I've been asked to shorten this section but really<br />
   don't know how, so writer's discretion is requested]<br />
    <br />
   Beyond the apparent balance of forces in the central party and government<br />
   organs, there remains the tug-of-war between the central government in<br />
   Beijing and the 33 provincial governments (not to mention Taiwan) -- a<br />
   reflection of the timeless struggle in China between center and periphery.<br />
   If China is to be struck by deep destabilization under the watch of the<br />
   fifth generation leaders, there is a good chance it will happen along<br />
   regional lines. Stark differences have emerged as China's coastal<br />
   manufacturing provinces have surged ahead, while provinces in the<br />
   interior,  west, and northeast lag behind. The CPC's solution to this<br />
   problem has generally been to redistribute wealth from the booming coasts<br />
   to the interior, effectively subsidizing the much poorer and<br />
   less-developed regions in the hope that they will eventually develop more<br />
   sustainable economies. In some cases, such as Anhui or Sichuan provinces,<br />
   urbanization and development have accelerated in recent years. But in<br />
   general the interior remains weak and dependent on subsidization via<br />
   Beijing.<br />
<br />
   The problem for China's leadership is that the coastal provinces'<br />
   export-led model of growth that has created wonderful returns throughout<br />
   the past three decades has begun to reach a climax, and China's annual<br />
   double-digit growth rates are expected to slow down because of weakening<br />
   external demand, rising domestic costs and other factors. The result will<br />
   be shriller demands from the poor provinces and tighter fists from the<br />
   rich provinces -- in other words, exposing and deepening competition and<br />
   in some cases animosity between the regions.<br />
<br />
   The fifth generation cohort, more so than any generation before it, has<br />
   extensive cross-regional career experience. This is because in order to<br />
   climb to the top ranks of party and government, many of these leaders have<br />
   followed the career path of serving in central organizations in Beijing,<br />
   then rotating to do one stint or more as governor or party secretary of<br />
   one of the provinces (the farther flung, the better), and then returning<br />
   to a higher central party or government position in Beijing. For instance,<br />
   Hu Jintao served as party chief of Tibet before rising the ranks in<br />
   Beijing and  many of the top fifth generation leaders have followed such<br />
   career paths. Furthermore it has become increasingly common to put<br />
   officials in charge of a region different from where they originally<br />
   hailed, so as to reduce regionalism and regional biases (a practice that<br />
   has precedents in China's imperial history to prevent the rise of<br />
   mini-fiefdoms and devolution of power). Of the most likely members of the<br />
   2012 Politburo Standing Committee (the core of the core of Chinese power),<br />
   more of them than ever before has experience serving as a provincial chief<br />
   -- which means that when these leaders take over the top national<br />
   positions they will theoretically have a better grasp of the realities<br />
   facing the provinces they rule, and will be less likely to be beholden to<br />
   a single regional constituency or support base. This could somewhat<br />
   mitigate the central government's difficulty in dealing with profound<br />
   divergences of interest between the central and provincial governments.<br />
<br />
   But regional differences are grounded in fundamental, geographical and<br />
   ethnic realities, and have become increasingly aggravated by the<br />
   disproportionate benefits of China's economic success. Temporary changes<br />
   of position across the country have not prevented China's leaders from<br />
   forming lasting loyalty bonds with certain provincial chiefs to the<br />
   neglect of others; and many politicians still have experience entirely on<br />
   the regional, and not central, level of government. The patron-client<br />
   system, by which Chinese officials give their loyalty to superiors in<br />
   exchange for political perks or monetary rewards, remains ineradicable,<br />
   extending to massive personal networks across party and government<br />
   bureaus, from the center to the regions. Few central leaders remain<br />
   impervious to the pull of these regional networks, and none can remain in<br />
   power long if his regional power base or bases has been cut. The tension<br />
   between the center and provinces will remain one of the greatest sources<br />
   of stress on the central leadership as they negotiate national policy.<br />
<br />
   As with any novice political leadership, the fifth generation leaders will<br />
   take office with little experience of what it means to be fully in charge<br />
   of a nation. Provincial leadership experience has provided good<br />
   preparation, but the individual members have not yet shown signs of<br />
   particularly strong national leadership capabilities: only a few of the<br />
   upcoming members of the Politburo Standing Committee are seen by the<br />
   public as having successfully taken charge during events of major<br />
   importance (for instance, Xi Jinping's response to Tropical Storm Bilis,<br />
   Wang Qishan's handling of the SARS epidemic and the Beijing Olympics);<br />
   only one has military experience (Xi Jinping, and it is slight); and only<br />
   a few of the others have shown independence or forcefulness in their<br />
   leadership style (namely Wang Qishan and Bo Xilai). The fact that the<br />
   future Politburo Standing Committee members will be chosen by the current<br />
   members or previous leaders (like former president Jiang Zemin), and only<br />
   after painstaking negotiations, may preserve the balance of power between<br />
   the cliques, but it may also result in a &quot;compromise&quot; leadership --<br />
   effectively one that would strive for the middle-of-the-road and achieve,<br />
   at best, mediocrity. A collective leadership of these members,<br />
   precariously balanced, runs the risk of falling into divisions when<br />
   resolute and sustained effort is necessary -- especially given the<br />
   economic, social and foreign policy challenges that it will likely face<br />
   during its tenure.<br />
<br />
   Yet this is by no means to say the fifth generation is destined to be weak<br />
   -- Chinese leaders have a time-tried strategy of remaining reserved for as<br />
   long as possible and not revealing their full strength until necessary.<br />
   Moreover China's centralist political system generally entails quick<br />
   implementation once the top leadership has made up its mind on a policy.<br />
   Still, judging by available criteria, the fifth generation leaders are<br />
   likely to be reactive, like the current administration -- and where they<br />
   are proactive it will be on decisions pertaining to domestic security and<br />
   social stability.<br />
<br />
   PART TWO -- MILITARY LEADERSHIP<br />
<br />
   China's military will see a sweeping change in leadership in 2012. The<br />
   military's influence over China's politics and policy has grown over the<br />
   past decade, as the country has striven to professionalize and modernize<br />
   its forces and expand their capabilities in response to deepening<br />
   international involvement and challenges to its internal stability. The<br />
   fifth generation military leaders are the first to have come out of the<br />
   military modernization process, and to have had their careers shaped by<br />
   the priorities of a China that has become a global economic power. They<br />
   will take office at a time when the military's budget, stature and<br />
   influence over politics is growing, and when it has come to see its role<br />
   as extending beyond that of a guarantor of national security to becoming a<br />
   guide for the country as it moves forward and up the ranks of<br />
   international power.<br />
<br />
   THE RISE OF THE PLA<br />
<br />
   After the economic reforms of Deng Xiaoping, the Chinese military began to<br />
   use its influence to get into industry and business. Over time this<br />
   evolved into a major role for the military on the local and provincial<br />
   level. Military commands supplemented their government budget allocations<br />
   with the proceeds from their business empires. Ultimately the central<br />
   government and party leadership became concerned that the situation could<br />
   degenerate into regional warlordism of the sort that has prevailed at<br />
   various times in Chinese history -- with military-political-business<br />
   alliances developing more loyalty to their interests and foreign partners<br />
   than to Beijing. Thus when Jiang Zemin launched full-scale reforms of the<br />
   military in the 1990s, he called for restructuring and modernization<br />
   (including cutting back China's bloated ground forces and boosting the<br />
   other branches of service) and simultaneously ordered the military to get<br />
   out of business. Though only complied with begrudgingly at first,<br />
   eventually the military-controlled businesses were liquidated and assets<br />
   sold (either at a bargain price to family members and cronies or at an<br />
   inflated price to local governments). To replace this loss of revenue<br />
   sources and redesign the military, the central government began increasing<br />
   budgetary allocations focusing on acquiring new equipment, higher<br />
   technology, and training and organization to promote professionalism. The<br />
   modernization drive eventually gave the military a new sense of purpose<br />
   and power and brought a greater role to the Second Artillery Corps (the<br />
   strategic missile corps), the PLA Air Force (PLAAF) and the PLA Navy<br />
   (PLAN).<br />
<br />
   The military's influence appears highly likely to continue rising in the<br />
   coming years for the following reasons: <br />
     * First, maintaining internal stability in China has resulted in several<br />
       high-profile cases in which the armed forces played a critical role.<br />
       Natural disasters such as massive flooding (1998, 2010) and<br />
       earthquakes (especially the one in Sichuan in 2008), have required the<br />
       military to provide relief and assistance, gaining more attention in<br />
       military planning and thereby improving the military's propaganda<br />
       efforts and public image and prestige. Because China is geographically<br />
       prone to natural disasters, and its environmental difficulties have<br />
       gotten worse as its massive population and economy have put greater<br />
       pressure on the landscape, the military is expected to continue<br />
       playing a greater role in disaster relief, including by offering to<br />
       help abroad [LINK]. At the same time, the rising frequency of social<br />
       unrest, including riots and ethnic violence in regions like Xinjiang<br />
       and Tibet, has led to military involvement. As the trend of rising<br />
       social unrest looks to continue in the coming years, so the military<br />
       will be called upon to restore order, especially through the elite<br />
       People's Armed Police, which is under the joint control of the CMC and<br />
       State Council.<br />
     * Second, as China's economy has risen to the rank of second largest in<br />
       the world, its international dependencies have increased. China<br />
       depends on stable and secure supply lines to maintain imports of<br />
       energy, raw materials, and components and exports of components and<br />
       finished goods. Most of these commodities and merchandise are traded<br />
       over sea, often through choke points such as the Strait of Hormuz and<br />
       Strait of Malacca, making them vulnerable to interference from piracy,<br />
       terrorism, conflicts between foreign states, or interdiction by navies<br />
       hostile to China (such as the United States, India or Japan).<br />
       Therefore it needs the People's Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) to expand<br />
       its capabilities and reach so as to secure these vital supplies --<br />
       otherwise the economy would be exposed to potential shocks that could<br />
       translate into social and political disturbances. This policy has also<br />
       led the PLA to take a more active role in United Nations peacekeeping<br />
       efforts and other international operations, expand integrated training<br />
       and ties with foreign militaries, and build a hospital ship to begin<br />
       military-led diplomacy.<br />
     * Third, competition with foreign states is intensifying as China has<br />
       become more economically powerful and internationally conspicuous. In<br />
       addition to mounting capabilities to assert its sovereignty over<br />
       Taiwan, China has become more aggressive in defending its sovereignty<br />
       and territorial claims in its neighboring seas -- especially in the<br />
       South China Sea, which Beijing elevated in 2010 to a &quot;core&quot; national<br />
       interest (along with sovereignty over Taiwan or Tibet), and also in<br />
       the East China Sea. This assertiveness has led to rising tension with<br />
       neighbors that have competing claims on potentially resource-rich<br />
       territory in the seas, including Vietnam, the Philippines, Indonesia,<br />
       Malaysia, Brunei, and also Japan. Moreover, Beijing's newfound<br />
       assertiveness has clashed with the United States' moves to bulk up its<br />
       alliances and partnerships in the region [LINK to US-SEA mega-piece],<br />
       which Beijing sees as a strategy aimed at constraining China's rise.<br />
       At the same time, China is raising its profile in international<br />
       missions other than war.<br />
     * Fourth, China's military modernization remains a primary national<br />
       policy focus. Military modernization includes acquiring and innovating<br />
       advanced weaponry, improving information technology and<br />
       communications, heightening capabilities on sea and in the air, and<br />
       developing capabilities in new theaters such as cyberwarfare and outer<br />
       space. It also entails improving Chinese forces' mobility, rapid<br />
       reaction, special forces and ability to conduct combined operations<br />
       between different military services. <br />
     * Lastly, the PLA has become more vocal in the public sphere, making<br />
       statements and issuing editorials in forums like the PLA Daily and,<br />
       for the most part, seeking positive public responses. In many cases<br />
       military officers have voiced a nationalistic point of view shared by<br />
       large portions of the public (however one prominent military officer,<br />
       Liu Yazhou, a princeling and commissar at National Defense University,<br />
       has used his standing to call for China to pursue western style<br />
       democratic political reforms). Military officials can strike a more<br />
       nationalist pose where politicians would have trouble due to<br />
       consideration for foreign relations and the concern that nationalism<br />
       is becoming an insuppressible force of its own.<br />
   Of course, a more influential military does not mean one that believes it<br />
   is all-powerful. China will still try to avoid direct confrontation with<br />
   the United States and its allies and maintain relations internationally,<br />
   given its national economic strategy and the fact that its military has<br />
   not yet attained the same degree of sophistication and capability as its<br />
   chief competitors. But the military's growing influence is likely to<br />
   encourage a more assertive China, especially in the face of heightened<br />
   internal and external threats.<br />
<br />
   THE CENTRAL MILITARY COMMISSION<br />
<br />
   The Central Military Commission (CMC) is the most powerful military body,<br />
   comprising the top ten military chiefs, and chaired by the country's<br />
   civilian leader. This means the CMC has unfettered access to the top<br />
   Chinese leader, and can influence him through a more direct channel than<br />
   through its small representation on the Politburo Central Committee. Thus<br />
   the CMC is not only the core decision-making body of the Chinese military,<br />
   but it is also the chief conduit through which the military can influence<br />
   the civilian leadership.<br />
<br />
   Promotions for China's top military leaders are based on the officer's<br />
   age, his current official position -- for instance, whether he sits on the<br />
   CMC or in the CPC Central Committee -- and his personal connections.<br />
   Officers born after 1947 will be too old for promotion since they will be<br />
   65 in 2012, which means they past the de facto cut-off age, above which an<br />
   officer is no longer eligible for promotion to the CMC. Those officers<br />
   fitting the age requirement and holding positions on the CMC,  the CPC<br />
   Central Committee, or a commander position in one of China's military<br />
   services or its seven regional military commands (or the parallel<br />
   political commissaries) may be eligible for promotion.<br />
<br />
   China's foremost leader, at the height of his power, serves simultaneously<br />
   as the president of the state, the general-secretary of the party, and the<br />
   chairman of the military commission, as President Hu Jintao currently<br />
   does. The top leader does not always hold all three positions -- Jiang<br />
   kept hold of his chair on the CMC for two years after his term as<br />
   president ended in 2002. Since Hu did not become CMC chairman until 2004,<br />
   he will presumably maintain his chair until 2014, two years after he gives<br />
   up his presidency and party throne. But this is a reasonable assumption,<br />
   not a settled fact, and some doubt Hu's strength in resolving such<br />
   questions in his favor.<br />
<br />
   Interestingly, Hu has not yet appointed Vice-President Xi Jinping to be<br />
   his successor on the CMC, creating a swirl of rumors over the past year<br />
   about whether Hu is reluctant to give Xi the vice-chairman post, or<br />
   whether Xi's position could be at risk. But Hu will almost certainly dub<br />
   Xi his successor as chairman of the CMC soon, probably in October. Given<br />
   the possibility that Hu could retain his CMC chairmanship till 2014, Xi's<br />
   influence over the military could remain subordinate to Hu's until that<br />
   time, raising uncertainties about how Hu and Xi will interact with each<br />
   other and with the military during this time. Otherwise Xi will be<br />
   expected to take over the top military post along with the top party and<br />
   state posts in 2012.<br />
<br />
   OLD AND NEW TRENDS<br />
<br />
   Of the leading military figures, there are several observable trends.<br />
   Regional favoritism in recruitment and promotion remains a powerful force,<br />
   and regions that have had the greatest representation on the CMC in the<br />
   past will retain their prominent place: Shandong, Hebei, Henan, Shaanxi<br />
   and Liaoning provinces, respectively, appear likely to remain the top<br />
   regions represented by the new leadership, according to research by Cheng<br />
   Li. These provinces are core provinces for the CPC's support base, and<br />
   there is considerably less representation in the upper officer corps from<br />
   Shanghai, Guangdong, or Sichuan, or the western regions, all of which are<br />
   known for regionalism and are more likely to stand at variance with<br />
   Beijing. (Which is not to say that other provinces, Sichuan for instance,<br />
   do not produce a large number of soldiers.)<br />
<br />
   One group of leaders, the princelings, are likely to take a much greater<br />
   role in the CMC in 2012 than in the current CMC, in great part because<br />
   these are the children or relatives of Communist Party revolutionary<br />
   heroes and elites and were born during the 1940s-50s. Examples include the<br />
   current naval commander and CMC member Wu Shengli, the political commissar<br />
   of the SAC Zhang Haiyang, and two deputy chiefs of the general staff, Ma<br />
   Xiaotian and Zhang Qinsheng. In politics the princelings are not<br />
   necessarily a coherent faction with agreed-upon policy leanings, though<br />
   princeling loyalties are reinforced by familial ties and inherited from<br />
   fathers, grandfathers and other relatives, they share similar elite<br />
   backgrounds, their careers have benefited from these privileges, and they<br />
   are viewed and treated as a single group by everyone else. In the<br />
   military, the princelings are more likely to form a unified group capable<br />
   of a coherent viewpoint, since the military is more rigidly hierarchical<br />
   and personal ties are based on staunch loyalty. The strong princeling<br />
   presence could constitute an interest group within the military leadership<br />
   capable of pressing more forcefully for its interests than it would<br />
   otherwise be able to do.<br />
<br />
   A marked difference in the upcoming CMC is the rising role of the PLA Navy<br />
   (PLAN), Air Force (PLAAF) and Second Artillery Corps (SAC, the strategic<br />
   missile corps), as against the traditionally dominant army. This<br />
   development was made possible by the enlargement of the CMC in 2004,<br />
   elevating the commanders of each of these non-army services to the CMC,<br />
   and it is expected to hold in 2012. The army will remain the most<br />
   influential service across the entire fifth generation military<br />
   leadership, with the missile corps, air force, and navy following close<br />
   behind. But crucially in the 2012 CMC the army's representation could<br />
   decline relative to the other branches of service, since of the three<br />
   members of the current CMC eligible to stay only one comes from the army<br />
   (Chang Wangquan), and many of the next highest candidates also hail from<br />
   other services. After all, missile capabilities and sea and air power are<br />
   increasingly important as China focuses on the ability to secure its<br />
   international supply chains and prevent greater foreign powers (namely the<br />
   United States) from approaching too closely areas of strategic concern.<br />
   The greater standing of the SAC, PLAN and PLAAF is already showing signs<br />
   of solidifying, since officers from these services used not to be<br />
   guaranteed representation on the CMC but now appear to have a permanent<br />
   place.<br />
<br />
   There is also a slight possibility that the two individuals chosen to be<br />
   the CMC vice-chairmen could both come from a background in military<br />
   operations. Typically the two vice-chairmen-- the most powerful military<br />
   leaders -- are divided between one officer centered on military operations<br />
   and another centered on political affairs. This ensures a civilian check<br />
   on military leadership, with the political commissar supervising the<br />
   military in normal times, and the military commander having ultimate<br />
   authority during times of war. However, given the candidates available for<br />
   the position, the precedent could be broken and the positions filled with<br />
   officers who both come from a military operational background. Such a<br />
   configuration in the CMC could result in higher emphasis put on the<br />
   capability and effectiveness of military rather than political solutions<br />
   to problems, and a CMC prone to bridle under CPC orders. But having two<br />
   military affairs specialists in the vice-chairmen seats is a slim<br />
   possibility, and there are available personnel from political affairs to<br />
   fill one of the vice-chairmanships, thus preserving the traditional<br />
   balance and the CPC's guidance over military affairs. <br />
<br />
   CIVILIAN LEADERSHIP MAINTAINED<br />
<br />
   The rising current of military power in the Chinese system could manifest<br />
   in any number of ways. Sources tell Stratfor that military officers who<br />
   retire sooner than civilian leaders may start to take up civilian<br />
   positions in the ministries or elsewhere in the state bureaucracy.<br />
   Nevertheless the overall arch of recent Chinese history has reinforced the<br />
   model of civilian leadership over military. The Communist Party retains<br />
   control of the CMC, the central and provincial bureaucracies, the<br />
   state-owned corporations and banks, mass organizations, and most of the<br />
   media. Moreover currently there does not appear to be a single military<br />
   strongman who could lead a significant challenge to civilian leadership.<br />
   So while the military's sway is undoubtedly rising, and the upcoming<br />
   civilian leadership could get caught in stalemate over policy,<br />
   nevertheless the military is not in the position to seize power. Rather it<br />
   is maneuvering to gain more of a say within the system, adding another<br />
   element of intrigue to the already tense bargaining structure that defines<br />
   elite politics in China. Despite possible military-civilian frictions, the<br />
   PLA will seek to preserve the regime, and to manage or suppress internal<br />
   or external forces that could jeopardize that goal.<br />
