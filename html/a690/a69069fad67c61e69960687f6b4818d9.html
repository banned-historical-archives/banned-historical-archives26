		<h3>Tor</h3>
		<p><a href="https://www.torproject.org">Tor</a> is an encrypted anonymising network that makes it harder to intercept internet communications, or see where communications are coming from or going to.</p>
		<p>In order to use the WikiLeaks public submission system as detailed above you can download the Tor Browser Bundle, which is a Firefox-like browser available for Windows, Mac OS X and GNU/Linux and pre-configured to connect using the anonymising system Tor.</p>
		<h4>Tails</h4>
		<p>If you are at high risk and you have the capacity to do so, you can also access the submission system through a secure operating system called <a href="https://tails.boum.org">Tails</a>. Tails is an operating system launched from a USB stick or a DVD that aim to leaves no traces when the computer is shut down after use and automatically routes your internet traffic through Tor. Tails will require you to have either a USB stick or a DVD at least 4GB big and a laptop or desktop computer.</p>

		<h3>Tips</h3>
		<p>Our submission system works hard to preserve your anonymity, but we recommend you also take some of your own precautions. Please review these basic guidelines. </p>
		<div>
			<h4>1. Contact us if you have specific problems</h4>
			<p>If you have a very large submission, or a submission with a complex format, or are a high-risk source, please <a href="#submit_help_contact">contact us</a>. In our experience it is always possible to find a custom solution for even the most seemingly difficult situations.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h4>2. What computer to use</h4>
			<p>If the computer you are uploading from could subsequently be audited in an investigation, consider using a computer that is not easily tied to you. Technical users can also use <a href="https://tails.boum.org">Tails</a> to help ensure you do not leave any records of your submission on the computer.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h4>3. Do not talk about your submission to others</h4>
			<p>If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in source protection – it is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This includes other media organisations.</p>
		</div>

	</div>

		<h3>After</h3>

		<div>
			<h4>1. Do not talk about your submission to others</h4>
			<p>If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in source protection – it is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This includes other media organisations.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h4>2. Act normal</h4>
			<p>If you are a high-risk source, avoid saying anything or doing anything after submitting which might promote suspicion. In particular, you should try to stick to your normal routine and behaviour.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h4>3. Remove traces of your submission</h4>
			<p>If you are a high-risk source and the computer you prepared your submission on, or uploaded it from, could subsequently be audited in an investigation, we recommend that you format and dispose of the computer hard drive and any other storage media you used.</p>
			<p>In particular, hard drives retain data after formatting which may be visible to a digital forensics team and flash media (USB sticks, memory cards and SSD drives) retain data even after a secure erasure. If you used flash media to store sensitive data, it is important to destroy the media.</p>
			<p>If you do this and are a high-risk source you should make sure there are no traces of the clean-up, since such traces themselves may draw suspicion.</p>
			<div>
				<h4>4. If you face legal action</h4>
				<p>If a legal action is brought against you as a result of your submission, there are organisations that may help you. The Courage Foundation is an international organisation dedicated to the protection of journalistic sources. You can find more details at <a href="https://www.couragefound.org">https://www.couragefound.org</a>.</p>

		<p>WikiLeaks publishes documents of political or historical importance that are censored or otherwise suppressed. We specialise in strategic global publishing and large archives.</p>
		<p>The following is the address of our secure site where you can anonymously upload your documents to WikiLeaks editors. You can only access this submissions system through Tor. (See our <a href="#submit_help_tor">Tor tab</a> for more information.) We also advise you to read our <a href="#submit_help_tips">tips for sources</a> before submitting.</p>

			<!--<div>
				Copy this address into your Tor browser. Advanced users, if they wish, can also add a further layer of encryption to their submission using <a href="#submit_wlkey">our public PGP key</a>.
			</div>-->
		</div>

		<p>If you cannot use Tor, or your submission is very large, or you have specific requirements, WikiLeaks provides several alternative methods. <a href="#submit_help_contact">Contact us</a> to discuss how to proceed.</p>

ON HUMAN RIGHTS PRACTICET IN THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF
CHINA. END SUMMARY.
2. THE PRC'S THIRTY YEAR RECORD ON HUMAN RIGHTS HAS
BEEN POOR BUT HAS IMPROVED DURING THE THREE YEARS SINCE
MAO'S DEATH AND THE PURGE OF THE GANG OF FOUR. CHINESE
AUTHORITIES APPEAR TO BE MAKING A SERIOUS EFFORT TO
IMPROVE RIGHTS OF CITIZIENS BY INSTITUTING A WORKING
LEGAL SYSTEM ALLOWING FOR A GREATER DEGREE OF POLITICAL
DISSENT, EASING EMIGRATION POLICIES AND INVOLVING A
GREATER NUMBER OF CITIZENS IN LOCAL ELECTIONS. THOUSANDS
OF &quot;RIGHTISTS,&quot; &quot;CAPITALIST ROADERS,&quot; SHCOLARS AND
OFFICIALS PURGED DURING THE NUMEROUS POLITICAL CAMPAIGNS
OF THE PAST 25 YEARS HAVE BEEN REHABILITATED. MANY HAVE
BEEN RESTORED TO POSITIONS OF AUTHORITY. UNDENIABLY,

CHINA IS A MUCH FREER PLACE THAN IT WAS THREE YEARS AGO
AT THE TIME OF MAO'S DEATH. THE PRESS IS LIVELIER,
DIFFERENCES OF OPINION ARE PUBLICALLY AIRED, CONTACTS
AND FIRENDSHIPS WITH FOREIGNERS ARE POSSIBLE (BUT STILL
LIMITED), AND THOUSANDS OF CHINESE SUTDENTS ARE GOING
OVERSEAS. CHINESE AUTHORITIES TODAY ARE MORE CONCERNED
ABOUT CITIZENS' RIGHTS THAN THEY EVER HAVE BEEN.

3. HOWEVER, THESE REFORMS HAVE NOT COMPLETELY BROKEN
THE PATTERN OF ARBITRARY ARRESTS AND PUNISHMENT WITHOUT
TRIAL FOR POLITICAL DISSENT. ACCORDING TO SEVERAL
ACCOUNTS, THE PRC STILL MAINTAINS A LARGE PRISON SYSTEM
AND NUMBEROUS CAMPS FOR &quot;REFORM THROUGH LABOR,&quot; PARTICULARLY IN REMOTE AREAS OF CHINA, MANY OF WHOSE INMATES
HAVE BEEN JAILED FOR POLITICAL CRIMES. AN EXTENSIVE
SECRET POLICE SYSTEM MONITORS THE POLITICAL ACTIVITIES
OF CHINA'S CITIZENS. THE CHINESE CULTURAL CONTXT HAS
NOT GENERALLY RESPECTED THE RIGHTS OF INDIVIDUALS.
CONFORMITY TO THE GROUP HAS TRADITIONALLY OVERRIDEN
POLITICAL AND SOCIAL FREEDOM. DEVIATION FROM ACCEPTABLE
SOCIAL AND POLITICAL NORMS, PARTICULARLY AFTER 1949,
HAS NOT BEEN TOLERATED AND HAS OFTEN RESULTED IN LENGTHY
PRISON TERMS AND SOCIAL OSTRACISM.
4. CHINA IS A DEVLOPING COUNTRY. RESOURCES ARE SCARECE
AND INADEQUATE DIET AND JOB OPPORTUNITIES HAVE CREATED
SIGNIFICANT FRUSTRATIONS THAT HAVE BOILED TO THE SURFACE
IN RECNET YEARS. THE PRC POLITICAL SYSTEM HAS OFTEN
REACTEDSTRONGLY AGAINST THESE FRUSTRATIONS, ATTEMPTING
TO KEEP A LID ON VISIBLE DISCONTENT. IN THE PAST YEAR,
WITH THE GENERAL LOOSENING OF POLITICAL CONTROLS,
THOUSANDS OF PEASANTS, FRUSTRATED YOUTH AND UNEMPLOYED
WORKERS HAVE DEMONSTRATED IN CHINA' MAJOR CITIES AND
UNCLASSIFIED
UNCLASSIFIED

BEIJIN 06858 01 OF 06 010503Z

&quot;PETITIONED&quot; PRC AUTHORITIES FOR REDRESS OF GRIEVANCES.
PRC AUTHORITIES HAVE TENDED TO TREAT PROTEST AS A
PROBLEM IN ITSELF,ARRESTING DEMONSTRATORS AND
SENDING THEM EITHER BACK TO THE COUNTRYSIDE OR TO LABOR
CAMPS. RECENTLY, HOWEVER, PRC LEADERS APPEAR TO BE TAKING
A MORE ENLIGHTENED APPROACH AND HAVE BEGUN TO DEAL WITH
THE &quot;PETITIONERS&quot; PROBLEMS.
5. CONSIDERABLE OFFICIAL ATTENTION IN CHINA HAS FOCUSED
ON THE GROSS VIOLATIONS OF HUMAN RIGHTS DURING THE GANG
OF FOUR EAR, PARTICULARLY FROM THE CULTURAL REVOLUTION
(1966-1969) UNTIL THE PURGE OF THE FOUR LEFTIST POLITBURO
MEMBERS AFTER CCP CHAIRMAN MAO ZEDONG'S DEATH IN 1976.
THE OFFICIAL MEDIA HAVE DETAILED NUMBEROUS EXAMPLES OF
HOW SOME SENIOR OFFICIAL OR ARTIST WAS &quot;PERSECUTED TO
DEATH,&quot; A EUPHEMISM FOR DEATH FROM BEATINGS BY RED
GURADS, ARBITRARY EXECUTION BY PUBLIC SECURITY OFFICIALS,
OR SUICIDE.
6. PRC LEADERS SEEM DETERMINED TO DEVELOP A LEGAL SYSTEM
THAT WOULD PREVENT THE UNCHECKED EXERCISE OF OFFICIAL
AUTHORITY. CHINA HAS NOT HAD A WORKING LEGAL SYSTEM FOR

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
MORE THAN TEN YEARS AND THE AVERAGE CITIZEN HAD NO REAL
RECOURSE OR PROTECTION UNDER DUE PROCESS. HE WAS
SUBJECT TO ARBITRARY ARRESTS BECAUSE OF AN OFF-HANDED
COMMENT, BECAUSE OF HIS CLASS BACKGROUND, OR BECAUSE HE
MIGHT HAVE SIDED WITH THE WRONG MEMBER OF HIS UNIT.
AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL ACCURATELY DOCUMENTED SOME OF
THESE CASES IN ITS 1978 REPORT TO CHINA.

7. DESPITE SIGNS OF IMPROVEMENT, PRC MEDIA AND OFFICIALS
STILL CONDEMN &quot;HUMAN RIGHTS&quot; AS A &quot;BOURGEOIS SLOGAN&quot;
WITHOUT ANY RELEVANCE IN CHINA TODAY. REN WANDING,
CHAIRMAN OF THE CHINA HUMAN RIGHTS ALLIANCE, WAS ARRESTED
APRIL 4 WHILE ATTEMPTING TO PUT UP A WALL POSTER CRIITCIZING PRC LEADERS'DISREGARD FOR HUMAN RIGHTS GUARANTEES.
PUTTING UP WALL POSTERS IS A RIGHT GUARANTEED BY THE
PRC CONSITUTION BUT IN FEBRUARY AND MARCH AUTHORITIES
ISSUED A PROCLAMATION FORBIDDING POSTERS CRITICAL OF
SOCIALISM. LAST WINTER, HUNDREDS OF YOUTHS IN CHINA'S
MAJOR CITIES SPOKE OUT AGAINST INEQUITIES IN THE POLITICAL
SYSTEM. SOME OPENLY PUBLISHED UNOFFICIAL JOURNALS, OTHERS
SPOKE AT RALLIES. SCORES OF THESE YOUTHS WERE ARRESTED
LAST SPRING AND ARE STILL BEING HELD IN PRISON WITHOUT
TRIAL. MANY OF THESE CASES HAVE RECEIVED CONSIDERABLE
ATTENTION IN THE FOREIGN MEDIA AND HAVE BEEN WIDELY
DISCUSSED AMONG INFORMED CHINESE. IN ADDITION, THE GANG
OF FOUR AND THOUSANDS OF THEIR ALLEGED FOLLOWERS HAVE
BEEN ARRESTED IN THE PAST THREE YEARS AND ARE PRESUMABLY
STILL BEING HELD WITHOUT TRIAL.
8. IN AUGUST AND SEPTEMBER 1979, MORE UNOFFICIAL JOURNALS

WALL. THE OFFICIAL MEDIA IS ALSO UNDERSCORING THE
IMPORTANCE OF FREE SPEECH AND EQUALITY BEFORE THE LAW.
RECENT TRENDS ARE ERRATIC BUT SEEM TO BE MOVING TOWARD
A FREER SOCIETY WITH GREATER RESPECT FOR INDIVIDUAL
RIGHTS. AT THE SAME TIME, RESPECT FOR INDIVIDUAL
FREEDOMS HAS NOT BEEN PART OF A POLITICAL SYSTEM THAT
HAS EMPHASIZED CONFORMITY AND &quot;UNITY&quot;. SUSTAINED RESPECT
FOR LAW AND HUMAN RIGHTS WILL NOT COME EASILY.
9. RESPECT FOR THE INTEGRITY OF THE PERSON, INCLUDING
FREEDOM FROM:
A. TORTURE: WE HAVE NO ACCURATE INFORMATION TO INDICATE
WHETHER OR NOT PRC AUTHORITIES ARE STILL USING TORTURE.
THE PRC MEDIAT HAVE DOCUMENTED NUMEROUS EXAMPLES OF
TORTURE AND MASS EXECUTIONS BY THE GANG OF FOUR DURING
AND AFTER THE CULTURAL REVOLUTION. TORTURE IS ILLEGAL
UNDER THE NEW CRIMINAL LAW ADPOPTED AT THE SECOND SESSION
OF THE 5TH NATIONAL PEOPLE'S CONGRESS WHICH GOES INTO
EFFECT JANUARY 1, 1980. CONSIDERABLE PSYCHOLOGICAL
COERCION, SUCH AS SUSTAINED GROUP INTERROGATION, IS
STILL USED, HOWEVER, TOWARD DISSIDENTS AND NONCONFORMISTS. ACCORDING TO SOME DISSIDENTS, PRC PRISON OFFICIALS
CONTINUE TO TORTURE (ELECTRIC SHOCK), BEAT AND STARVE
INMATES.
OTHER PRESSURES, SUCH AS THREATENED LOSS OF FOOD
RATIONS, JOBS, HOUSING AND OTHER ECONOMIC BENEFITS,
MAY ACCOMPNAY GROUP CRITICISM AND SUPERVISION. THE
NUMEROUS WALL PSSTERS APPEARING IN CHINA'S MAJOR CITIES
AND ACCOUNTS BY THE PETITIONERS WHO HAVE TRAVELED TO
BEIJING INDICATE THT SUCH PRACTICES ARE STILL WIDE
SPREAD. PRISONS AND &quot;PARTY SCHOOLS&quot; FOR POLITICAL AND

PUNISHMENT: CASES OF CRUEL PUNISHMENT CONTINUE TO BE
DOCUMENTED. NUMEROUS WALL POSTERS, COURT NOTICES AND
REFUGEE INTERVIEWS INDICATE THAT LENGTHY OR OPEN-ENDED

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
PRISON SENTENCES FOR POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC CRIMES
ARE STILL COMMON. THERE HAVE BEEN NO RECENT REPORTS OF
THE PRACTICE OF DRIVING PRISONERS THROUGH CITY STREETS
WHILE WEARING SIGNS WHICH INCITE CROWDS TO MAKE HOSTILE
COMMENT. THIS PRACTICE AS COMMON TWO YEARS AGO.
EXDCUTIONS FOR SERIOUS POLITICAL CRIMES APPEAR TO HAVE
ENDED AND THE PRC MEDIA HAVE CONDEMNED THE EXECUTION OF
A YOUTH WHO SPOKE OUT AGAINST MAO AND THE GANG OF FOUR
IN THE EARLY 1970S AS AN EXAMPLE OF THE TRANSGRESSION
OF POLITICAL AUTHORITY.
THE INTERNATIONAL COMMITTEE OF THE RED CROSS DOES
NOT HAVE ACESS TO DETAINEES. PRISONS ARE GENERALLY
NOT OPEN FOR INSPECTION BY FOREIGNERS.
C. ARBITRARY ARREST AND IMPRISONMENT: ARTICLE 47 OF
THE STATE CONSITUTION STATES THAT NO PERSON CAN BE
ARRESTED EXCEPT BY A DECISION OF A PEOPLE'S COURT OF
WITH THE SANCTION OF APEOPLE'S PROCURATORATE. ON
FEBRUARY 23, 1979 THE STANDING COMMITTEE OF THE NATIONAL
PEOPLE'S CONGRESS ADOPTED A 15-POINT REGULATION WHICH
DETAILED THE PROPER PROCEDURES FOR ARRESTS AND DETENTION

A FORM OF HABEAS CORPUS WAS WRITTEN INTO THE 15POINT ARREST DETENTION REGULATION, BUT IT HAS APPARENTLY NOT WORKED VERY WELL IN PRACTICE. THE FAMILY OF
ACTIVIST FU YUEHUA HAS REPEATEDLY PETITIONED THE COURS

D. DENIAL OF FAIR PUBLIC TRIAL: PUBLIC TRIAL WILL
BE GUARANTEED, EXCEPT FOR CASES INVOLVING &quot;STATE
SECRETS,&quot; &quot;PERSONAL SECRETS&quot; ANDJUVENILES, UNDER THE
192 ARTICLE CRIMINAL LAW WHICH WILL GO INTO EFFECT ON
JANUARY 1, 1980. PRC AUTHORITIES HAVE REFUSED TO
ALLOW FOREIGNERS TO OBSERVE CRIMINAL TRIALS, WITH ONE
OR TWO EXCEPTIONS. GENERALLY, CRIMINAL TRIALS HAVE
NOT BEEN PUBLIC IN CHINA BUT THE PRC HAS SHOWN SEVERAL
CRIMINAL TRIALS ON NATION-WIDE TELEVSION AS PART OF
THE CAMPAIGN TO EDUCATE THE NATION ON THE NEW LAWS.
BASED ON THE FEW TRIALS SEEN BY FOREIGNERS ON T.V.,
WHAT THE CHINESE CALL A &quot;TRIAL&quot; IS THE EQUIVALENT OF
A SENTENCING HEARING IN THE U.S. THE QUESTIONOF
INNOCENCE OR GUILT IS DETERMINED BEFOREHAND AFTER AN
INVESTIGATION BY THE PROSECUTOR, DURING WHICH THE
DEFENDANT'S RIGHT TO COUSEL IS UNCLEAR.
DEFENDANTS ARE ENTITLED TOCOUNSEL. BOTH THE
CONSTITUTION AND THE NEWLY ENACTED LAWS GIVE
DEFENDANTS A RIGHT TO COUNSEL. HOWEVER, NO SPECIFIC
PROVISION GRANTS THE RIGHT TO COUNSEL IN THE CRUCIAL
PRE-TRAIL INVESTIGATION PROCESS, WHERE THE DECISION
OF GUILT OR INNOCENCE IS USUALLY MADE. PRC OFFICIALS
HAVE, HOWEVER, INDICATED THAT DEFENDANTS CAN CONFER
IN PRIVATE WITH COUNSEL. IN THE FEW CASES SHOWN ON
TELEVISION, THE COUNSELS ACT AS ADVOCATES FOR MERCY
AND DID NOT CONTEST THE GUILT OF THE ACCUSED. THE PRC
HAS VIRTUALLY NO TRAINED LAWYERS, A DEFICIENCY THAT

PARTY MEMBERS CAN BE SUBJECTED TO OBSERVATION,

APPARENTLY NOT TRIED BY MILITARY COURTS. ALTHOUGH
SUMMARY EXECUTIONS HAVE TAKEN PLACE HERE, PARTICULARLY
DURING THE CULTURAL REVOLUTION, THERE HAVE BEEN NO
RECENT REPORTS OF THIS IN THE PAST TWO YEARS. GENERALLY,
CAPITAL PUNISHMENT HAS ONLY BEEN ADMINISTERED AFTER
APPROVAL AT A HIGH POLITICAL LEVEL.
E. INVASION OF THE HOME: ARTICLE 47 OF THE STATE
CONSTITUTION STATES THAT &quot;THE CITIZENS' FREEDOM OF
PERSON AND THEIR HOMES ARE INVIOLABLE.&quot; IN PRACTICE,
HOWEVER, THIS PROVISION SEEMS TO OFFER LITTLE OR
NO PROTECTION. LAST SPRING DURING THE ROUNDUP OF
DISSIDENTS, PRC PUBLIC SECURITY OFFICIALS SEARCHED
THE HOMES OF YOUTHS FOR INCRIMINATING EVIDENCE WITHOUT
NOTICE OR WARRANT AND CONFISCATED &quot;INCRIMINATING&quot;
EVIDENCE. THERE HAS BEEN NO ESTABLISHED PRACTICE FOR
THEUSE OF SEARCH WARRANTS, BUT SEARCH WARRANTS WILL
BE REQUIRED IN MOST CASES UNDER THE NEW CRIMINAL LAW

CHINESE COMMUNISTY IDEOLOGY TREATS RELIGION AS A

RELIGIOUS PRACTICE, HOWEVER. OFFICIALLY CONTROLLED
RELIGIOUS ORGANIZATIONS, SUCH AS THE CHINESE PARTRIOTIC

THE YWCA AND OTHER RELIGIOUS ORGANZIAGIONS HAVE

OFFICIALLY SNACTIONED CHURCHES HAVE BEEN TOLERATED FOR
YEARS BU THESE ARE GENERALLY NOT OPEN TO THE PUBLIC.
CHINESE OFFICIALS INDICATE THAT CONTROL OVER RELIGIOUS
PRACTICES WILL CONTINUE TO LOOSEN, PARTICULARLY FOR
RELIGIONS PRACTICED BY CHINESE MINORITIES. THE
OFFICIAL MEDIA HAVE ANNOUNCED THAT MANY OF CHINA'S

1. SUMMARY: THE FOLLOWING IS THE 1979 DRAFT REPORT
ON HUMAN RIGHTS PRACTICET IN THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF
CHINA. END SUMMARY.
2. THE PRC'S THIRTY YEAR RECORD ON HUMAN RIGHTS HAS
BEEN POOR BUT HAS IMPROVED DURING THE THREE YEARS SINCE
MAO'S DEATH AND THE PURGE OF THE GANG OF FOUR. CHINESE
AUTHORITIES APPEAR TO BE MAKING A SERIOUS EFFORT TO
IMPROVE RIGHTS OF CITIZIENS BY INSTITUTING A WORKING
LEGAL SYSTEM ALLOWING FOR A GREATER DEGREE OF POLITICAL
DISSENT, EASING EMIGRATION POLICIES AND INVOLVING A
GREATER NUMBER OF CITIZENS IN LOCAL ELECTIONS. THOUSANDS
OF &quot;RIGHTISTS,&quot; &quot;CAPITALIST ROADERS,&quot; SHCOLARS AND
OFFICIALS PURGED DURING THE NUMEROUS POLITICAL CAMPAIGNS
OF THE PAST 25 YEARS HAVE BEEN REHABILITATED. MANY HAVE
BEEN RESTORED TO POSITIONS OF AUTHORITY. UNDENIABLY,

CHINA IS A MUCH FREER PLACE THAN IT WAS THREE YEARS AGO
AT THE TIME OF MAO'S DEATH. THE PRESS IS LIVELIER,
DIFFERENCES OF OPINION ARE PUBLICALLY AIRED, CONTACTS
AND FIRENDSHIPS WITH FOREIGNERS ARE POSSIBLE (BUT STILL
LIMITED), AND THOUSANDS OF CHINESE SUTDENTS ARE GOING
OVERSEAS. CHINESE AUTHORITIES TODAY ARE MORE CONCERNED
ABOUT CITIZENS' RIGHTS THAN THEY EVER HAVE BEEN.

3. HOWEVER, THESE REFORMS HAVE NOT COMPLETELY BROKEN
THE PATTERN OF ARBITRARY ARRESTS AND PUNISHMENT WITHOUT
TRIAL FOR POLITICAL DISSENT. ACCORDING TO SEVERAL
ACCOUNTS, THE PRC STILL MAINTAINS A LARGE PRISON SYSTEM
AND NUMBEROUS CAMPS FOR &quot;REFORM THROUGH LABOR,&quot; PARTICULARLY IN REMOTE AREAS OF CHINA, MANY OF WHOSE INMATES
HAVE BEEN JAILED FOR POLITICAL CRIMES. AN EXTENSIVE
SECRET POLICE SYSTEM MONITORS THE POLITICAL ACTIVITIES
OF CHINA'S CITIZENS. THE CHINESE CULTURAL CONTXT HAS
NOT GENERALLY RESPECTED THE RIGHTS OF INDIVIDUALS.
CONFORMITY TO THE GROUP HAS TRADITIONALLY OVERRIDEN
POLITICAL AND SOCIAL FREEDOM. DEVIATION FROM ACCEPTABLE
SOCIAL AND POLITICAL NORMS, PARTICULARLY AFTER 1949,
HAS NOT BEEN TOLERATED AND HAS OFTEN RESULTED IN LENGTHY
PRISON TERMS AND SOCIAL OSTRACISM.
4. CHINA IS A DEVLOPING COUNTRY. RESOURCES ARE SCARECE
AND INADEQUATE DIET AND JOB OPPORTUNITIES HAVE CREATED
SIGNIFICANT FRUSTRATIONS THAT HAVE BOILED TO THE SURFACE
IN RECNET YEARS. THE PRC POLITICAL SYSTEM HAS OFTEN
REACTEDSTRONGLY AGAINST THESE FRUSTRATIONS, ATTEMPTING
TO KEEP A LID ON VISIBLE DISCONTENT. IN THE PAST YEAR,
WITH THE GENERAL LOOSENING OF POLITICAL CONTROLS,
THOUSANDS OF PEASANTS, FRUSTRATED YOUTH AND UNEMPLOYED
WORKERS HAVE DEMONSTRATED IN CHINA' MAJOR CITIES AND

PRC AUTHORITIES HAVE TENDED TO TREAT PROTEST AS A
PROBLEM IN ITSELF,ARRESTING DEMONSTRATORS AND
SENDING THEM EITHER BACK TO THE COUNTRYSIDE OR TO LABOR
CAMPS. RECENTLY, HOWEVER, PRC LEADERS APPEAR TO BE TAKING

SPOKE AT RALLIES. SCORES OF THESE YOUTHS WERE ARRESTED

A. TORTURE: WE HAVE NO ACCURATE INFORMATION TO INDICATE

EXDCUTIONS FOR SERIOUS POLITICAL CRIMES APPEAR TO HAVE

A YOUTH WHO SPOKE OUT AGAINST MAO AND THE GANG OF FOUR

NOT HAVE ACESS TO DETAINEES. PRISONS ARE GENERALLY
NOT OPEN FOR INSPECTION BY FOREIGNERS.

FEBRUARY 23, 1979 THE STANDING COMMITTEE OF THE NATIONAL
PEOPLE'S CONGRESS ADOPTED A 15-POINT REGULATION WHICH
DETAILED THE PROPER PROCEDURES FOR ARRESTS AND DETENTION
OF CITIZENS, INCLUDING PROVISION FOR ARREST WARRANTS,
NOTIFICATION OF CHARGES AND TIME LIMITS FOR FILING OF
FORMAL CHARGES. ACCORDING TO WALL POSTES AND CHINESE

SECRETS,&quot; &quot;PERSONAL SECRETS&quot; ANDJUVENILES, UNDER THE
192 ARTICLE CRIMINAL LAW WHICH WILL GO INTO EFFECT ON
JANUARY 1, 1980. PRC AUTHORITIES HAVE REFUSED TO
ALLOW FOREIGNERS TO OBSERVE CRIMINAL TRIALS, WITH ONE
OR TWO EXCEPTIONS. GENERALLY, CRIMINAL TRIALS HAVE
NOT BEEN PUBLIC IN CHINA BUT THE PRC HAS SHOWN SEVERAL
CRIMINAL TRIALS ON NATION-WIDE TELEVSION AS PART OF
THE CAMPAIGN TO EDUCATE THE NATION ON THE NEW LAWS.
BASED ON THE FEW TRIALS SEEN BY FOREIGNERS ON T.V.,

SUMMARY EXECUTIONS HAVE TAKEN PLACE HERE, PARTICULARLY
DURING THE CULTURAL REVOLUTION, THERE HAVE BEEN NO
RECENT REPORTS OF THIS IN THE PAST TWO YEARS. GENERALLY,
CAPITAL PUNISHMENT HAS ONLY BEEN ADMINISTERED AFTER
APPROVAL AT A HIGH POLITICAL LEVEL.
E. INVASION OF THE HOME: ARTICLE 47 OF THE STATE
CONSTITUTION STATES THAT &quot;THE CITIZENS' FREEDOM OF
PERSON AND THEIR HOMES ARE INVIOLABLE.&quot; IN PRACTICE,

ORGANIZATION HAS ALSO CABLED PREMIER HUA GUOFENG ON
SEVERAL OCCASIONS IN THE SPRING OF 1979 REGARDING THE
ARRESTS OF DISSIDENTS. THE CHINEESE HAVE NOT RESPONDED.
THERE IS NO DIALOGUE BETWEEN THE PRC AND OFFICIAL AND
NON-OFFICIAL INTERNATIONAL HUMAN RIGHTS ORGANIZATIONS.
CHINESE OFFICIALS REGARD SUCH ACTIONS AS INTERFERENCE
IN THE INTERNAL AFFAIRS OF CHINA.
WHEN ASKED ABOUT THE PRC'S HUMAN RIGHTS RECORD,
CHINESE LEADERS HAVE GENERALLY DODGED THE QUESTION AND
ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS HAVE NOTED THAT CHINA AND THE
WEST, PARTICULARLY THE UNITED STATES, HAVE DIFFERENT
VIEWS ON THE SUBJECT: THE OFFICIAL PRC MEDIA HAVE
CONDEMNED &quot;HUMAN RIGHTS&quot; AS A BOURGEOIS SLOGAN THAT
HAS NO MEANINGFUL APPLICATION IN CHINA. THE CONCEPT HAS
CLASS CONNOTATIONS, ACCORDING TO SEVERAL ARTICILES, AND
&quot;HUMAN RIGHTS&quot; REALLY MEANS PRIVILEGES FOR THE MONEYED
CLASS AND OPPRESSION FOR THE DOWNTRODDEN.
SEVERAL UNOFFICIAL CHINESE ORGANIZATIONS, ESPECIALLY
THE CHINA HUMAN RIGHTS ALLIANCE, HAVE ATTEMPTED TO MONITOR
CHINESE HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS. IN QOUON THESE ORGANIZATIONS SENT REPRESENTATIVE TO BEIJING MUNICIPAL COURTS
AND PUBLIC SECURITY ORGANS DEMANDING THE IMMEDIATE
RELEASE OF ARRESTED DISSIDENTS. CHINEESE AUTHORITIES
HAVE CONSISTENTLY REFUSED TO RESPOND TO SUCH QUERIES
AND PUBLIC SECURITY OFFICIALS HAVE HARASSED CITIZENS
WHO ATTEMPT TO PRESS FOR THE RELEASE OF &quot;PRISONERS OF
CONSCIENCE&quot;.
