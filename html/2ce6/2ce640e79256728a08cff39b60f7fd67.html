		<h3>Tor</h3>
		<p><a href="https://www.torproject.org">Tor</a> is an encrypted anonymising network that makes it harder to intercept internet communications, or see where communications are coming from or going to.</p>
		<p>In order to use the WikiLeaks public submission system as detailed above you can download the Tor Browser Bundle, which is a Firefox-like browser available for Windows, Mac OS X and GNU/Linux and pre-configured to connect using the anonymising system Tor.</p>
		<h4>Tails</h4>
		<p>If you are at high risk and you have the capacity to do so, you can also access the submission system through a secure operating system called <a href="https://tails.boum.org">Tails</a>. Tails is an operating system launched from a USB stick or a DVD that aim to leaves no traces when the computer is shut down after use and automatically routes your internet traffic through Tor. Tails will require you to have either a USB stick or a DVD at least 4GB big and a laptop or desktop computer.</p>

		<h3>Tips</h3>
		<p>Our submission system works hard to preserve your anonymity, but we recommend you also take some of your own precautions. Please review these basic guidelines. </p>
		<div>
			<h4>1. Contact us if you have specific problems</h4>
			<p>If you have a very large submission, or a submission with a complex format, or are a high-risk source, please <a href="#submit_help_contact">contact us</a>. In our experience it is always possible to find a custom solution for even the most seemingly difficult situations.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h4>2. What computer to use</h4>
			<p>If the computer you are uploading from could subsequently be audited in an investigation, consider using a computer that is not easily tied to you. Technical users can also use <a href="https://tails.boum.org">Tails</a> to help ensure you do not leave any records of your submission on the computer.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h4>3. Do not talk about your submission to others</h4>
			<p>If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in source protection – it is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This includes other media organisations.</p>
		</div>

	</div>

		<h3>After</h3>

		<div>
			<h4>1. Do not talk about your submission to others</h4>
			<p>If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in source protection – it is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This includes other media organisations.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h4>2. Act normal</h4>
			<p>If you are a high-risk source, avoid saying anything or doing anything after submitting which might promote suspicion. In particular, you should try to stick to your normal routine and behaviour.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h4>3. Remove traces of your submission</h4>
			<p>If you are a high-risk source and the computer you prepared your submission on, or uploaded it from, could subsequently be audited in an investigation, we recommend that you format and dispose of the computer hard drive and any other storage media you used.</p>
			<p>In particular, hard drives retain data after formatting which may be visible to a digital forensics team and flash media (USB sticks, memory cards and SSD drives) retain data even after a secure erasure. If you used flash media to store sensitive data, it is important to destroy the media.</p>
			<p>If you do this and are a high-risk source you should make sure there are no traces of the clean-up, since such traces themselves may draw suspicion.</p>
			<div>
				<h4>4. If you face legal action</h4>
				<p>If a legal action is brought against you as a result of your submission, there are organisations that may help you. The Courage Foundation is an international organisation dedicated to the protection of journalistic sources. You can find more details at <a href="https://www.couragefound.org">https://www.couragefound.org</a>.</p>

		<p>WikiLeaks publishes documents of political or historical importance that are censored or otherwise suppressed. We specialise in strategic global publishing and large archives.</p>
		<p>The following is the address of our secure site where you can anonymously upload your documents to WikiLeaks editors. You can only access this submissions system through Tor. (See our <a href="#submit_help_tor">Tor tab</a> for more information.) We also advise you to read our <a href="#submit_help_tips">tips for sources</a> before submitting.</p>

			<!--<div>
				Copy this address into your Tor browser. Advanced users, if they wish, can also add a further layer of encryption to their submission using <a href="#submit_wlkey">our public PGP key</a>.
			</div>-->
		</div>

		<p>If you cannot use Tor, or your submission is very large, or you have specific requirements, WikiLeaks provides several alternative methods. <a href="#submit_help_contact">Contact us</a> to discuss how to proceed.</p>

SAYS CHOU ONCE TOLD HIM &quot;DOOR BETWEEN OUR TWO NATIONS
SHOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN CLOSED.&quot;  SEES PRC OVERTURE AS
NIXON'S GREATEST FEAT--SINCE MEANT &quot;WE RECOGNIZE AT
LONG LAST THAT CHINA IS NOT PART OF A MONOLITHIC TWO-
PRONGED COMMUNIST MENACE,&quot; BUT &quot;IS GOING ITS OWN WAY IN ITS
OWN MANNER AND IS TRYING TO KEEP IN CONTROL OF ITS OWN

TO &quot;OVERSEAS WRITERS CLUB&quot; LUNCHEON, SAYING SINO-SOVIET
CHASM &quot;WILL REMAIN WIDE AND DEEP INTO THE INDEFINITE
FUTURE&quot; (GLOBE 11/14).

TO WP'S MATHEWS (HK 11/14), CHANGES WITHIN PRC DURING
&quot;ONE TUMULTUOUS MONTH&quot; FOLLOWING MAO'S DEATH ARE, IN
MANY RESPECTS, &quot;VICTORY FOR CHINESE HISTORY.&quot;  SAYS
FOR TIME BEING, AS HUA MOVES TO CONSOLIDATE HOLD ON
COUNTRY, CHINESE ARE LIKELY ENJOY ERA OF GOOD FEELING.
BUT CHINESE LONG-RANGE POL FUTURE LESS CERTAIN.  IN
IMPORTANT SENSE, EVENTS OF PAST MONTH HAVE REVIVED
MIDNIGHT ARREST AS TOOL OF CHINESE POLITICS.  SUGGESTS
WALLED-IN VILLAS OF CHUNGNANHAI DISTRICT FULL OF MEN/
WOMEN AMBITIOUS AS HUA OR CHIANG CHING; POINTS OUT
DISTRICT PERHAPS ALSO HOUSES TENG, WHO NOW HAS CHANCE
OF ANOTHER POL COMEBACK.  SUGGESTS HARD TO BELIEVE
HUA CAN AVOID POLICY/PERSONAL CLASHES WITH SOME OF THOSE
WHO HELPED HIM OUST RADICALS--AND HE HAS NOW SET PRE-
CEDENT FOR GRASPING POWER THROUGH SUDDEN, RUTHLESS
ACTION.  HUA'S COORDINATED EFFORT TO BLACKEN NAMES OF

IN 11/13 ARTICLE, MATHEWS SEES NCNA CHARGE--THAT &quot;GANG OF
FOUR&quot; CRIPPLED TANGSHAN QUAKE RELIEF EFFORTS--AS MOST
BITTER, PERHAPS MOST DAMAGING, ATTACK YET ON THEM, SINCE
ATTEMPTS SHOW THEY MADE LIGHT OF ONE OF WORST NATURAL
DISASTERS IN CHINESE HISTORY.  SAYS WHILE NO WAY VERIFY
ACCURACY OF CHARGE, AT TIME OF EARTHQUAKE NONE OF FOUR WAS
LISTED AS PART OF HAU-LED CENTRAL GOVT DEL T;AT RUSHED TO
TANGSHAN TWO DAYS LATER.  OBSERVES THAT, AS IS USUAL
PRACTICE IN CHINESE POL CAMPAIGN, MEDIA ATTACKS ON &quot;GANG

MIGHT HAVE HAD FOR THEM.

SUN'S ISAACS (HK 11/13) NOTES CHOU, WITH RADICALS IN DIS-
GRACE, IS ONCE AGAIN RECEIVING HONORS LONG CAREER
SHOULD HAVE EARNED HIM.  SUGGESTS TRIBUTES FOR CHOU MAY BE
MORE THAN JUST DELAYED HONOR, SINCE THEY INEVITABLY RAISE
POSSIBILITY OF REINSTATING TENG.  SAYS ASSUMED BY MOST
FOREIGN OBSERVERS THAT THERE ARE MEN IN NEW PRC LEADERSHIP
WHO WOULD WELCOME THEIR OLD COMRADE'S RETURN.  BUT ANALYSTS
NOT PREDICTING TENG COMEBACK, SINCE RETURNED TENG COULD
PROVE UNWELCOME CHALLENGE TO HUA.  AS VETERAN OF MORE THAN
40 YEARS, TENG HAS PERSONAL TIES WITH OTHER LEADERS THAT
HUA PROBABLY COULD NOT MATCH--FOR EXAMPLE, CHEN HSI-LIEN.

ZORZA (WP 11/13) SEES SOVIET EXTENSION FRIENDSHIP HAND TO

IT &quot;PRETTIFIES&quot; LIU SHAO-CHI.  BUT LESLIE CONCLUDES.

MOVIE SEEMS UNEXCEPTIONAL EXAMPLE OF HIGHLY SIMPLISTIC/

TO WP'S MATHEWS (HK 11/14), CHANGES WITHIN PRC DURING

FOR TIME BEING, AS HUA MOVES TO CONSOLIDATE HOLD ON
COUNTRY, CHINESE ARE LIKELY ENJOY ERA OF GOOD FEELING.
BUT CHINESE LONG-RANGE POL FUTURE LESS CERTAIN.  IN

FOUR&quot; CRIPPLED TANGSHAN QUAKE RELIEF EFFORTS--AS MOST
BITTER, PERHAPS MOST DAMAGING, ATTACK YET ON THEM, SINCE
ATTEMPTS SHOW THEY MADE LIGHT OF ONE OF WORST NATURAL
DISASTERS IN CHINESE HISTORY.  SAYS WHILE NO WAY VERIFY
ACCURACY OF CHARGE, AT TIME OF EARTHQUAKE NONE OF FOUR WAS
LISTED AS PART OF HAU-LED CENTRAL GOVT DEL T;AT RUSHED TO
TANGSHAN TWO DAYS LATER.  OBSERVES THAT, AS IS USUAL
PRACTICE IN CHINESE POL CAMPAIGN, MEDIA ATTACKS ON &quot;GANG

SUN'S ISAACS (HK 11/13) NOTES CHOU, WITH RADICALS IN DIS-
GRACE, IS ONCE AGAIN RECEIVING HONORS LONG CAREER

POSSIBILITY OF REINSTATING TENG.  SAYS ASSUMED BY MOST
FOREIGN OBSERVERS THAT THERE ARE MEN IN NEW PRC LEADERSHIP
WHO WOULD WELCOME THEIR OLD COMRADE'S RETURN.  BUT ANALYSTS
NOT PREDICTING TENG COMEBACK, SINCE RETURNED TENG COULD
PROVE UNWELCOME CHALLENGE TO HUA.  AS VETERAN OF MORE THAN

MOVIE SEEMS UNEXCEPTIONAL EXAMPLE OF HIGHLY SIMPLISTIC/
