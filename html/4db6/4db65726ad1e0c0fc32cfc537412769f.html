		<h3>Tor</h3>
		<p><a href="https://www.torproject.org">Tor</a> is an encrypted anonymising network that makes it harder to intercept internet communications, or see where communications are coming from or going to.</p>
		<p>In order to use the WikiLeaks public submission system as detailed above you can download the Tor Browser Bundle, which is a Firefox-like browser available for Windows, Mac OS X and GNU/Linux and pre-configured to connect using the anonymising system Tor.</p>
		<h4>Tails</h4>
		<p>If you are at high risk and you have the capacity to do so, you can also access the submission system through a secure operating system called <a href="https://tails.boum.org">Tails</a>. Tails is an operating system launched from a USB stick or a DVD that aim to leaves no traces when the computer is shut down after use and automatically routes your internet traffic through Tor. Tails will require you to have either a USB stick or a DVD at least 4GB big and a laptop or desktop computer.</p>

		<h3>Tips</h3>
		<p>Our submission system works hard to preserve your anonymity, but we recommend you also take some of your own precautions. Please review these basic guidelines. </p>
		<div>
			<h4>1. Contact us if you have specific problems</h4>
			<p>If you have a very large submission, or a submission with a complex format, or are a high-risk source, please <a href="#submit_help_contact">contact us</a>. In our experience it is always possible to find a custom solution for even the most seemingly difficult situations.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h4>2. What computer to use</h4>
			<p>If the computer you are uploading from could subsequently be audited in an investigation, consider using a computer that is not easily tied to you. Technical users can also use <a href="https://tails.boum.org">Tails</a> to help ensure you do not leave any records of your submission on the computer.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h4>3. Do not talk about your submission to others</h4>
			<p>If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in source protection – it is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This includes other media organisations.</p>
		</div>

	</div>

		<h3>After</h3>

		<div>
			<h4>1. Do not talk about your submission to others</h4>
			<p>If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in source protection – it is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This includes other media organisations.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h4>2. Act normal</h4>
			<p>If you are a high-risk source, avoid saying anything or doing anything after submitting which might promote suspicion. In particular, you should try to stick to your normal routine and behaviour.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h4>3. Remove traces of your submission</h4>
			<p>If you are a high-risk source and the computer you prepared your submission on, or uploaded it from, could subsequently be audited in an investigation, we recommend that you format and dispose of the computer hard drive and any other storage media you used.</p>
			<p>In particular, hard drives retain data after formatting which may be visible to a digital forensics team and flash media (USB sticks, memory cards and SSD drives) retain data even after a secure erasure. If you used flash media to store sensitive data, it is important to destroy the media.</p>
			<p>If you do this and are a high-risk source you should make sure there are no traces of the clean-up, since such traces themselves may draw suspicion.</p>
			<div>
				<h4>4. If you face legal action</h4>
				<p>If a legal action is brought against you as a result of your submission, there are organisations that may help you. The Courage Foundation is an international organisation dedicated to the protection of journalistic sources. You can find more details at <a href="https://www.couragefound.org">https://www.couragefound.org</a>.</p>

		<p>WikiLeaks publishes documents of political or historical importance that are censored or otherwise suppressed. We specialise in strategic global publishing and large archives.</p>
		<p>The following is the address of our secure site where you can anonymously upload your documents to WikiLeaks editors. You can only access this submissions system through Tor. (See our <a href="#submit_help_tor">Tor tab</a> for more information.) We also advise you to read our <a href="#submit_help_tips">tips for sources</a> before submitting.</p>

			<!--<div>
				Copy this address into your Tor browser. Advanced users, if they wish, can also add a further layer of encryption to their submission using <a href="#submit_wlkey">our public PGP key</a>.
			</div>-->
		</div>

		<p>If you cannot use Tor, or your submission is very large, or you have specific requirements, WikiLeaks provides several alternative methods. <a href="#submit_help_contact">Contact us</a> to discuss how to proceed.</p>

THE FOLLOWING IS A TRANSCRIPT OF THE DISCUSSION BETWEEN
VICE PREMIER DENG XIAOPING (TENG HSIAO-PING) AND CODEL NUNN
JANUARY 9, 1979:
BEGIN TEXT.
SENATOR NUNN: IT IS A GREAT HONOR TO MEET WITH YOU. AS THE
FIRST AMERICAN CONGRESSIONAL DELEGATION TO VISIT CHINA AFTER
NORMALIZATION, WE ARE IN SOMEWHAT OF A UNIQUE POSITION. I
PREVIOUSLY HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO MEET YOU IN 1975 WHEN I
VISITED CHINA WITH SENATOR BYRD. I WAS HIGHLY IMPRESSED
THEN AND I AM ESPECIALLY HONORED TO AGAIN HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO MEET WITH YOU THIS TIME.

VICE PREMIER DENG: I HAVE HEARD THAT THREE OF THE FOUR OF
YOU HAVE BEEN HERE BEFORE.
NUNN: YES, SENATOR HART AND I ARE GATHERING INFORMATION
FOR A STUDY OF UNITED STATES FORCE STRUCTURE IN THE ASIAN
AND PACIFIC REGION. WE WILL, ON OUR RETURN, REPORT TO THE

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
ARMED SERVICES COMMITTEE ON OUR FINDINGS IN CHINA, THE
PHILIPPINES, SOUTH KOREA AND JAPAN. SENATOR GLENN IS THE
CHAIRMAN OF THE FOREIGN RELATIONS SUBCOMMITTEE ON ASIAN
AFFAIRS. HE IS, OF COURSE, A FORMER ASTRONAUT AND HAS A
SUBSTANTIAL MILITARY BACKGROUND. SENATOR COHEN HAS SERVED
FOR SIX YEARS IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES AND NOW IS
JOINING THE SENATE. HE WILL PROBABLY SERVE ON THED
SERVICES COMMITTEE OR THE FOREIGN RELATIONS COMMITTEE.
DENG: (JOKES ABOUT SENATOR GLENN HAVING COME FROM &quot;CELESTIAL
REGIONS&quot;). I WELCOME THE OPPORTUNITY TO EXCHANGE VIEWS WITH
YOUR DELEGATION, PARTICULARLY, SINCE YOU WERE THE FIRST US
DELEGATION TO COME AFTER THE OPENING OF DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS.
NUNN: WE HAVE MANY QUESTIONS AND OUR TIME IS INSUFFICIENT.
WITH REGARD TO THE CONFIDENTIALITY OF OUR DISCUSSION, NATURALLY
THE NEWS MEDIA ARE INTENSELY CURIOUS ABOUT EVERYTHING YOU
SAY. WE WILL, OF COURSE, RESPECT ANYTHING THAT YOU WANT
KEPT CONFIDENTIAL.
DENG: MY HOPE IS THAT YOU WILL NOT QUOTE DIRECTLY WHAT I
SAY. WE MIGHT THUS HAVE A FREER DISCUSSION.
NUNN: WE CAN PASS ON OUR IMPRESSIONS WITHOUT ATTRIBUTION?
DENG: THAT IS RIGHT.

NUNN: ONE OF OUR AREAS OF CONCERN IS THE SITUATION IN KOREA.
OUR TWO COUNTRIES HAVE MADE GREAT PROGRESS IN NORMALIZING
OUR RELATIONS. IT WOULD BE TRAGIC IF AN OUTBREAK IN KOREA
WERE TO TAKE PLACE. I KNOW THAT YOU TOO ARE CONCERNED. OUR
INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY HAS TOLD US THAT THERE ARE MORE POWERFUL
FORCES IN THE NORTH THAN WE HAD PREVIOUSLY THOUGHT. IF THE
UNITED STATES WERE TO TALK TO SOUTH KOREA AND CHINA TO NORTH
KOREA, OUR COOPERATION COULD REDUCE TENSION AND PERHAPS
BRING ABOUT DIRECT TALKS BETWEEN THE TWO.
DENG: IN THE PAST OTHER US FRIENDS HAVE BROUGHT UP THIS
QUESTION. DURING MY TRIP TO JAPAN, JAPANESE LEADERS POSED
THE SAME QUESTION TO ME. IN POSING SUCH QUESTIONS, PEOPLE
EXPRESSED APPREHENSION OF POSSIBLE MILITARY ACTIVITIES ON
THE PART OF NORTH KOREA. THE JAPANESE WERE APPREHENSIVE
AND SPOKE TO ME OF A VERY TENSE SITUATION IN KOREA. ON THAT
OCCASION WE WERE TOLD BY JAPANESE LEADERS THAT JAPAN HAD THE
SAME IMPRESSION OF THE EXISTENCE OF TENSIONS IN KOREA. THERE
IS NO QUESTION OF THE DPRK WAGING AN OFFENSIVE. WE SAID
THEN THAT WE ARE AWARE OF THE FOLLOWING FACTS. WE FAITH
IN WHAT KIM IL SONG HAS SAID ABOUT PEACEFUL REUNIFICATION

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
AND WE HAVE RENDERED OUR CONSISTENT SUPPORT TO THAT POLICY.
I SAY TO OUR AMERICAN AND JAPANESE FRIENDS WHAT DESERVES
ATTENTION IS THAT PEACEFUL AND INDEPENDENT REUNIFICATION
AS SPOKEN OF IN NORTH KOREAN POLICY MEANS REUNIFICATION
IN A PEACEFUL MANNER. WE UNDERSTAND THAT THOROUGHLY. IN
MY VIEW, THERE IS SOME INFORMATION THAT IS NOT CORRECT IN
THIS REGARD. WE ARE ON GOOD TERMS WITH THE DPRK AND WE UNDERSTAND THEIR SITUATION. YOU SHOULD UNDERSTAND THE FOLLOWING
FACTS. IN THE PAST PRESIDENT KIM IL SONG AND NORTH KOREA
SOUGHT TO HOLD DIRECT TALKS WITH THE SOUTH KOREAN AUTHORITIES.
LATER ON THE SOUTH KOREAN AUTHORITIES SUSPENDED THOSE TALKS.
WE ARE ALSO AWARE OF THE FACT THAT KIM WANTS VERY MUCH TO
RESUME TALKS WITH KOREA. WHILE WE DESIRE THAT NEGOTIATIONS
RESUME, WE ALSO EXPRESS THE HOPE THAT SINCE SOUTH KOREA

CINCPAC FOR POLAD
THE GOVERNMENT IN SOUTH KOREA REPRESENTED BY PARK AND THE
DEMOCRATIC PARTIES IN SOUTH KOREA WILL INITIATE DISCUSSIONS.

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
I WONDER IF THE UNITED STATES WILL HELP BRING ABOUT DIRECT
TALKS. THERE IS NO QUESTION THAT NORTH KOREA DESIRES THEIR
RESUMPTION.
NUNN: WE WOULD WELCOME SUCH A DEVELOPMENT. BUT THE INCLUSION
OF OPPONENTS OF THE PRESENT GOVERNMENT IN SOUTH KOREA SEEMS
UNREALISTIC AND SEEMS TO BE TANTAMOUNT TO THE NORTH SAYING
THAT THEY DON'T WANT DIRECT DISCUSSIONS. I DO BELIEVE THAT
CHINA AND NORTH KOREA, THE UNITED STATES AND SOUTH KOREA
HAVE A CONSIDERABLE AREA TO WORK IN. VIOLENCE IN THIS REGION
WOULD BE A BLOW TO BOTH OF OUR INTERESTS. OUR RELATIONSHIP
SHOULD NOT BE SUBJECT TO SUCH RISKS.
DENG: I WOULD LIKE TO REPEAT MY POINT. WE DON'T FEEL SUCH
TENSION IN THE SITUATION. AS FAR AS CHINA IS CONCERNED,
YEARS AGO THE UNITED STATES MADE SUCH A PROPOSAL. CHINA HAS
CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL
PAGE 02

PEKING 00162 02 OF 05 110836Z

NO DIRECT RESPONSIBILITY IN THIS AREA. THE UNITED STATES
HAS; THE UNITED STATES HAS TROOPS THERE. THE U.S. SHOULD
ENTER INTO A DIRECT DIALOGUE. THROUGH A DIRECT DIALOGUE THE
TWO SIDES CAN GET A DEEPER KNOWLEDGE OF EACH OTHER.
ANYWAY WE HOPE THAT THIS MATTER SHOULD NOT INVOLVE
THE FOUR PARTIES. WE HAVE NO TROUBLES IN KOREA. WHEN I WAS
IN JAPAN, THE JAPANESE SUGGESTED THAT CHINA SHOULD WORK
WITH NORTH KOREA AND JAPAN WITH SOUTH KOREA.
WE SAID THIS WAS UNREALISTIC. ASAID TO THE JAPANESE
LEADERS IN EXPLICIT TERMS THAT CHINA AND NORTH KOREA HAVE
A GOOD RELATIONSHIP BECAUSE WE DO NOT INTERFERE IN NORTH
KOREAN AFFAIRS. WHAT WE CAN DO IS TO CONVEY THE NORTH KOREAN
POSITION TO YOU. I HOPE YOU WILL CONVEY NORTH KOREAN IDEAS
TO THE SOUTH KOREAN AUTHORITIES. WE THINK THIS APPROACH
HAS MERIT.
NUNN: WE HOPE THE TWO SIDES CAN TALK DIRECTLY. CHINA HAS
MUCH INFLUENCE IN THE AREA. IN ANY CASE, WE HOPE THAT BOTH
SIDES CAN PEACEFULLY RESOLVE THE PROBLEM.
DENG: I SAY TO YOU FROM DEEP IN MY HEART THAT OVERT INTERFERENCE IN A NATION'S AFFAIRS CAN ONLY ACHIEVE THE OPPOSITE OF
WHAT IS INTENDED. CHINA AND NORTH KOREA ENJOY GOOD RELATIONS
BECAUSE WE FULLY RESPECT THEM AND DO NOT INTERFERE IN THEIR
AFFAIRS. I CAN TELL YOU SOMETHING WHICH HAS NOT BEEN PUBLICIZED: THE REASON NORTH KOREAN AND SOVIET RELATIONS ARE BAD
IS BECAUSE THE SOVIETS INTERFERED IN NORTH KOREAN AFFAIRS.
THE SOVIET UNION HAS TRIED TO USE ITS AID TO NORTH KOREA
TO ASSERT INFLUENCE AND CONTROL AND THAT IS WHY RELATIONS
ARE BAD. ANOTHER POINT: OUR POSITION WOULD BE BETTER IF
US TROOPS DISENGAGED FROM SOUTH KOREA. WHEN I WAS IN JAPAN,
JAPANESE LEADERS ASKED ME IF IN SO DOING, US STRENGTH IN

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
EAST ASIA AND THE PACIFIC WOULD BE WEAKENED. I SAID TO THEM
CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL
PAGE 03

PEKING 00162 02 OF 05 110836Z

THAT TO MOVE US TROOPS SEVERAL HUNDRED KILOMETERS WOULD
NOT WEAKEN STRENGTH IN THE REGION. OTHERS QUESTIONED WHETHER
THE WITHDRAWAL WOULD LEAD TO A NORTH KOREAN OFFENSIVE. I
SAY THAT THE MILITARY STRENGTH OF SOUTH KOREA IS NO LOWER
THAN THAT OF NORTH KOREA.
SENATOR GLENN: I WOULD LIKE TO CONGRATULATE YOU ON THE
INITIATIVE TAKEN TO RESTORE RELATIONS BETWEEN OUR COUNTRIES.
I WOULD LIKE TO EXPLORE A DIFFERENCE AREA. FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS
OFTEN DO NOT UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE OF THE CONGRESSIONAL
INPUT INTO OUR CONDUCT OF FOREIGN RELATIONS. AS WE MOVE
INTO AGREEMENTS TO MAKE NORMALIZATORK ON SUCH MATTERS
AS CLAIMS AND ASSETS, LOANS, OUR FUTURE FINANCIAL RELATIONS,
ALL OF THESE MUST BE APPROVED BY CONGRESS. DIFFICULTIES
IN THIS AREA COULD UPSET AND RUIN THE NEW RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN
THE TWO COUNTRIES. CONGRESS IS SENSITIVE TO THE MOOD OF
THE PEOPLE. WE HAVE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE WHO ARE STILL CONCERNED
ABOUT THE SECURITY IN TAIWAN. I HAVE FOLLOWED CLOSELY THE
STATEMENTS THAT THE VICE PREMIER HAS MADE AND HAVE BEEN
GRATIFIED AND HAPPY TO HEAR WHAT HE HAS HAD TO SAY ABOUT
THE USE OF PEACEFUL MEANS. IF WE ARE TO REALIZE THE GOOD
THINGS THAT SHOULD FLOW FROM NORMALIZATION THEN THE PEOPLE
OF THE UNITED STATES MUST GET BEHIND THE NORMALIZATION PROCESS.
WHEN VICE PREMIER TENG VISITS THE UNITED STATES THE AMERICAN
PEOPLE WILL BE MORE IMPRESSED THAN ANYTHING ELSE BY STATEMENTS
ON PEACEFUL REUNIFICATION. THIS WILL DO MORE TO GET PUBLIC
OPINION BEHIND MOST FAVORED NATION STATUS, A CLAIMS AND
ASSETS SETTLEMENT, AND FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS THAT WILL BE
MOST BENEFICIAL TO THE TWO COUNTRIES.
DENG: OUR POSITION ON THIS QUESTION IS CLEAR-CUT. AMBASSADOR
WOODCOCK, I THINK, IS MOST WELL INFORMED ABOUT OUR POSITION.
WE HAVE COVERED THIS QUESTION WITH MANY US DELEGATIONS. AS
FAR AS CHINA IS CONCERNED, OF COURSE, WE HOPE TO USE AND
ARE PURSUING A PROCESS OF PEACEFUL REUNIFICATION AND A RETURN
TO THE MOTHERLAND OF TAIWAN. HOWEVER, WE HAVE ALWAYS ADHERED

TO THE POINT THAT HOW THIS REUNIFICATION IS ACCOMPLISHED
IS AN INTERNAL CHINESE QUESTION. THE REASON WE CANNOT UNILATERALLY SAY THAT WE ARE NOT GOING TO USE FORCE TO SETTLE
THE QUESTION OF TAIWAN IS BECAUSE IF WE SHOULD UNDERTAKE
SUCH A COMMITMENT THEN THE QUESTION COULD NOT BE SETTLED
IN A PEACEFUL MANNER, BECAUSE SUCH A COMMITMENT WOULD BE
EQUIVALENT TO BINDING CHINESE HANDS. I TOLD THE AMERICAN
CORRESPONDENTS THAT WE CAN'T TIE OUR OWN HANDS. THE REASON
IS THAT IF WE DO, THEN TAIWAN AUTHORITIES LED BY CHIANG
CHING-KUO WOULD BECOME RECKLESS AND SUCH ACTION WOULD LEAD
TO THE CONSEQUENCE THAT TAIWAN WOULD ENTER INTO NO TALKS
AT ALL. WHAT WILL THE CONSEQUENCE BE IF WE SAY WE WILL NOT
USE FORCE AND ONE OR TWO YEARS GO BY WITHOUT TALKS, AND
THAT IS ALL RIGHT, BUT AFTER TEN YEARS? WHAT HAPPENS? IF
CHINA JUST HAS ONE HAND THIS WILL LEAD TO A SETTLEMENT BY
ARMED FORCE.
LET ALL OF US ANALYZE THE PROBLEM IN PERSPECTIVE. THERE
ARE ONLY TWO CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE FORCE WOULD BE USED. THE
CONFIDENTIAL

PEKING 00162 03 OF 05 110756Z

FIRST CIRCUMSTANCE, IF IN TAKING ADVANTAGE OF CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES IN THE WORLD, TAIWAN ABSOLUTELY REFUSES TO ENTER
INTO TALKS WITH US. THAT IS, WE HAVE ADOPTED A REALISTIC
APPROACH TOWARDS THE QUESTION OF TAIWAN AFTER REUNIFICATION.

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
THIS REALISTIC APPROACH INCLUDES THE ABILITY OF TAIWAN TO
MAINTAIN A PEOPLE-TO-PEOPLE RELATIONSHIP WITH JAPAN AND
THE UNITED ST THERE WOULD BE NO CHANGE IN SOCIAL CONDITIONS.
THE PEOPLE'S LIVING STANDARD WOULD IMPROVE. IF WE PERMIT
ALL THIS AND THE TAIWAN AUTHORITIES STILL DO NOT WANT TO
TALK, WHAT IS TO BE DONE? THE SECOND CIRCUMSTANCE WOULD BE
AS FOLLOWS: DURING THE COURSE OF NEGOTIATIONS SOME PEOPLE
POINTED OUT THE POSSIBILITY OF THE SOVIETS GETTING INTO
TAIWAN AFTER NORMALIZATION. OUR US FRIENDS ON SEVERAL DELEGATIONS POSED THE SAME QUESTION. WE SEE NO SUCH THREAT.
CHIANG WOULD FIND IT VERY DIFFICULT TO CONTEMPLATE GOOD
RELATIONS WITH THE SOVIET UNION.
WHILE ON THAT SUBJECT, BESIDES THE PURELY CHINESE ASPECT,
THE US WOULD STILL HAVE PEOPLE-TO-PEOPLE CONTACTS AND WOULD
STILL HAVE A LARGE ECONOMIC RELATIONSHIP. JAPAN WOULD ALSO
SUFFER IF CHIANG CHING-KUO WERE TO EMBARK ON SUCH A COURSE.
AND THEN, I COUNTER THE QUESTION TO MANY US FRIENDS, SUPPOSE
THE SOVIET UNION WERE TO OCCUPY TAIWAN. THEN I ASSUME THE
US WOULD NOT OPPOSE CHINA USING FORCE. THAT IS WHY WE CANNOT
BIND OUR HANDS. YOU MUST HAVE NOTICED OUR MESSAGE TO OUR
FRIENDS ON TAIWAN. THE TONE OF OUR MESSAGE IS ALWAYS REASONABLE.
I HOPE I HAVE EXPLAINED MY VIEWS CLEARLY.
NUNN: I COMMEND THE WAY YOU HAVE HANDLED THIS QUSETION. I
THINK YOU HAVE IMPRESSED THE AMERICAN PEOPLE OF YOUR PEACEFUL
INTENTIONS. AFTER REUNIFICATION COULD IT BE POSSIBLE FOR
TAIWAN TO MAINTAIN SECURITY FORCES?
TENG: THERE WILL BE NO DIFFICULTY. THERE WILL BE NO CHANGE

IN THE SOCIAL SOCIETY OR IN THE WAY OF LIFE, AND THE TAIWAN
AUTHORITIES WILL POSSESS THE SAME POWER THEY POSSESS NOW.
THE ONLY THING THEY HAVE TO DO IS DROP THE ROC FLAG. TAIWAN
IS PART OF CHINESE TERRITORY. WE EXTEND A WELCOME TO THEM
TO ENJOY FULL AUTONOMY. AFTERWARDS, WITH THE DEVELOPMENT
OF THE CHINESE ECONOMY AND THE INCREASE OF CONTACTS BETWEEN
THE TWO SIDES (THERE WILL BE A CLOSER RELATIONSHIP).
NUNN: THEN WE ARE TO UNDERSTAND THATQUESTION OF SECURITY
FORCES COULD BE WORKED OUT OVER TIME. THE TAIWAN AUTHORITIES
COULD MAINTAIN SECURITY FORCES OVER A PERIOD OF TIME WITHOUT
BEING DISARMED?
DENG: NO, THERE IS NO NEED.
NUNN: THAT SHOULD BE A HELP IN INITIATING MEANINGFUL DISCUSSIONS.
DENG: EVEN IF WE ADOPT SUCH A POSTURE IT WILL NOT BE SO

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
EASY. IN MY VIEW THE US SIDE CAN HELP. WE THINK OUR DEMANDS
ARE RATIONAL. CHAIRMAN MAO AND ZHOU ENLAI (CHOU EN-LAI) HAD
THE SAME CONCEPT THAT WE HAVE JUST MENTIONED.
TIBET IS A CASE IN POINT. BEFORE THE DALAI LAMA BETRAYED
US, WE SAID WE WOULD NOT CARRY OUT REVISIONS IN TIBET. THAT
MEANT THAT THE DALAI LAMA COULD MAINTAIN THE SLAVE SYSTEM.
WE DID NOT INSTITUTE DEMOCRATIC REFORMS FOR TEN YEARS. IT
WAS NOT CARRIED OUT UNTIL THE DALAI LAMA LEFT. IF HE WANTS
TO COME BACK NOW HE IS WELCOME.
ANOTHER EXAMPLE: YOU KNOW ABOUT THE QUESTION OF HONG
KONG AND MACAO. CHINA ALWAYS CONSIDERS SUCH QUESTIONS FROM
AN OVERALL POLITICAL PERSPECTIVE. THE REASON WHY WE SAY
WE NEED TWO HANDS IS THAT WE APPROACH THE QUESTION FROM AN
OVERALL POLITICAL PERSPECTIVE. CHIANG CHING-KUO IS NOW

OF A UNITED FRONT IN THE LONG RUN IS INFEASIBLE. BUT IN HIS

ALWAYS BEEN SO.
SENATOR HART: DURING MY VISIT WITH SENATOR CRANSTON
YOU SPOKE A GREAT DEAL OF THE SOVIE T THREAT TO
SOUTHEAST ASIA AND TO CHINA. WE AE AWARE THAT
AMONG YOUR DUTIES YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR CHINESE
SECURITY. DO YOU THINK THE SOVIET NAVY IS A
GREATER THREAT NOW TO CHINA AND OTHER NATIONS IN
THE AREA?
DENG: I REMEMBER ON THAT OCCASION I SAID THAT
SOVIET FORCES IN EAST ASIA WERE NOT ONLY DIRECTED
AT CHINA BUT PRIMARILY AT THE SEVENTH FLEET. OF
COURSE THEIR TROOPS ARE ALSO DIRECTED TOWARD
CHINA AND JAPAN. NOW PARTICILARLY WITH REGARD TO
THE BUILDUP OF AIR AND NAVAL FORCE IN THE FAR
EAST,T THE SOVIETS HAVE NO NEED TO CONTROL CHINA. I
SAID BEFORE SPECIFICALLY THAT CHINA DOES NOT FEAR
SOVIET TROOPS. THE FOCUS OF THE SOVIET THREAT IS
IN EUROPE, INCLUDING THE MIDDLE EAST, THE MEDITERRANEAN
AND EVEN IRAN AND AFRICA. THE FOCUS IS IN THE WEST.
WE HAVE NO REASON TO CHANGE OUR POINT OF VIEW. HOWEVER, NEW DEVELOPMENTS MERIT OUR ATTENTION. THE

STRENGTH OF FORCES IN THE SOVIET AREA WAS THE
ACHIEVEMENT OF SUCCESS INAFGHANISTAN AND VIETNAM.
VIETNAM AS USED BY THE SOVIET UNION HAS PLAYED A
GREAT ROLE. SO HAS CUBA IN THE MIDDLE EAST AND
AFRICA. SO PEOPLE SAY THAT THE PACIFIC OCEAN IS
EVEN LESS PACIFIC THAN BEFORE.
AS FAR AS CHINA IS CONCERNED, FRANKLY, WE
ARE NOT AFRAID. IF THE SOVIET UNION WERE TO ATTACK
US, A MILLION TROOPS WOULD NOT BE ENOUGH. THE SINOSOVIET BOUNDARY IS SEVEN THOUSAND KILOMETERS LONG.
THE SOVIETS COULD ENGAGE US IN SMALL ACTIONS,
BUT FOR MASSIVE ATTACK A MILLION SOLDIERS WOULD
NOT BE ENOUGH. EVEN IF THE SOVIET UNION WOULD ATTACK,
THEY WOULD HAVE TO THINK ABOUT THE REACTION FROM
JAPAN, THE US AND EUROPE.
JUST WITH REGARD TO CHINA, THEY COULD OCCUPY
PEKING BUT IT WOLD ONLY BE THE START OF THE WAR.
WITH REGARDS TO DEVELOPMENTS IN SOUTHEAST ASIA
AND THE ATTACK ON KAMPUCHEA BY VIETNAM, WE ARE NOT
ONLY THINKING ABOUT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN
CHINA AND RUSSIA BUT GLOBALLY. ASEAN IS NOW
EXPOSEDAT THE FRONT. THE US AND JAPAN SHOULD LOOK ON
THIS FROM A GLOBAL PERSPECTIVE.
HART: DOES CHINA OPPOSE AN INCREASE IN ASEAN
SECURITY ARRANGEMENTS? DOES CHINA OPPOSE AN
INCREASE IN US NAVAL FORCES IN THE AREA?

WE HAVE ALWAYS ASSISTED THE GOVERNMENT OF KAMPUCHEA
HEADED BY POL POT. WE HAVE ALWAYS OPPOSED
VIETNAMESE AGGRESSION. WE HAVE ALSO NOTICED THAT
THE UNITED STATES HAS A POSITION AGAINST FOREIGN
AGGRESSION. THE LOSS OF PHNOM PENH AND OTHER IMPORTANT PLACES DOES NOT MEAN THE END OF THE WAR. WE HAVE

DURING THE ANTI-JAPANESE WAR WE JUST HELD A FEW

IS ALWAYS THE SAME. JUST AS ALWAYS. THE RUSSIANS
WILL NOT BE RESTRICTED BY ANY AGREEMENT. WE DO
NOT BLOW OUR OWN TRUMPET BUT PERHAPS THE ESTABLISHMENT OF SINO-AMERICAN RELATIONS IS A GOOD WAY
TO CONTAIN THE SOVIET UNION. A CLOSER PARTNERSHIP
BETWEEN EUROPE AND THE UNITED STATES IS ALWAYS A
GOOD WAY TO CONTAIN THE SOVIET UNION AS IS A
STRENGTHENED RELATIONSHIP WITH JAPAN. AS WAS SAID
WHEN DR. KISSINGER AND PRESIDENT FORD MET WITH

CLEAR IN UNDERSTANDING THAT VICE PREMIER DENG
SAID FULL AUTONOMY WHICH MIGHT LAST FOR A CENTURY.
DENG: NOT RAISE, TAKE DOWN (I.E., TAKE DOWN THE ROC

NUNN: ONE OF OUR AREAS OF CONCERN IS THE SITUATION IN KOREA.
OUR TWO COUNTRIES HAVE MADE GREAT PROGRESS IN NORMALIZING
OUR RELATIONS. IT WOULD BE TRAGIC IF AN OUTBREAK IN KOREA
WERE TO TAKE PLACE. I KNOW THAT YOU TOO ARE CONCERNED. OUR
INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY HAS TOLD US THAT THERE ARE MORE POWERFUL
FORCES IN THE NORTH THAN WE HAD PREVIOUSLY THOUGHT. IF THE
UNITED STATES WERE TO TALK TO SOUTH KOREA AND CHINA TO NORTH
KOREA, OUR COOPERATION COULD REDUCE TENSION AND PERHAPS
BRING ABOUT DIRECT TALKS BETWEEN THE TWO.
DENG: IN THE PAST OTHER US FRIENDS HAVE BROUGHT UP THIS
QUESTION. DURING MY TRIP TO JAPAN, JAPANESE LEADERS POSED
THE SAME QUESTION TO ME. IN POSING SUCH QUESTIONS, PEOPLE
EXPRESSED APPREHENSION OF POSSIBLE MILITARY ACTIVITIES ON
THE PART OF NORTH KOREA. THE JAPANESE WERE APPREHENSIVE
AND SPOKE TO ME OF A VERY TENSE SITUATION IN KOREA. ON THAT
OCCASION WE WERE TOLD BY JAPANESE LEADERS THAT JAPAN HAD THE
SAME IMPRESSION OF THE EXISTENCE OF TENSIONS IN KOREA. THERE
IS NO QUESTION OF THE DPRK WAGING AN OFFENSIVE. WE SAID
THEN THAT WE ARE AWARE OF THE FOLLOWING FACTS. WE FAITH
IN WHAT KIM IL SONG HAS SAID ABOUT PEACEFUL REUNIFICATION

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014

AND WE HAVE RENDERED OUR CONSISTENT SUPPORT TO THAT POLICY.
I SAY TO OUR AMERICAN AND JAPANESE FRIENDS WHAT DESERVES
ATTENTION IS THAT PEACEFUL AND INDEPENDENT REUNIFICATION
AS SPOKEN OF IN NORTH KOREAN POLICY MEANS REUNIFICATION
IN A PEACEFUL MANNER. WE UNDERSTAND THAT THOROUGHLY. IN
MY VIEW, THERE IS SOME INFORMATION THAT IS NOT CORRECT IN
THIS REGARD. WE ARE ON GOOD TERMS WITH THE DPRK AND WE UNDERSTAND THEIR SITUATION. YOU SHOULD UNDERSTAND THE FOLLOWING
FACTS. IN THE PAST PRESIDENT KIM IL SONG AND NORTH KOREA
SOUGHT TO HOLD DIRECT TALKS WITH THE SOUTH KOREAN AUTHORITIES.
LATER ON THE SOUTH KOREAN AUTHORITIES SUSPENDED THOSE TALKS.
WE ARE ALSO AWARE OF THE FACT THAT KIM WANTS VERY MUCH TO
RESUME TALKS WITH KOREA. WHILE WE DESIRE THAT NEGOTIATIONS
RESUME, WE ALSO EXPRESS THE HOPE THAT SINCE SOUTH KOREA

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
I WONDER IF THE UNITED STATES WILL HELP BRING ABOUT DIRECT
TALKS. THERE IS NO QUESTION THAT NORTH KOREA DESIRES THEIR
RESUMPTION.
NUNN: WE WOULD WELCOME SUCH A DEVELOPMENT. BUT THE INCLUSION
OF OPPONENTS OF THE PRESENT GOVERNMENT IN SOUTH KOREA SEEMS
UNREALISTIC AND SEEMS TO BE TANTAMOUNT TO THE NORTH SAYING
THAT THEY DON'T WANT DIRECT DISCUSSIONS. I DO BELIEVE THAT
CHINA AND NORTH KOREA, THE UNITED STATES AND SOUTH KOREA
HAVE A CONSIDERABLE AREA TO WORK IN. VIOLENCE IN THIS REGION
WOULD BE A BLOW TO BOTH OF OUR INTERESTS. OUR RELATIONSHIP
SHOULD NOT BE SUBJECT TO SUCH RISKS.
DENG: I WOULD LIKE TO REPEAT MY POINT. WE DON'T FEEL SUCH
TENSION IN THE SITUATION. AS FAR AS CHINA IS CONCERNED,
YEARS AGO THE UNITED STATES MADE SUCH A PROPOSAL. CHINA HAS
CONFIDENTIAL

PAGE 02

PEKING 00162 02 OF 05 110836Z

NO DIRECT RESPONSIBILITY IN THIS AREA. THE UNITED STATES
HAS; THE UNITED STATES HAS TROOPS THERE. THE U.S. SHOULD
ENTER INTO A DIRECT DIALOGUE. THROUGH A DIRECT DIALOGUE THE
TWO SIDES CAN GET A DEEPER KNOWLEDGE OF EACH OTHER.
ANYWAY WE HOPE THAT THIS MATTER SHOULD NOT INVOLVE
THE FOUR PARTIES. WE HAVE NO TROUBLES IN KOREA. WHEN I WAS
IN JAPAN, THE JAPANESE SUGGESTED THAT CHINA SHOULD WORK
WITH NORTH KOREA AND JAPAN WITH SOUTH KOREA.
WE SAID THIS WAS UNREALISTIC. ASAID TO THE JAPANESE
LEADERS IN EXPLICIT TERMS THAT CHINA AND NORTH KOREA HAVE
A GOOD RELATIONSHIP BECAUSE WE DO NOT INTERFERE IN NORTH
KOREAN AFFAIRS. WHAT WE CAN DO IS TO CONVEY THE NORTH KOREAN
POSITION TO YOU. I HOPE YOU WILL CONVEY NORTH KOREAN IDEAS
TO THE SOUTH KOREAN AUTHORITIES. WE THINK THIS APPROACH
HAS MERIT.
NUNN: WE HOPE THE TWO SIDES CAN TALK DIRECTLY. CHINA HAS
MUCH INFLUENCE IN THE AREA. IN ANY CASE, WE HOPE THAT BOTH
SIDES CAN PEACEFULLY RESOLVE THE PROBLEM.
DENG: I SAY TO YOU FROM DEEP IN MY HEART THAT OVERT INTERFERENCE IN A NATION'S AFFAIRS CAN ONLY ACHIEVE THE OPPOSITE OF
WHAT IS INTENDED. CHINA AND NORTH KOREA ENJOY GOOD RELATIONS
BECAUSE WE FULLY RESPECT THEM AND DO NOT INTERFERE IN THEIR
AFFAIRS. I CAN TELL YOU SOMETHING WHICH HAS NOT BEEN PUBLICIZED: THE REASON NORTH KOREAN AND SOVIET RELATIONS ARE BAD
IS BECAUSE THE SOVIETS INTERFERED IN NORTH KOREAN AFFAIRS.
THE SOVIET UNION HAS TRIED TO USE ITS AID TO NORTH KOREA
TO ASSERT INFLUENCE AND CONTROL AND THAT IS WHY RELATIONS
ARE BAD. ANOTHER POINT: OUR POSITION WOULD BE BETTER IF
US TROOPS DISENGAGED FROM SOUTH KOREA. WHEN I WAS IN JAPAN,
JAPANESE LEADERS ASKED ME IF IN SO DOING, US STRENGTH IN

THAT TO MOVE US TROOPS SEVERAL HUNDRED KILOMETERS WOULD
NOT WEAKEN STRENGTH IN THE REGION. OTHERS QUESTIONED WHETHER
THE WITHDRAWAL WOULD LEAD TO A NORTH KOREAN OFFENSIVE. I
SAY THAT THE MILITARY STRENGTH OF SOUTH KOREA IS NO LOWER
THAN THAT OF NORTH KOREA.
SENATOR GLENN: I WOULD LIKE TO CONGRATULATE YOU ON THE
INITIATIVE TAKEN TO RESTORE RELATIONS BETWEEN OUR COUNTRIES.
I WOULD LIKE TO EXPLORE A DIFFERENCE AREA. FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS
OFTEN DO NOT UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE OF THE CONGRESSIONAL
INPUT INTO OUR CONDUCT OF FOREIGN RELATIONS. AS WE MOVE
INTO AGREEMENTS TO MAKE NORMALIZATORK ON SUCH MATTERS
AS CLAIMS AND ASSETS, LOANS, OUR FUTURE FINANCIAL RELATIONS,
ALL OF THESE MUST BE APPROVED BY CONGRESS. DIFFICULTIES
IN THIS AREA COULD UPSET AND RUIN THE NEW RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN
THE TWO COUNTRIES. CONGRESS IS SENSITIVE TO THE MOOD OF
THE PEOPLE. WE HAVE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE WHO ARE STILL CONCERNED
ABOUT THE SECURITY IN TAIWAN. I HAVE FOLLOWED CLOSELY THE
STATEMENTS THAT THE VICE PREMIER HAS MADE AND HAVE BEEN
GRATIFIED AND HAPPY TO HEAR WHAT HE HAS HAD TO SAY ABOUT
THE USE OF PEACEFUL MEANS. IF WE ARE TO REALIZE THE GOOD
THINGS THAT SHOULD FLOW FROM NORMALIZATION THEN THE PEOPLE
OF THE UNITED STATES MUST GET BEHIND THE NORMALIZATION PROCESS.
WHEN VICE PREMIER TENG VISITS THE UNITED STATES THE AMERICAN
PEOPLE WILL BE MORE IMPRESSED THAN ANYTHING ELSE BY STATEMENTS
ON PEACEFUL REUNIFICATION. THIS WILL DO MORE TO GET PUBLIC
OPINION BEHIND MOST FAVORED NATION STATUS, A CLAIMS AND
ASSETS SETTLEMENT, AND FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS THAT WILL BE
MOST BENEFICIAL TO THE TWO COUNTRIES.
DENG: OUR POSITION ON THIS QUESTION IS CLEAR-CUT. AMBASSADOR
WOODCOCK, I THINK, IS MOST WELL INFORMED ABOUT OUR POSITION.
WE HAVE COVERED THIS QUESTION WITH MANY US DELEGATIONS. AS
FAR AS CHINA IS CONCERNED, OF COURSE, WE HOPE TO USE AND
ARE PURSUING A PROCESS OF PEACEFUL REUNIFICATION AND A RETURN
TO THE MOTHERLAND OF TAIWAN. HOWEVER, WE HAVE ALWAYS ADHERED

CINCPAC FOR POLAD
TO THE POINT THAT HOW THIS REUNIFICATION IS ACCOMPLISHED
IS AN INTERNAL CHINESE QUESTION. THE REASON WE CANNOT UNILATERALLY SAY THAT WE ARE NOT GOING TO USE FORCE TO SETTLE
THE QUESTION OF TAIWAN IS BECAUSE IF WE SHOULD UNDERTAKE
SUCH A COMMITMENT THEN THE QUESTION COULD NOT BE SETTLED
IN A PEACEFUL MANNER, BECAUSE SUCH A COMMITMENT WOULD BE
EQUIVALENT TO BINDING CHINESE HANDS. I TOLD THE AMERICAN
CORRESPONDENTS THAT WE CAN'T TIE OUR OWN HANDS. THE REASON
IS THAT IF WE DO, THEN TAIWAN AUTHORITIES LED BY CHIANG
CHING-KUO WOULD BECOME RECKLESS AND SUCH ACTION WOULD LEAD
TO THE CONSEQUENCE THAT TAIWAN WOULD ENTER INTO NO TALKS
AT ALL. WHAT WILL THE CONSEQUENCE BE IF WE SAY WE WILL NOT
USE FORCE AND ONE OR TWO YEARS GO BY WITHOUT TALKS, AND
THAT IS ALL RIGHT, BUT AFTER TEN YEARS? WHAT HAPPENS? IF
CHINA JUST HAS ONE HAND THIS WILL LEAD TO A SETTLEMENT BY
ARMED FORCE.
LET ALL OF US ANALYZE THE PROBLEM IN PERSPECTIVE. THERE
ARE ONLY TWO CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE FORCE WOULD BE USED. THE
CONFIDENTIAL

PEKING 00162 03 OF 05 110756Z

FIRST CIRCUMSTANCE, IF IN TAKING ADVANTAGE OF CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES IN THE WORLD, TAIWAN ABSOLUTELY REFUSES TO ENTER
INTO TALKS WITH US. THAT IS, WE HAVE ADOPTED A REALISTIC
APPROACH TOWARDS THE QUESTION OF TAIWAN AFTER REUNIFICATION.

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
THIS REALISTIC APPROACH INCLUDES THE ABILITY OF TAIWAN TO
MAINTAIN A PEOPLE-TO-PEOPLE RELATIONSHIP WITH JAPAN AND
THE UNITED ST THERE WOULD BE NO CHANGE IN SOCIAL CONDITIONS.
THE PEOPLE'S LIVING STANDARD WOULD IMPROVE. IF WE PERMIT
ALL THIS AND THE TAIWAN AUTHORITIES STILL DO NOT WANT TO
TALK, WHAT IS TO BE DONE? THE SECOND CIRCUMSTANCE WOULD BE
AS FOLLOWS: DURING THE COURSE OF NEGOTIATIONS SOME PEOPLE
POINTED OUT THE POSSIBILITY OF THE SOVIETS GETTING INTO
TAIWAN AFTER NORMALIZATION. OUR US FRIENDS ON SEVERAL DELEGATIONS POSED THE SAME QUESTION. WE SEE NO SUCH THREAT.
CHIANG WOULD FIND IT VERY DIFFICULT TO CONTEMPLATE GOOD
RELATIONS WITH THE SOVIET UNION.
WHILE ON THAT SUBJECT, BESIDES THE PURELY CHINESE ASPECT,
THE US WOULD STILL HAVE PEOPLE-TO-PEOPLE CONTACTS AND WOULD
STILL HAVE A LARGE ECONOMIC RELATIONSHIP. JAPAN WOULD ALSO
SUFFER IF CHIANG CHING-KUO WERE TO EMBARK ON SUCH A COURSE.
AND THEN, I COUNTER THE QUESTION TO MANY US FRIENDS, SUPPOSE
THE SOVIET UNION WERE TO OCCUPY TAIWAN. THEN I ASSUME THE
US WOULD NOT OPPOSE CHINA USING FORCE. THAT IS WHY WE CANNOT
BIND OUR HANDS. YOU MUST HAVE NOTICED OUR MESSAGE TO OUR
FRIENDS ON TAIWAN. THE TONE OF OUR MESSAGE IS ALWAYS REASONABLE.
I HOPE I HAVE EXPLAINED MY VIEWS CLEARLY.
NUNN: I COMMEND THE WAY YOU HAVE HANDLED THIS QUSETION. I
THINK YOU HAVE IMPRESSED THE AMERICAN PEOPLE OF YOUR PEACEFUL
INTENTIONS. AFTER REUNIFICATION COULD IT BE POSSIBLE FOR
TAIWAN TO MAINTAIN SECURITY FORCES?
TENG: THERE WILL BE NO DIFFICULTY. THERE WILL BE NO CHANGE

PEKING 00162 03 OF 05 110756Z

IN THE SOCIAL SOCIETY OR IN THE WAY OF LIFE, AND THE TAIWAN
AUTHORITIES WILL POSSESS THE SAME POWER THEY POSSESS NOW.
THE ONLY THING THEY HAVE TO DO IS DROP THE ROC FLAG. TAIWAN
IS PART OF CHINESE TERRITORY. WE EXTEND A WELCOME TO THEM
TO ENJOY FULL AUTONOMY. AFTERWARDS, WITH THE DEVELOPMENT
OF THE CHINESE ECONOMY AND THE INCREASE OF CONTACTS BETWEEN
THE TWO SIDES (THERE WILL BE A CLOSER RELATIONSHIP).
NUNN: THEN WE ARE TO UNDERSTAND THATQUESTION OF SECURITY
FORCES COULD BE WORKED OUT OVER TIME. THE TAIWAN AUTHORITIES
COULD MAINTAIN SECURITY FORCES OVER A PERIOD OF TIME WITHOUT
BEING DISARMED?
DENG: NO, THERE IS NO NEED.
NUNN: THAT SHOULD BE A HELP IN INITIATING MEANINGFUL DISCUSSIONS.
DENG: EVEN IF WE ADOPT SUCH A POSTURE IT WILL NOT BE SO

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
EASY. IN MY VIEW THE US SIDE CAN HELP. WE THINK OUR DEMANDS
ARE RATIONAL. CHAIRMAN MAO AND ZHOU ENLAI (CHOU EN-LAI) HAD
THE SAME CONCEPT THAT WE HAVE JUST MENTIONED.
TIBET IS A CASE IN POINT. BEFORE THE DALAI LAMA BETRAYED
US, WE SAID WE WOULD NOT CARRY OUT REVISIONS IN TIBET. THAT
MEANT THAT THE DALAI LAMA COULD MAINTAIN THE SLAVE SYSTEM.
WE DID NOT INSTITUTE DEMOCRATIC REFORMS FOR TEN YEARS. IT
WAS NOT CARRIED OUT UNTIL THE DALAI LAMA LEFT. IF HE WANTS
TO COME BACK NOW HE IS WELCOME.
ANOTHER EXAMPLE: YOU KNOW ABOUT THE QUESTION OF HONG
KONG AND MACAO. CHINA ALWAYS CONSIDERS SUCH QUESTIONS FROM
AN OVERALL POLITICAL PERSPECTIVE. THE REASON WHY WE SAY
WE NEED TWO HANDS IS THAT WE APPROACH THE QUESTION FROM AN
OVERALL POLITICAL PERSPECTIVE. CHIANG CHING-KUO IS NOW
SAYING THAT THE WAY CHINA PLANS TO GO ABOUT THE QUESTION
OF A UNITED FRONT IN THE LONG RUN IS INFEASIBLE. BUT IN HIS

GLENN: TAIWAN IS NOT QUITE THE SAME AS TIBET AND
THE OTHER EXAMPLES. WHILE THE VICE PREMIER HAS
SHOWN ADMIRABLE PATIENCE IN THE INTENTIONS TO
MAKE CHANGES OVER A LONG PERIOD, THERE IS A CONSIDERABLE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE FREE ENTERPRISE
SYSTEM AND THE COMMUNIST SYSTEM.

DENG: IT IS A PROBLEM FOR THE FUTURE. IT IS A
NATURAL PROCESS WITH LONG-TERM CONSEQUENCES. IF
THE PEOPLE DECIED FOR A CERTAIN SYSTEM, THEN
THAT SYSTEM SHOULD BE USED. IF MORE THAN TEN
MILLION PEOPLE THINK SO, THEN THE EXISTING SYSTEM
SHOULD CONTINUE EVEN FOR ONE CENTURY.

WILL D MUCH TO ALLAY THOSE FEARS.
DENG: IT IS NOT MERELY OUR IDEA TODAY, BUT IT HAS
ALWAYS BEEN SO.
SENATOR HART: DURING MY VISIT WITH SENATOR CRANSTON
YOU SPOKE A GREAT DEAL OF THE SOVIE T THREAT TO
SOUTHEAST ASIA AND TO CHINA. WE AE AWARE THAT
AMONG YOUR DUTIES YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR CHINESE
SECURITY. DO YOU THINK THE SOVIET NAVY IS A
GREATER THREAT NOW TO CHINA AND OTHER NATIONS IN
THE AREA?
DENG: I REMEMBER ON THAT OCCASION I SAID THAT
SOVIET FORCES IN EAST ASIA WERE NOT ONLY DIRECTED
AT CHINA BUT PRIMARILY AT THE SEVENTH FLEET. OF
COURSE THEIR TROOPS ARE ALSO DIRECTED TOWARD
CHINA AND JAPAN. NOW PARTICILARLY WITH REGARD TO
THE BUILDUP OF AIR AND NAVAL FORCE IN THE FAR
EAST,T THE SOVIETS HAVE NO NEED TO CONTROL CHINA. I
SAID BEFORE SPECIFICALLY THAT CHINA DOES NOT FEAR
SOVIET TROOPS. THE FOCUS OF THE SOVIET THREAT IS
IN EUROPE, INCLUDING THE MIDDLE EAST, THE MEDITERRANEAN
AND EVEN IRAN AND AFRICA. THE FOCUS IS IN THE WEST.
WE HAVE NO REASON TO CHANGE OUR POINT OF VIEW. HOWEVER, NEW DEVELOPMENTS MERIT OUR ATTENTION. THE
SOVIET UNION HAS BUILT UP ITS FORCES IN EAST ASIA
AND THE PACIFIC. THE DEVELOPMENT WHICH SPURRED THE

STRENGTH OF FORCES IN THE SOVIET AREA WAS THE
ACHIEVEMENT OF SUCCESS INAFGHANISTAN AND VIETNAM.
VIETNAM AS USED BY THE SOVIET UNION HAS PLAYED A
GREAT ROLE. SO HAS CUBA IN THE MIDDLE EAST AND
AFRICA. SO PEOPLE SAY THAT THE PACIFIC OCEAN IS
EVEN LESS PACIFIC THAN BEFORE.
AS FAR AS CHINA IS CONCERNED, FRANKLY, WE
ARE NOT AFRAID. IF THE SOVIET UNION WERE TO ATTACK
US, A MILLION TROOPS WOULD NOT BE ENOUGH. THE SINOSOVIET BOUNDARY IS SEVEN THOUSAND KILOMETERS LONG.
THE SOVIETS COULD ENGAGE US IN SMALL ACTIONS,
BUT FOR MASSIVE ATTACK A MILLION SOLDIERS WOULD
NOT BE ENOUGH. EVEN IF THE SOVIET UNION WOULD ATTACK,
THEY WOULD HAVE TO THINK ABOUT THE REACTION FROM
JAPAN, THE US AND EUROPE.
JUST WITH REGARD TO CHINA, THEY COULD OCCUPY
PEKING BUT IT WOLD ONLY BE THE START OF THE WAR.
WITH REGARDS TO DEVELOPMENTS IN SOUTHEAST ASIA
AND THE ATTACK ON KAMPUCHEA BY VIETNAM, WE ARE NOT
ONLY THINKING ABOUT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN
CHINA AND RUSSIA BUT GLOBALLY. ASEAN IS NOW
EXPOSEDAT THE FRONT. THE US AND JAPAN SHOULD LOOK ON
THIS FROM A GLOBAL PERSPECTIVE.
HART: DOES CHINA OPPOSE AN INCREASE IN ASEAN
SECURITY ARRANGEMENTS? DOES CHINA OPPOSE AN
INCREASE IN US NAVAL FORCES IN THE AREA?
DENG: VERY GOOD (PRESUMABLY MEANING HE FAVORED
AN INCREASE IN BOTH).

DENG: THERE ARE AMPLE WAYS. WE WILL CONTINUE TO
RENDER ASSISTANCE AS LONG AS IT IS IN OUR CAPABILITY.
WE HAVE ALWAYS ASSISTED THE GOVERNMENT OF KAMPUCHEA
HEADED BY POL POT. WE HAVE ALWAYS OPPOSED
VIETNAMESE AGGRESSION. WE HAVE ALSO NOTICED THAT
THE UNITED STATES HAS A POSITION AGAINST FOREIGN
AGGRESSION. THE LOSS OF PHNOM PENH AND OTHER IMPORTANT PLACES DOES NOT MEAN THE END OF THE WAR. WE HAVE
OUR OWN EXPERIENCE.
DURING THE ANTI-JAPANESE WAR WE JUST HELD A FEW
COUNTY SEATS; WE ONCE EVEN LOST YENAN. WE KNOW
THE SITUATION WELL. THE LOSS OF CITIES DID NOT
MEAN THE END OF THE WAR.

TECHNOLOGY. WITHOUT THE FIRST THREE THE MODERNIZATION OF NATIONAL DEFENSE HAS NO BASE TO STAND ON.
IN NATIONAL DEFENSE WE ALSO ARE INTRODCUCING SOPHISTICATED FOREIGN MATERIAL INTOCHINA BUT OUR FUNDS
ARE GOING MOSTLY TO INDUSTRY, AGRICULTURE AND SCIENCE

IS ALWAYS THE SAME. JUST AS ALWAYS. THE RUSSIANS
WILL NOT BE RESTRICTED BY ANY AGREEMENT. WE DO
NOT BLOW OUR OWN TRUMPET BUT PERHAPS THE ESTABLISHMENT OF SINO-AMERICAN RELATIONS IS A GOOD WAY
TO CONTAIN THE SOVIET UNION. A CLOSER PARTNERSHIP
BETWEEN EUROPE AND THE UNITED STATES IS ALWAYS A
GOOD WAY TO CONTAIN THE SOVIET UNION AS IS A
STRENGTHENED RELATIONSHIP WITH JAPAN. AS WAS SAID
WHEN DR. KISSINGER AND PRESIDENT FORD MET WITH

THE BASTARDS.&quot;

FULL AUTONOMY FOR TAIWAN ARE MOST IMPORTANT. AM
CLEAR IN UNDERSTANDING THAT VICE PREMIER DENG
SAID FULL AUTONOMY WHICH MIGHT LAST FOR A CENTURY.
DENG: NOT RAISE, TAKE DOWN (I.E., TAKE DOWN THE ROC
FLAG). THERE IS NOT A QUAEION OF RAISING THE FLAG.
