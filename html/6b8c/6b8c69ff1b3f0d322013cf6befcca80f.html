		<h3>Tor</h3>
		<p><a href="https://www.torproject.org">Tor</a> is an encrypted anonymising network that makes it harder to intercept internet communications, or see where communications are coming from or going to.</p>
		<p>In order to use the WikiLeaks public submission system as detailed above you can download the Tor Browser Bundle, which is a Firefox-like browser available for Windows, Mac OS X and GNU/Linux and pre-configured to connect using the anonymising system Tor.</p>
		<h4>Tails</h4>
		<p>If you are at high risk and you have the capacity to do so, you can also access the submission system through a secure operating system called <a href="https://tails.boum.org">Tails</a>. Tails is an operating system launched from a USB stick or a DVD that aim to leaves no traces when the computer is shut down after use and automatically routes your internet traffic through Tor. Tails will require you to have either a USB stick or a DVD at least 4GB big and a laptop or desktop computer.</p>

		<h3>Tips</h3>
		<p>Our submission system works hard to preserve your anonymity, but we recommend you also take some of your own precautions. Please review these basic guidelines. </p>
		<div>
			<h4>1. Contact us if you have specific problems</h4>
			<p>If you have a very large submission, or a submission with a complex format, or are a high-risk source, please <a href="#submit_help_contact">contact us</a>. In our experience it is always possible to find a custom solution for even the most seemingly difficult situations.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h4>2. What computer to use</h4>
			<p>If the computer you are uploading from could subsequently be audited in an investigation, consider using a computer that is not easily tied to you. Technical users can also use <a href="https://tails.boum.org">Tails</a> to help ensure you do not leave any records of your submission on the computer.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h4>3. Do not talk about your submission to others</h4>
			<p>If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in source protection – it is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This includes other media organisations.</p>
		</div>

	</div>
</div>

<div id="submit_help_after" class="submit_elem">

			</div>
		</div>

		<h3>After</h3>

		<div>
			<h4>1. Do not talk about your submission to others</h4>
			<p>If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in source protection – it is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This includes other media organisations.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h4>2. Act normal</h4>
			<p>If you are a high-risk source, avoid saying anything or doing anything after submitting which might promote suspicion. In particular, you should try to stick to your normal routine and behaviour.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h4>3. Remove traces of your submission</h4>
			<p>If you are a high-risk source and the computer you prepared your submission on, or uploaded it from, could subsequently be audited in an investigation, we recommend that you format and dispose of the computer hard drive and any other storage media you used.</p>
			<p>In particular, hard drives retain data after formatting which may be visible to a digital forensics team and flash media (USB sticks, memory cards and SSD drives) retain data even after a secure erasure. If you used flash media to store sensitive data, it is important to destroy the media.</p>
			<p>If you do this and are a high-risk source you should make sure there are no traces of the clean-up, since such traces themselves may draw suspicion.</p>
			<div>
				<h4>4. If you face legal action</h4>
				<p>If a legal action is brought against you as a result of your submission, there are organisations that may help you. The Courage Foundation is an international organisation dedicated to the protection of journalistic sources. You can find more details at <a href="https://www.couragefound.org">https://www.couragefound.org</a>.</p>

		<p>WikiLeaks publishes documents of political or historical importance that are censored or otherwise suppressed. We specialise in strategic global publishing and large archives.</p>
		<p>The following is the address of our secure site where you can anonymously upload your documents to WikiLeaks editors. You can only access this submissions system through Tor. (See our <a href="#submit_help_tor">Tor tab</a> for more information.) We also advise you to read our <a href="#submit_help_tips">tips for sources</a> before submitting.</p>

   <p>On Monday February 27th, 2012, WikiLeaks began publishing <i>The Global Intelligence Files</i>, over five million e-mails from the Texas headquartered  "global intelligence" company Stratfor. The e-mails date between July  2004 and late December 2011. They reveal the inner workings of a company  that fronts as an intelligence publisher, but provides confidential  intelligence services to large corporations, such as Bhopal's Dow  Chemical Co., Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, Raytheon and government  agencies, including the US Department of Homeland Security, the US  Marines and the US Defence Intelligence Agency. The emails show  Stratfor's web of informers, pay-off structure, payment laundering techniques and psychological methods.</p>

    Summary                                                                   <br />

    In public, the Chinese government has sought to present a fairly          <br />
    confident picture of the countrya**s capabilities and response to the     <br />
    global financial crisis. But the internal assessment is very different,   <br />
    and the problem is not limited to the impact of a global financial        <br />
    slowdown.                                                                 <br />

      * Chinaa**s Economic Imbalance                                          <br />
                                                                              <br />
    Chinese leaders and media recently have been proffering relatively        <br />
    upbeat assessments of Beijinga**s ability to cope with the global         <br />
    financial crisis, suggesting that China not only can weather the crisis,  <br />
    but can perhaps even come out in a stronger global position. Beijing has  <br />
    been particularly eager to emphasize its 4 trillion yuan (US$585          <br />
    billion) a**stimulusa** package a** pledged not just as a boost for the   <br />
    Chinese economy, but also as a contributing factor to a global recovery.  <br />
                                                                              <br />
    But behind the optimistic facade, there are much deeper worries in        <br />
    Beijing. There are concerns about the Chinese economy as well as about    <br />
    the governmenta**s ability to handle problems at home given the           <br />
    international economic slowdown. Chinese economists recognize that the    <br />
    global financial crisis is not the direct cause of Beijinga**s woes, but  <br />
    simply a compounding factor, exacerbating an already-existing and         <br />
    increasingly apparent domestic crisis. What the crisis has done,          <br />
    however, is bring Chinaa**s problems squarely into the light.             <br />
                                                                              <br />
    Beijing had long managed the situation through a combination of           <br />
    continued support of the export-driven industries (or at least minimal    <br />
    controls on them) and supplementation of domestic demand via large        <br />
    infrastructure projects (the Tibet railway and the West-East natural gas  <br />
    pipelines being recent examples). In short, China relies on continued     <br />
    inflows of money from exports and investments to support its own          <br />
    domestic spending on its interior provinces. However, Beijing also has    <br />
    relied on a relatively stable or rising global economy to enable it to    <br />
    carry out the deeper reforms needed to strengthen its domestic economy,   <br />
    without also ripping the fabric of Chinese society. But with global       <br />
    economic stability slipping, Chinaa**s economic buffer is fast            <br />
    disappearing a** raising fears that a long-delayed reckoning can no       <br />
    longer be pushed back.                                                    <br />
                                                                              <br />
     The Chinese Economy and the Threat of Unrest                             <br />
                                                                              <br />
    For Beijing, these efforts, and the recognition that the Chinese          <br />
    economic model is not sustainable, trace back much further than the       <br />
    current crisis.                                                           <br />
                                                                              <br />
    In the 1990s, as the Chinese economy recovered from the temporary         <br />
    international political setbacks triggered by the 1989 Tiananmen Square   <br />
    incident, Beijing happily continued down the path of the Asian tigers,    <br />
    promoting high rates of growth through economic programs that were        <br />
    resource-intensive, based around strong export growth, and heavily        <br />
    dependent on continued foreign investment.                                <br />
                                                                              <br />
    When the inevitable crisis struck East Asia in 1997 and 1998 a**          <br />
    something that should have been foreseen after Japana**s descent into     <br />
    malaise a few years earlier a** China was not immune. Its gross domestic  <br />
    product (GDP) growth rate fell as low as 6.8 percent for the second       <br />
    quarter of 1998, compared to 9.5 percent in the second quarter of 1997.   <br />
    This was a far cry from the double-digit negative growth rates seen in    <br />
    some Southeast Asian countries at the same time, and in many ways China   <br />
    appeared to dodge the bullet of the 1997 meltdown.                        <br />
                                                                              <br />
    Chart: Chinese GDP Growth                                                 <br />
                                                                              <br />
    But Chinese policymakers still heard alarm bells going off. They          <br />
    believed at the time that anything below 7 percent growth would not       <br />
    provide enough jobs to soak up the new workers joining the workforce,     <br />
    and they were afraid that rising unemployment could destabilize the       <br />
    country politically. Given the deep economic divisions between Chinaa**s  <br />
    wealthy coastal regions and its less-developed interior, Beijing has a    <br />
    deeply ingrained fear of anything (such as high unemployment) that        <br />
    increases social unrest, and thus Chinese economic policy is designed     <br />
    primarily with social stability in mind. It has not been all that many    <br />
    decades since these economic disparities brought the Chinese Communist    <br />
    Party to power, and Beijing is well aware that the same disparities       <br />
    could unseat the Party if they are not well-managed.                      <br />
                                                                              <br />
    This fear sent the government scrambling. The recognition that the Asian  <br />
    model a** cheap capital and high export-driven growth a** wasna**t all    <br />
    it was cracked up to be led to a reformation of Chinese thinking, at      <br />
    least in spirit. Beijing took a bipolar approach to the imminent crisis,  <br />
    seeking to address the short-term social crisis by ramping up exports     <br />
    just to keep funds flowing, while also trying to rectify the long-term    <br />
    contradictions in the Chinese economic model.                             <br />
                                                                              <br />
    When the Partya**s Central Economic Committee met in December 1998, it    <br />
    announced an ambitious refocusing of the Chinese economic model. The new  <br />
    approach would emphasize profitability and sustainability of growth,      <br />
    rather than growth for its own sake. In practice, however, such plans     <br />
    were overtaken again and again by the fundamental need to maintain        <br />
    social stability through continued employment, the desire by various      <br />
    interests to maintain the high-growth-rate model for their own financial  <br />
    and political ends, and the underlying structure of the Chinese           <br />
    bureaucracy, which had grown flabby, unwieldy and resistant to change.    <br />
                                                                              <br />
    Over the ensuing decade, there were occasional moves to streamline the    <br />
    Chinese economy and make it more sustainable: reform of state-owned       <br />
    enterprises (SOEs); accession to the World Trade Organization; banking    <br />
    reform; consolidation of heavy industry; and ultimately, the              <br />
    appreciation of the yuan. These initiatives often were peripheral,        <br />
    however, or only partially implemented. The question of social stability  <br />
    as a byproduct of high growth rates continued to drive political          <br />
    decisions on Chinaa**s economy.                                           <br />
                                                                              <br />
    The concern for stability became even more important as China began       <br />
    noting that emerging efficiencies in its industries and agriculture were  <br />
    pushing the 7 percent GDP growth floor ever higher a** to a minimum of 8  <br />
    percent after the Asian economic crisis, and later to 9 percent.          <br />
    Basically, the more China developed its industries and agriculture and    <br />
    made the processes more efficient, the fewer workers were needed for the  <br />
    same amount of production. Advancements in technology ironically also     <br />
    led to higher unemployment, particularly in the low-skill sectors. This   <br />
    meant that policies intended to eliminate (or at least reduce)            <br />
    redundancies, and to reshape the economy to focus on domestic             <br />
    consumer-driven demand rather than on exports and foreign investment,     <br />
    rarely gained the sustained traction necessary to c hange Chinaa**s       <br />
    deeper economic structures.                                               <br />
                                                                              <br />
     Postponing the Crisis                                                    <br />
                                                                              <br />
    By 2002, then-Premier Zhu Rongji was urging greater attention to          <br />
    statistics collection in China in order to draw a better picture of the   <br />
    real status of the economy. By early 2003, signs of internal              <br />
    inconsistencies were clearly apparent. As China underwent a leadership    <br />
    transition from the Jiang Zemin-Zhu Rongji government to the Hu           <br />
    Jintao-Wen Jiabao government, the picture was becoming clearer: China     <br />
    would face a future economic crisis along the lines of that suffered by   <br />
    the other Asian nations in 1997-1998 if it could not quickly reform its   <br />
    economic model.                                                           <br />
                                                                              <br />
    Beijing then began announcing a series of economic policies intended to   <br />
    stimulate the domestic economy, from plans to end lifetime employment     <br />
    for state workers to small-business loans for the unemployed and rural    <br />
    tax reform. At the end of 2003, however, when Chinaa**s top economic      <br />
    planners held their annual meeting, they came up with a very familiar     <br />
    assessment and an equally fa miliar plan: China needed to focus on        <br />
    quality, efficiency and sustainable growth rates, and the non-coastal     <br />
    economy needed to be bolstered through social spending and job creation   <br />
    to strengthen domestic demand and maintain employment levels. It was      <br />
    effectively the same thing the Jiang-Zhu team had said in 1998.           <br />
                                                                              <br />
    But once again, recognition of the problem did not necessarily translate  <br />
    into actual solutions. A slowdown in economic growth, induced in part by  <br />
    rising oil prices in 2003 and the impact of the SARS crisis, led to       <br />
    continued resistance among policymakers to broader reforms that would     <br />
    have created social dislocation (at least in the near term) as part of a  <br />
    deeper restructuring. Beijing did take some steps 2004 to slow the        <br />
    unrestrained growth, including rumors of a temporary halt in commercial   <br />
    lending, increases in banksa** capital reserve requirements and an        <br />
    October hike in interest rates.                                           <br />
                                                                              <br />
    But with annual official unemployment reaching 4.3 percent for 2003 a**   <br />
    up 0.3 percentage points from a year earlier a** the dragon was still     <br />
    breathing down Beijinga**s neck. The general trend of economic policy     <br />
    continued to encourage exports and investment as the primary drivers of   <br />
    the economy in order to mitigate the risk of massive unemployment.        <br />
    Chinese GDP growth, which had slipped down to 7.9 percent in the second   <br />
    quarter of 2003, was quickly lifted back above the 9 percent threshold    <br />
    in the third quarter and then continued to climb, hitting double-digit    <br />
    growth rates briefly in the second quarter of 2005 and holding at that    <br />
    rate from 2006 onward. Chinaa**s stock market, which had begun surging    <br />
    in the latter half of 2006, reached a peak in October 2007. The boom was  <br />
    also reflected in a massive rise in property prices and real estate       <br />
    construction and speculation, and in ballooning trade surplus and         <br />
    foreign currency reserves. Attempts to rein in rapid grow th had failed   <br />
    once again, as political considerations and bureaucratic stagnation       <br />
    undermined reform efforts.                                                <br />
                                                                              <br />
     Contraction and Crisis                                                   <br />
                                                                              <br />
    The contractions that occurred in late 2007 and early 2008, then, might   <br />
    well have been corrections to an overheating system. But corrections or   <br />
    not, these contractions began triggering unwelcome consequences, once     <br />
    again bringing to a head conflicting factional debates over economic      <br />
    policy.                                                                   <br />
                                                                              <br />
    By the second half of 2007, as international prices for oil and other     <br />
    key commodities began rising sharply, China started to feel the pinch.    <br />
    Inflation was increasing and margins in export-based industries were      <br />
    narrowing; this was compounded by the steady rise of the yuan, which      <br />
    discouraged demand in importing countries. Low-skilled export sectors     <br />
    such as the toy industry (suffering from a lead paint scandal) and        <br />
    textile industry were particularly hard-hit. Rising commodity prices      <br />
    also began affecting critical heavy industries like steel, though the     <br />
    full impact on metal and cement industries was buffered somewhat by the   <br />
    construction boom in Beijing ahead of the August 2008 Olympics.           <br />
                                                                              <br />
    By early 2008, fuel shortages were occurring, transportation was being    <br />
    disrupted by blizzards, the Shanghai Stock Exchange was falling, and      <br />
    real estate values were slowing. The threat of social unrest once again   <br />
    began to rear its head, from farmers protesting over land seizures to     <br />
    airline workers striking, to the Tibetan uprising in March.               <br />
                                                                              <br />
    Before the slowdown began, Beijing was already worried about the          <br />
    economic system a** particularly the widening divide between the coastal  <br />
    areas and the interior, the latter accounting for between two-thirds and  <br />
    three-quarters of the population. Chinese leaders had sought to slow      <br />
    down overheated growth rates through various measures, including an       <br />
    acceleration of the appreciation of the yuan and several interest rate    <br />
    hikes in 2006 and 2007. By July 2008, however, the compounding crises     <br />
    were more than apparent. At a special Politburo meeting on July 25,       <br />
    Chinaa**s leaders finally admitted that the crisis was much more          <br />
    significan t than the Olympics (which had been their near-obsession in    <br />
    the preceding year), and that action needed to be taken.                  <br />
                                                                              <br />
    As the economic crisis bubbled up, and as social stability began to       <br />
    weaken ahead of the Olympics, a political crisis was brewing in Beijing.  <br />
    Premier Wen Jiabao, though popular with the common people, was            <br />
    criticized strongly within the Party. He was seen by many in government   <br />
    and by Chinaa**s business community as lacking the skills necessary to    <br />
    maintain or reform the Chinese economy. At the special meeting of the     <br />
    Politburo in July, several of the economic policies implemented by Wen    <br />
    were suspended or reversed. Rumors even began to surface that Wen would   <br />
    a**resigna** at the National Peoplea**s Congress (NPC) session in March   <br />
    2009. These rumors are now being quelled, because the Party is concerned  <br />
    that, given Wena**s public popularity, his resignation could trigger new  <br />
    social turmoil among the masses. (Social affection for similar popular    <br />
    leaders contributed to the 1989 Tiananmen Square incident.) In addition,  <br />
    pushing Wen out early would undermine a 15-ye ar process of trying to     <br />
    stabilize leadership transitions in China.                                <br />
                                                                              <br />
    Around the same time as the July meeting, the precipitous spike in        <br />
    global commodity prices began to fall off, granting Beijing some          <br />
    breathing room during the Olympics. But Chinaa**s economic crisis (and    <br />
    Beijinga**s political crisis) was far from over. Economic turmoil was     <br />
    once again brought to the forefront just a few weeks later, as the U.S.   <br />
    financial system slipped into crisis mode and was quickly followed by     <br />
    the rest of the world. If the Chinese economy does not see marked         <br />
    improvement a** or at least stabilization a** by the March 2009 NPC       <br />
    session, not only Wen but many others could be forced to resign,          <br />
    triggering a fairly substantial political reshuffling and competition     <br />
    for power, and throwing the stability of the Party itself into question.  <br />
                                                                              <br />
     A Critical Moment                                                        <br />
                                                                              <br />
    Chinaa**s top economists, policy recommendation bodies and government     <br />
    officials are all searching for short-term fixes to maintain employment   <br />
    levels, seen as the key to social stability, amid the current downturn.   <br />
    At the same time, they are seeking to effect real change in the           <br />
    structure of the Chinese economy to strengthen it in the long term. That  <br />
    is much easier said than done.                                            <br />
                                                                              <br />
    Chinaa**s present economic stimulus package is a cobbled-together         <br />
    combination of previously existing initiatives. Overall, it is focused    <br />
    almost exclusively on maintaining that magic 9 percent GDP growth rate    <br />
    seen as vital to maintaining employment and therefore social stability.   <br />
    Even at the top levels, complete political buy-in for deeper reforms is   <br />
    lacking due to patronage, personal gain, and a very strong uncertainty    <br />
    that the reforms will even work without triggering more pronounced and    <br />
    immediate crises.                                                         <br />
                                                                              <br />
    Chinese economists cannot even agree on what a stable economy should      <br />
    look like. They are split between Western-trained and Asian-trained       <br />
    camps, and their views frequently clash. This means economic policy from  <br />
    the center is fragmented, unreliable and poorly enforced; Beijing tends   <br />
    to implement programs piecemeal and drop them when they do not work       <br />
    quickly. Meanwhile, the bureaucratic mechanisms to implement real         <br />
    economic policy reform down through the provincial and local levels are   <br />
    simply not there. Enforcement, incentive and oversight are all lacking,   <br />
    and Party cadres face the entrenched reality that promotion up through    <br />
    the ranks is still based almost solely on the criterion of their ability  <br />
    to maintain high rates of economic growth.                                <br />
                                                                              <br />
    Truly changing the Chinese economic system will almost certainly mean a   <br />
    major unhinging of the social order. Change of this magnitude simply is   <br />
    not going to be smooth a** it requires breaking the system and            <br />
    rebuilding it. Jianga**s reform of SOEs led to a significant rise in      <br />
    unemployment. Hua**s attempts to consolidate and make heavy industries    <br />
    more efficient triggered a similar problem. In other countries, there     <br />
    have been massive political and social upheavals that allowed partial     <br />
    reform of the system. In China, this path also has been used in the past  <br />
    (e.g., the Great Leap Forward, the Great Proletariat Cultural             <br />
    Revolution). But the current leadership is not sure the Party could       <br />
    survive another self-made crisis now that the economic and social         <br />
    evolution has come this far, particularly as there is no paramount        <br />
    leader like Mao Zedong to serve as a central point of unity.              <br />
                                                                              <br />
    In short, the Chinese leadership is once again running as fast as it can  <br />
    simply to stay in place. The economic bailout package is a case in point  <br />
    of knee-jerk policy ideas thrown out in a muddled heap a** few of which   <br />
    provide any clear direction other than to trying to keep growth high to   <br />
    avoid (or postpone indefinitely) a massive social dislocation, and none   <br />
    of which are likely to be carried out to completion.                      <br />
                                                                              <br />
    The Chinese system is reaching a critical moment. Many among the Chinese  <br />
    leadership see the next few years as the crisis point for China and the   <br />
    Party. Low-skilled export industries, which soak up a lot of migrant      <br />
    labor in China, were already closing down in 2007 and early 2008 as       <br />
    commodity prices rose and margins narrowed; now the European and U.S.     <br />
    slowdown is forcing even more to close their doors. Laid-off workers,     <br />
    frequently dismissed without pay, are beginning to protest, requiring     <br />
    local and central government intervention and payoffs to avoid widening   <br />
    unrest. The stock market has already crashed. The real estate market,     <br />
    another staple of Chinese middle-class investment and a field in which    <br />
    many of Chinaa**s SOEs have significant investments, is flagging. The     <br />
    steel industry, a bastion of Chinese heavy industry and an underwriter    <br />
    of many other segments of the economy, is facing a significant            <br />
    contraction. Beijing wants and needs to stimulate consumer spending, but  <br />
    e conomic uncertainties are prompting Chinese consumers to hold onto      <br />
    their money.                                                              <br />
                                                                              <br />
    On top of the financial woes, leaders in Beijing are raising concerns     <br />
    over potential social crises in 2009, triggered by anniversaries of key   <br />
    events including the 1959 Tibet uprising, the 1989 Tiananmen Square       <br />
    incident and the 1999 Falun Gong suppression. The Chinese also expect     <br />
    increased friction from the United States on trade issues as Washington   <br />
    faces its own economic problems and could be looking for a scapegoat.     <br />
    From Beijinga**s perspective, an untested President Barack Obama and a    <br />
    Democratic-controlled Congress (with protectionist sympathies) only       <br />
    increase the uncertainty.                                                 <br />
                                                                              <br />
    The Chinese are uncomfortable with implementing economic reform, however  <br />
    badly needed, during a global economic downturn. Before embarking on      <br />
    such a project, Beijing would prefer to have as much cash on hand as      <br />
    possible in order to deal with the social dislocation caused by economic  <br />
    restructuring. But Chinese leaders will have to plan on the slowdown in   <br />
    the U.S. and European economies lasting a year or more. This means        <br />
    Beijing cannot count on continued investment flows into the export        <br />
    industry to prop up the economy while the central government pushes       <br />
    forward with initiatives to increase wages and bolster labor rights in    <br />
    the wealthier coastal region, in hopes of pushing foreign investment      <br />
    inland.                                                                   <br />
                                                                              <br />
    Caught in the horns of a dilemma, Chinese leaders have no clear solution  <br />
    before them. The traditional method of putting a on a bandage to deal     <br />
    with the outward signs of the underlying cancer is likely to continue.    <br />
    For policymakers in Beijing, social stability takes precedence, as it     <br />
    has in the past. This means that, as before, reforms are likely to        <br />
    remain peripheral or short-lived, while the resource-intensive export     <br />
    industry will continue to get support. Beijing might be able to postpone  <br />
    a serious social and political crisis for a while longer, but every       <br />
    delay simply makes the ultimate crisis that much more catastrophic.       <br />
                                                                              <br />
    Beijinga**s policies are making it clear that the Chinese leadership      <br />
    does not really intend to let the current slowdown do what a slowdown is  <br />
    supposed to do: trim the fat and cull the weak, in the process            <br />
    increasing the efficiency of the economy and freeing up capital for new   <br />
    uses. Job security remains Beijinga**s primary concern, which means       <br />
    increasingly inefficient and unprofitable businesses will continue to be  <br />
    propped up by government money, export rebates, and probably an           <br />
    expansion of bad loans. But these policies will only prolong and worsen   <br />
    the problems, no matter how many a**newa** infrastructure projects are    <br />
    launched in the stimulus package. At some point, China will have to pay   <br />
    the piper. And as the global financial crisis has shown, an added         <br />
    external pressure can quickly arise that the Chinese cannot control, but  <br />
    that forces them to respond while domestic problems rapidly deteriorate.  <br />
