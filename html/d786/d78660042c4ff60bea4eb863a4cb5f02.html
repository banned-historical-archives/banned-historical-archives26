		<h3>Tor</h3>
		<p><a href="https://www.torproject.org">Tor</a> is an encrypted anonymising network that makes it harder to intercept internet communications, or see where communications are coming from or going to.</p>
		<p>In order to use the WikiLeaks public submission system as detailed above you can download the Tor Browser Bundle, which is a Firefox-like browser available for Windows, Mac OS X and GNU/Linux and pre-configured to connect using the anonymising system Tor.</p>
		<h4>Tails</h4>
		<p>If you are at high risk and you have the capacity to do so, you can also access the submission system through a secure operating system called <a href="https://tails.boum.org">Tails</a>. Tails is an operating system launched from a USB stick or a DVD that aim to leaves no traces when the computer is shut down after use and automatically routes your internet traffic through Tor. Tails will require you to have either a USB stick or a DVD at least 4GB big and a laptop or desktop computer.</p>

		<h3>Tips</h3>
		<p>Our submission system works hard to preserve your anonymity, but we recommend you also take some of your own precautions. Please review these basic guidelines. </p>
		<div>
			<h4>1. Contact us if you have specific problems</h4>
			<p>If you have a very large submission, or a submission with a complex format, or are a high-risk source, please <a href="#submit_help_contact">contact us</a>. In our experience it is always possible to find a custom solution for even the most seemingly difficult situations.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h4>2. What computer to use</h4>
			<p>If the computer you are uploading from could subsequently be audited in an investigation, consider using a computer that is not easily tied to you. Technical users can also use <a href="https://tails.boum.org">Tails</a> to help ensure you do not leave any records of your submission on the computer.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h4>3. Do not talk about your submission to others</h4>
			<p>If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in source protection – it is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This includes other media organisations.</p>
		</div>

	</div>
</div>

<div id="submit_help_after" class="submit_elem">

			</div>
		</div>

		<h3>After</h3>

		<div>
			<h4>1. Do not talk about your submission to others</h4>
			<p>If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in source protection – it is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This includes other media organisations.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h4>2. Act normal</h4>
			<p>If you are a high-risk source, avoid saying anything or doing anything after submitting which might promote suspicion. In particular, you should try to stick to your normal routine and behaviour.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h4>3. Remove traces of your submission</h4>
			<p>If you are a high-risk source and the computer you prepared your submission on, or uploaded it from, could subsequently be audited in an investigation, we recommend that you format and dispose of the computer hard drive and any other storage media you used.</p>
			<p>In particular, hard drives retain data after formatting which may be visible to a digital forensics team and flash media (USB sticks, memory cards and SSD drives) retain data even after a secure erasure. If you used flash media to store sensitive data, it is important to destroy the media.</p>
			<p>If you do this and are a high-risk source you should make sure there are no traces of the clean-up, since such traces themselves may draw suspicion.</p>
			<div>
				<h4>4. If you face legal action</h4>
				<p>If a legal action is brought against you as a result of your submission, there are organisations that may help you. The Courage Foundation is an international organisation dedicated to the protection of journalistic sources. You can find more details at <a href="https://www.couragefound.org">https://www.couragefound.org</a>.</p>

		<p>WikiLeaks publishes documents of political or historical importance that are censored or otherwise suppressed. We specialise in strategic global publishing and large archives.</p>
		<p>The following is the address of our secure site where you can anonymously upload your documents to WikiLeaks editors. You can only access this submissions system through Tor. (See our <a href="#submit_help_tor">Tor tab</a> for more information.) We also advise you to read our <a href="#submit_help_tips">tips for sources</a> before submitting.</p>

   I really think you are missing the most important part of this whole<br />
   thing.  The thing that ties it all togeether.  WE have discussed it on the<br />
   lists before, and I alluded to it here:<br />
   http://www.stratfor.com/analysis/20110405-china-security-memo-april-6-2011<br />
<br />
   The CPC is for whatever reason scared shitless of all these dissent<br />
   possiblities--Jasmine, christians, tibetans, chenguan conflicts, etc. <br />
   They are cracking down extremely harshly because they know the economy is<br />
   in trouble or on a teeter totter that they are afraid of flipping over. <br />
   Thus, their reaction has shown their concern, rather than their public<br />
   statements.  They have sent 3 or so guys to labor camps, they have locked<br />
   up every dissident and HR lawyer they can get their hands on.  They have<br />
   shut down any and all public demonstrations. <br />
<br />
   They are going into lockdown mode and are not willing to take risks.  But<br />
   this is risky in and of itself, if someone gets hurt or if they get to<br />
   brutal and it starts a backlash, they could be in a lot of trouble.  They<br />
   could spark more (and real) protests themselves inadvertantly.  This is<br />
   more likely because of the insecurity over the 2012 transition and the<br />
   commonality of local leaders acting out. <br />
<br />
   I really think you need to include this bit, and I can help you with it if<br />
   needed. <br />

     China:The End of the Deng Dynasty [snap]<br />
<br />
      <br />
<br />
     In recent weeks months China has become perceptibly more anxious than<br />
     usual. The government has launched the most extensive security campaign<br />
     to suppress political dissent since the aftermath of Tiananmen square<br />
     crackdown in 1989[though this crackdown considered well into the 1990s],<br />
     arresting and disappearing journalists, bloggers and artists. The<br />
     crackdown was apparently prompted by fears that foreign forces and<br />
     domestic dissidents have hatched a a**Jasminea** plot to ignite protests<br />
     inspired by recent events in the Middle East.[apparently prompted??? <br />
     Let's say it was definitely a response to TWO things 1. the belief that<br />
     foreign forces were tryign to start shit 2. the knowledge that their<br />
     economy is fucked and they are susceptible.  The second is really the<br />
     most importnat.  IT's also historically backed by the fear of foreign<br />
     forces and economic turnover.]<br />
<br />
      <br />
<br />
     Meanwhile the economy maintains a furious pace of credit-fueled growth,<br />
     despite authorities repeated claims of pulling back on the reins to<br />
     prevent excessive inflation and systemic financial risks. The<br />
     governmenta**s cautiousness on inflation has emboldened local<br />
     governments and state companies who benefit from devil-may-care growth<br />
     uh, what does this mean?; yet inflationa**s risks to socio-political<br />
     stability have encouraged a tougher stance. The government is thus beset<br />
     by perils of economic overheating or overcorrection, either of which<br />
     could trigger an explosionWC [would use outbreak] of social unrest, and<br />
     leading to erratic policymaking. <br />
<br />
      <br />
<br />
     These security and economic challenges are taking place at a time when<br />
     the transition from the so-called fourth generation leaders to fifth<br />
     generation leaders in 2012 has gotten under way, heightening factional<br />
     contests over economic policy and further complicating attempts to take<br />
     decisive action. [as well as nervousness or insecurity over staiblity,<br />
     and thus more brash actions by officials.]<br />
<br />
      <br />
<br />
     Yet there is something still deeper that is driving the Communist<br />
     Partya**s anxiety and heavy-handed security measures. The need to<br />
     transform the countrya**s entire economic model brings with it hazards<br />
     that the party fears will jeopardize the legitimacy of the party itself.<br />
<br />
      <br />
<br />
     NEW CHALLENGES TO DENGa**S MODEL<br />
<br />
      <br />
<br />
     Deng Xiaoping is well known for launching Chinaa**s emergence from the<br />
     dark days of Chairman Maoa**s Cultural Revolution and inaugurating the<br />
     rise of a modern, internationally-oriented economic giant. Denga**s<br />
     model rested on three pillars. First, pragmatism toward the economy,<br />
     allowing for capitalist-style incentives domestically and channels for<br />
     international trade. By opening space for industry, Deng paved the way<br />
     for a growth boom that would provide employment and put an end to<br />
     ceaseless civil strife. The partya**s legitimacy famously became linked<br />
     to the countrya**s economic success, rather than ideological zeal.<br />
<br />
      <br />
<br />
     Second, a foreign policy of openness and cooperation. The lack of<br />
     emphasis on political ideology and nativism opened space for<br />
     international movement[WC.  'international movement' sounds weird to<br />
     me], with economic cooperation the basis for new relationships. This<br />
     gave enormous impetus to the Sino-American dA(c)tente that Nixon had<br />
     contrived with Mao. In Denga**s words, China would maintain a low<br />
     profile and avoid taking the lead. It was to be unobtrusive so as to<br />
     befriend and do business with almost any country (as long as they<br />
     recognized Beijing as the one and only China).[do you want to talk in<br />
     here about how they decided to become a world ower, but be stealthy<br />
     about it]<br />
<br />
      <br />
<br />
     Third, Deng maintained the primacy of the Communist Party. Reform of the<br />
     political system along the lines of western countries could be<br />
     envisioned, but in practice deferred. This policy of party supremacy was<br />
     sealed after the mass protests at Tiananmen, crushed by the military<br />
     after dangerous intra-party struggle. The Peoplea**s Liberation Army and<br />
     the newly established Peoplea**s Armed Police would serve as Denga**s<br />
     a**Great Wall of steela** protecting the party from insurrection.<br />
<br />
      <br />
<br />
     For three decades, Denga**s model has stayed for the most part intact.<br />
     There have been important modifications and shifts, but the general<br />
     framework stands, because chinese-style capitalism and partnership with<br />
     the U.S. served the country well. Moreover, unlike Mao, Deng secured his<br />
     policy by establishing a succession plan. He was instrumental in setting<br />
     up his immediate successor Jiang Zemin as well as Jianga**s successor,<br />
     current President Hu Jintao. Hua**s policies do not differ from Denga**s<br />
     as widely as is often claimed[who claims this? why?]. Chinaa**s response<br />
     to the global economic crisis in 2008 revealed that Hu sought recourse<br />
     to the same export and investment driven growth model as his<br />
     predecessors. Hua**s plans of boosting  household consumption have<br />
     failed, the economy remains more off-balance than ever, and the interior<br />
     remains badly in need of development. But along the general lines of<br />
     Denga**s policy, the country has continued to grow, stay out of conflict<br />
     with the U.S. or others, and remain indisputably in control.<br />
<br />
      <br />
<br />
     However, in recent years unprecedented structural? challenges[or<br />
     something to make it clear that they are not political challenges from<br />
     CPC] to Denga**s model have emerged. First, the economic model is more<br />
     clearly than ever in need of restructuring. Economic crisis and its<br />
     aftermath in the developed world have caused a shortfall in foreign<br />
     demand, and rising costs of labor and raw materials are eroding<br />
     Chinaa**s comparative advantage, even as its export sector has become so<br />
     massive as to be competing with itself to claim a slice of nearly<br />
     saturated markets. this may require a bit more explanation or<br />
     simplification in phrasing to explain how China is 'competing with<br />
     itself' in saturated markets The answer has been, theoretically, to<br />
     boost household consumption and rebalance growth a** the Hu<br />
     administrationa**s policy a** but this plan would bring extreme hazards<br />
     if aggressively pursued. If consumption cannot be generated quickly<br />
     enough to pick up the slack (and it cannot within the narrow time frame<br />
     what's that time frame? Chinaa**s leaders envision), growth will slow<br />
     sharply and unemployment will rise, causing serious threats to a party<br />
     whose legitimacy rests on its providing growth.<br />
<br />
      <br />
<br />
     Not coincidentally, new movements have arisen that seek to restore the<br />
     partya**s prestige based not on economics, but on the partya**s<br />
     inherent, ideological power. Hu Jintaoa**s faction, rooted in the<br />
     Chinese Communist Youth League (CCYL), has a clear doctrine and party<br />
     orientation, and has set the stage to expand its control when the sixth<br />
     generation of leaders arrive. has there been any modification to the<br />
     party's ideology to adjust to the current conditions, or is it the same<br />
     old mantra?<br />
<br />
      <br />
<br />
     Yet this trend toward ideological justification transcends factions[of<br />
     course it does, they all have mutual interest in staying in power]. Bo<br />
     Xilai, the popular party chief in Chongqing, is a a**princelinga** a**<br />
     sons or daughters of Communist revolutionaries that are often given<br />
     prized positions in state leadership and in large state-owned<br />
     enterprises. The princelings are generally at odds with the CCYL, but<br />
     they are not a wholly coherent group[they are also just a stereotype. <br />
     they don't have a unifying institution like the CCYL.  but maybe there<br />
     is another institution?. The likely future president Xi Jinping, also a<br />
     princeling, is often stereotyped as a promoter of economic growth at any<br />
     cost, but Bo made his name striking down organized crime leaders who had<br />
     grown rich and powerful off the massive influx of new money and by<br />
     bribing officials. Boa**s campaign of nostalgia for the Mao era,<br />
     including singing revolutionary songs and launching a Red microblog[What<br />
     is a Red microblog? is that a website? is that what it's called?], is<br />
     hugely popular [LINK],adding an unusual degree of popular support to his<br />
     bid for a spot on the Politburo standing committee in 2012. Powerful<br />
     princelings in the upper ranks of the PLA are thought to be behind its<br />
     growing self-confidence and confrontational attitude toward foreign<br />
     rivals. <br />
<br />
      <br />
<br />
     This points to the second challenge to Denga**s legacy. The foreign<br />
     policy of inoffensiveness for the sake of commerce has come under fire.<br />
     so basically, the old ideology isn't sufficient to deal with China's<br />
     current problems, causing contradictions to the ideology itself.  might<br />
     help to explain that more clearly, tracing back to those key principles<br />
     you mentioned earlier Vastly more dependent on foreign natural<br />
     resources, and yet insecure because of ineffectualness in affecting<br />
     prices and vulnerability of supply lines, China has turned to the PLA to<br />
     take a greater role in protecting its global interests. As a result the<br />
     PLA has become more forceful in driving its policies, at times seeming<br />
     as if it were capable of overriding the current set of leaders who lack<br />
     military experience, violating the CPC principle of civilian rule. In<br />
     recent years China has pushed harder on territorial claims and more<br />
     staunchly defended partners like North Korea, Iran, Pakistan and<br />
     Myanmar. This has alarmed its neighbors and the United States a** a<br />
     trend especially observable throughout 2010. The PLA is not the only<br />
     outfit that seems increasingly bold. Chinese government officials and<br />
     state companies have also caused worry among foreigners. But it is by<br />
     far the most important.[but i hink in many ways this is what Deng<br />
     wanted.  He had a 4- or 5-principle thing for china's military/security<br />
     buildup.  about being stealth, but then surprising the world]  if true,<br />
     then that's pretty key... was 'peace with everyone' concept just one of<br />
     several phases?  or it simply that china has outgrown that phrase?<br />
      similar thing is happening with Turkey in which its naive 'zero<br />
     problems with neighbors' policy is hitting against walls <br />
<br />
      <br />
<br />
     Third, Denga**s avoidance of political reform may be becoming harder to<br />
     maintain. The stark disparities in wealth and public services between<br />
     social classes and regions have fueled dissatisfaction. Arbitrary power,<br />
     selective enforcement of the law, official corruption, crony capitalism,<br />
     and other ills have gnawed away at public content, giving rise to more<br />
     and more frequent incidents and outbursts. The social fabric is torn,<br />
     and leaders fear that widespread unrest could ignite. Simultaneously,<br />
     rising education, incomes and new forms of social organization like NGOs<br />
     and the internet have given rise to greater demands and new means of<br />
     coordination that dissidents or opposition movements could use.<br />
<br />
      <br />
<br />
     In this atmosphere Premier Wen Jiabao has become outspoken, calling for<br />
     the party to pursue political reforms in keeping with economic reforms.<br />
     Wena**s comments contain just enough ambiguity to suggest that he is<br />
     promoting radical change or diverging from the party, though he may<br />
     intend them only to pacify people by preserving hope for changes in the<br />
     unspecified future. Regardless, it is becoming harder for the party to<br />
     maintain economic development without addressing political grievances.<br />
     Political changes seem necessary not only for the sake of pursuing<br />
     oft-declared plans to unleash household consumption and domestic<br />
     innovation and services, but also to ease social discontentment. The<br />
     possibility has reemerged for the party to split on the question of<br />
     political reform, as happened in the 1980s. <br />
<br />
      <br />
<br />
     These new challenges to Denga**s theory reveal a rising uncertainty in<br />
     China about whether Denga**s solutions are still adequate in securing<br />
     the countrya**s future. Essentially, the rise of Maoist nostalgia, the<br />
     princelinga**s Cultural Revolution-esque glorification of their<br />
     bloodline and the Communist Youth Leaguea**s promotion of ideology and<br />
     wealth redistribution, imply a growing fear that the economic transition<br />
     may fail and the party will need a more aggressive security presence and<br />
     a more ideological basis for the legitimacy of its rule. A more<br />
     assertive military implies growing fear that a foreign policy of<br />
     meekness and amiability is insufficient to protect Chinaa**s heavier<br />
     dependencies on foreign trade from those who feel threatened by its<br />
     rising power, such as Japan, India or the United States. And a more<br />
     strident premier in favor of political reform may suggest fear that<br />
     growing demands for political change will lead to upheaval unless they<br />
     are addressed and alleviated.  <br />
<br />
      <br />
<br />
     At this moment, Beijing is struggling to contain these challenges to the<br />
     status quo within the same cycle that has characterized the past three<br />
     decades. The cycle is recognizable but the fluctuations are widening and<br />
     the policy reactions becoming more sudden and extreme. The country is<br />
     continuing to pursue the same path of economic development, even<br />
     sacrificing more ambitious rebalancing in order to re-emphasize, in the<br />
     2011-15 Five Year Plan, what are basically the traditional methods of<br />
     growth: massive credit expansion fueling large-scale infrastructure<br />
     expansion and technology upgrades for the export-oriented manufacturing<br />
     sector, all provided for by transferring wealth from depositors to<br />
     state-owned corporations and local governments. Whatever modifications<br />
     are in the plan are slight, and attempts at alternatives to the overall<br />
     growth model have not yet borne fruit.<br />
<br />
      <br />
<br />
     unclear here on what the transition is supposed to be...  earlier you<br />
     were describing why the Deng ideology had come under great strain and<br />
     how that was manifesting itself in more aggressive foreign policy, etc;<br />
      what's the underlying reason for this shift back to peace-loving China<br />
     if we're still talking about trending away from Deng?  Also China has<br />
     signaled that it is backing away from last yeara**s foreign policy<br />
     assertiveness. Hu and Obama met in Washington in January and declared a<br />
     thaw in relations. Recently Hu announced a a**new security concepta**<br />
     for the region saying that cooperation and peaceful negotiation remain<br />
     official Chinese policy, and China respects the a**presence and<br />
     interestsa** of outsiders in the region, a new and significant comment<br />
     in light of the United Statesa** reengagement with the region.  The U.S.<br />
     has to an extent approved of Chinaa**s backpedaling, saying the Chinese<br />
     navy has been less assertive this year than last, and has quieted many<br />
     of its threats. The two sides seem prepared to engineer a return to<br />
     six-party talks to manage North Korea.<br />
<br />
      <br />
<br />
     Finally, the harsh security crackdown under way since February a** part<br />
     of a longer trend of security tightening a** shows that the state<br />
     remains committed to Denga**s denying political reform indefinitely, and<br />
     choosing strict social control instead. A narrative has emerged in<br />
     western media blaming the princelings for the current crackdown,<br />
     suggesting this faction is behind it[is this narrative really that<br />
     strong? or was it just that one article?]. Chinese officials themselves<br />
     have leaked such ideas. But the fact remains that Hu Jintao is still<br />
     head of the party, state and military. Hu earned himself a reputation of<br />
     a strong hand by quelling disturbances in Tibet during his term as party<br />
     chief, and as president oversaw the crushing of rebellions in Lhasa and<br />
     Urumqi, and the tight security in the lead up to the Olympics. He is<br />
     more than capable of leading a nationwide suppression campaign.<br />
<br />
      <br />
<br />
     There can be no attribution of the crackdown solely to the princelings,<br />
     a faction that is not yet in power. The princelings are expected to<br />
     regain the advantage among the core leadership in 2012. In fact, the<br />
     CCYL faction may benefit from pinning the blame for harsh policies on<br />
     its opponents. The truth is that regardless of the faction, the<br />
     suppression campaign, and reinvigorated efforts at what the CPC calls<br />
     a**social management,a** have the support of the core of the party,<br />
     which maintains its old position against dissent.   <br />
<br />
      <br />
<br />
     Hence Deng has not yet been thrown out of the window.WHOA! Can't say<br />
     this.  His son was literally thrown out of a window is now in a wheel<br />
     chair.    hahaha, wow But the new currents of military assertiveness,<br />
     ideological zeal and political reform have revealed not only differences<br />
     in vision among the elite, but a rising concern among them for their<br />
     position ahead of the leadership transition. Sackings and promotions are<br />
     already accelerating. Unorthodox trends suggest that leaders and<br />
     institutions are hedging political bets so as to protect themselves,<br />
     their interests and their cliques, in case the economic transition goes<br />

<br />
     THE GRAVITY OF 2012<br />
<br />
      <br />
<br />
     As the jockeying for power ahead of the 2012 transition has already<br />
     begun in earnest, signs of incoherent and conflicting policy directives<br />
     suggest that the center of power is undefined.  Tensions are rising<br />
     between the factions as they try to secure their positions without<br />
     upsetting the balance and jeopardizing a smooth transfer of power.  The<br />
     governmenta**s arrests of dissidents underline its fear of these growing<br />
     tensions, as well as its sharp reactions to threats that could mar the<br />
     legacy of the current administration and hamper the rise of the new<br />
     administration.  Everything is in flux, and the cracks in the system are<br />
     lengthening.<br />
<br />
      <br />
<br />
     Regardless of any factional infighting intensifying the security<br />
     situation, a major question that arises is how long the party will be<br />
     able to maintain the current high level of vigilance without triggering<br />
     a backlash.  The government has effectively silenced critics who were<br />
     deemed possible of fomenting a larger movement. The masses have yet to<br />
     rally in significant numbers in a coordinated way that could threaten<br />
     the state. But tense security after the self-immolation at a Tibetan<br />
     monastery in Sichuan and spontaneous gatherings opposed to police<br />
     brutality in Shanghai provide just two recent examples of how a small<br />
     event could turn into something bigger.  [but these kind of tensions<br />
     have always existed the last decade.  this is notthing new.  what's new<br />
     is the organization of the jasmine, even if small, and MOST IMPORTANTLY<br />
     the wya the CPC has responded.  we really need to talk about the regime,<br />
     not the oppositionAs security becomes more oppressive in the lead up to<br />
     the transition -- and easing of control unlikely before then or even in<br />
     the following year as the new government seeks to consolidate power a**<br />
     the heavy hand of the state may cause greater aggravation and<br />
     resistance.<br />
<br />
      <br />
<br />
     When Deng sought to step down, his primary challenges were how to loosen<br />
     economic control, how to create a foreign policy conducive to trade, and<br />
     how to forestall democratic challenges to the regime. He also had to<br />
     leverage his prestige in the military and party to establish a reliable<br />
     succession plan from Jiang to Hu that would set the country on a<br />
     prosperous path.<br />
<br />
      <br />
<br />
     As Hu seeks to step down, his challenges are to prevent economic<br />
     overheating, avoid or counter any humiliating turn in foreign affairs<br />
     such as greater American pressure, and forestall unrest from economic<br />
     left-behinds, migrants or other aggrieved groups. Hu cannot allow the<br />
     party (or his legacy) to be marred by mass protests or economic collapse<br />
     under his watch. Yet he has to hand off the baton without Denga**s<br />
     prestige among the military and without a succession plan clad in<br />
     Denga**s armor.<br />
<br />
      <br />
<br />
     Hu is the last Chinese leader to have been directly appointed by Deng.<br />
     It is not clear whether Chinaa**s next generation of leaders will<br />
     augment Denga**s theory, or discard it. But it is clear that China is<br />
     taking on a challenge much greater than a change in president or<br />
     administration. It has already waded deep into a total economic<br />
     transformation unlike anything since 1978 a** and the greatest risk to<br />
     the partya**s legitimacy since 1989.   <br />
