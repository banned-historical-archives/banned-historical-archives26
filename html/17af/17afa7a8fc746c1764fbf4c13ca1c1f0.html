		<h3>Tor</h3>
		<p><a href="https://www.torproject.org">Tor</a> is an encrypted anonymising network that makes it harder to intercept internet communications, or see where communications are coming from or going to.</p>
		<p>In order to use the WikiLeaks public submission system as detailed above you can download the Tor Browser Bundle, which is a Firefox-like browser available for Windows, Mac OS X and GNU/Linux and pre-configured to connect using the anonymising system Tor.</p>
		<h4>Tails</h4>
		<p>If you are at high risk and you have the capacity to do so, you can also access the submission system through a secure operating system called <a href="https://tails.boum.org">Tails</a>. Tails is an operating system launched from a USB stick or a DVD that aim to leaves no traces when the computer is shut down after use and automatically routes your internet traffic through Tor. Tails will require you to have either a USB stick or a DVD at least 4GB big and a laptop or desktop computer.</p>

		<h3>Tips</h3>
		<p>Our submission system works hard to preserve your anonymity, but we recommend you also take some of your own precautions. Please review these basic guidelines. </p>
		<div>
			<h4>1. Contact us if you have specific problems</h4>
			<p>If you have a very large submission, or a submission with a complex format, or are a high-risk source, please <a href="#submit_help_contact">contact us</a>. In our experience it is always possible to find a custom solution for even the most seemingly difficult situations.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h4>2. What computer to use</h4>
			<p>If the computer you are uploading from could subsequently be audited in an investigation, consider using a computer that is not easily tied to you. Technical users can also use <a href="https://tails.boum.org">Tails</a> to help ensure you do not leave any records of your submission on the computer.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h4>3. Do not talk about your submission to others</h4>
			<p>If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in source protection – it is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This includes other media organisations.</p>
		</div>

	</div>

		<h3>After</h3>

		<div>
			<h4>1. Do not talk about your submission to others</h4>
			<p>If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in source protection – it is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This includes other media organisations.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h4>2. Act normal</h4>
			<p>If you are a high-risk source, avoid saying anything or doing anything after submitting which might promote suspicion. In particular, you should try to stick to your normal routine and behaviour.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h4>3. Remove traces of your submission</h4>
			<p>If you are a high-risk source and the computer you prepared your submission on, or uploaded it from, could subsequently be audited in an investigation, we recommend that you format and dispose of the computer hard drive and any other storage media you used.</p>
			<p>In particular, hard drives retain data after formatting which may be visible to a digital forensics team and flash media (USB sticks, memory cards and SSD drives) retain data even after a secure erasure. If you used flash media to store sensitive data, it is important to destroy the media.</p>
			<p>If you do this and are a high-risk source you should make sure there are no traces of the clean-up, since such traces themselves may draw suspicion.</p>
			<div>
				<h4>4. If you face legal action</h4>
				<p>If a legal action is brought against you as a result of your submission, there are organisations that may help you. The Courage Foundation is an international organisation dedicated to the protection of journalistic sources. You can find more details at <a href="https://www.couragefound.org">https://www.couragefound.org</a>.</p>

		<p>WikiLeaks publishes documents of political or historical importance that are censored or otherwise suppressed. We specialise in strategic global publishing and large archives.</p>
		<p>The following is the address of our secure site where you can anonymously upload your documents to WikiLeaks editors. You can only access this submissions system through Tor. (See our <a href="#submit_help_tor">Tor tab</a> for more information.) We also advise you to read our <a href="#submit_help_tips">tips for sources</a> before submitting.</p>

			<!--<div>
				Copy this address into your Tor browser. Advanced users, if they wish, can also add a further layer of encryption to their submission using <a href="#submit_wlkey">our public PGP key</a>.
			</div>-->
		</div>

		<p>If you cannot use Tor, or your submission is very large, or you have specific requirements, WikiLeaks provides several alternative methods. <a href="#submit_help_contact">Contact us</a> to discuss how to proceed.</p>

1.  IN PP, INFORMED SOURCES SAY GKR WILL ANNOUNCE NEW
PEACE INIATIVE IN EFFORT TO START &quot;UNCONDITIONAL
TALKS WITH ALL POLITICAL SEGMENTS&quot; ON ENDING WAR.
DIPLOMATSAND OBSERVERS SAY PLAN EVIDENTLY REPLACES
GKR'S SIX-POINT PROPOSAL OF LAST JULY (AP, SUN).
IN PRESS CONFERENCE ATTENDED BY GKR OFFICIALS AND
DIPLOMATIC CORPS, LONG BORET ANNOUNCES APPEAL TO
&quot;KHMERS OF THE OTHER SIDE&quot; TO HOLD PEACE NEGOTIATIONS
WITHOUT PRIOR CONDITIONS.  LON NOL REPEATS MESSAGE
UNCLASSIFIED

UNCLASSIFIED

PAGE 02  STATE  147692

IN RADIO BROADCAST, ADDS THAT GKR MIL SITUATION
MUCH IMPROVED SINCE LAST YEAR'S PEACE PROPOSALS
THAT WERE IGNORED BY COMMUNISTS.  FOREIGN OBSERVERS
THINK THAT WHILE GKR CONTROLS PRINCIPAL TOWNS AND
ALMOST 3/4 OF POPULATION, INSURGENTS CONTROL 3/4
OF COUNTRYSIDE.  IN PAST YEAR REBELS LAUNCHED MAJOR
ATTACKS ON NUMBER OF PRINCIPAL TOWNS BUT CAPTURED
ONLY OUDONG (REUTER PP).

2.  FIELD REPORTERS SAY FANK RECON PATROL REACHES OUTSKIRTS
OF OUDONG, REPORTS NO SIGNS OF REBEL ACTIVITY IN
FORMER ROYALCAPITAL BUT GKR TASK FORCE HALF-MILE
AWAY MAKES NO ATTEMPT TO ASSAULT CITY (CHITRIB).
3.  POLICE SURROUND NATL ASSEMBLY BUILDING
TO STOP LAOTIANS FROM SIGNING PETITION CALLING FOR
WITHDRAWAL OF NVN FORCES IN ACCORDANCE WITH C-F.  INFORMED
SOURCES SAY POLICE WERE FROM JOINT POLICE FORCE, INCOR-
PORATING BOTH FACTIONS, AND REPORTEDLY RECEIVED ORDERS
FROM SOUVANNA AFTER TWO ASSEMBLYMEN INVITED PEOPLE
TO GO TO SIGN PETITION.  ASSEMBLY PRESENTLY TAKES
NO PART IN ACTUAL GOVERNMENT OF COUNTRY.  DEFMIN
SISOUK SAID AFTER JUNE 4 WITHDRAWAL DEADLINE
FOR FOREIGN FORCES THAT 14,500 NVN TROOPS REMAIN
IN COUNTRY AS WELL AS 24-29,000 ALONG HO TRAIL.
PL CHARGES US AND THAI TROOPS ARE STILL IN LAOS
(REUTER VIENTIANE).

CHINA

4.  US NEWS AND WR &quot;WASHINGTON WHISPERS &quot; (JULY
15) SAYS: &quot;WHITE HOUSE INSIDERS EXPECT A TRIP
TO PEKING BY PRESIDENT NIXON AS A LOGICAL SEQUEL
TO THE MOSCOW SUMMIT.  BELIEF IS THAT MR. NIXON
MAY ANNOUNCE HIS SECOND JOURNEY TO CHINA LATE
THIS YEAR.&quot;

5.  AT TELEVISED NEWS CONFERENCE MONDAY, SEN.
JACKSON HANDED OUT PRINTED STATEMENT PROPOSING
THAT ADMIN. &quot;SHOULD TRY TO REVERSE THE LOCATION
OF OUR EMBASSY AND LIAISON OFFICE AS BETWEEN
TAIPEI AND PEKING.&quot;  SENATOR ALSO URGED THAT
UNCLASSIFIED

UNCLASSIFIED

PAGE 03  STATE  147692

US PRESS TOWARD &quot;NEW DEPARTURES IN SINO-AMERICAN
RELATIONS, INCLUDING THE ESTABLISHMENT OF RESIDENT
CORRESPONDENTS IN EACH COUNTRY AND MORE SUBSTANTIAL
PROGRAMS OF CULTURAL AND EDUCATIONAL EXCHANGES&quot;
(UPI NYDN, PHINQ).  REPORTING THAT HE HAD MORE
THAN 15 HOURS OF DETAILED CONVERSATIONS WITH
CHOU EN-LAI, TENG HSIAO-PING, CHIAO KUAN-HUA
AND OTHER OFFICIALS, JACKSON SAID CHOU IS CONVALESCING
AND THAT HE FOUND PREMIER ALERT AND KEEN-MINDED.

NYT'S BINDER NOTES THAT JACKSON SAID PRC
CAN BE TRUSTED MORE THAN SOVIET AS AN INTERNATIONAL
PARTNER, AND THAT &quot;THERE ARE MANY AREAS IN WHICH
AMERICAN INTERESTS PARALLEL THOSE OF THE CHINESE.&quot;
ACCORDING BINDER, SENATOR ALSO MAINTAINED IT
SHOULD BE EASY TO GRANT GOOD TRADING TERMS TO
CHINA BECAUSE PROBLEM OF CHINESE DESIRING TO
LEAVE TO JOIN FAMILIES IS NOT LARGE.  SAID HE
KNEW OF ONLY 80 CHINESE IN THIS PREDICAMENT,
ALTHOUGH &quot;THERE WILL BE A LOT MORE.&quot;  CSM DISPATCH
CITES JACKSON SAYING HE FOUND IN CHINA THAT SINO-

SOVIET &quot;FISSURE APPEARS TO BE WIDENING,&quot; AND
THAT HIS HOSTS WERE &quot;EXTREMELY FORTHRIGHT AND
DIRECT&quot; AND PULLED NO PUNCHES.

SUN'S MILLS OBSERVES JACKSON REPORTED THAT
HE HAD NOT RAISED WITH CHINESE IDEA OF ESTABLISHING
FULL DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS WITH US, BUT BELIEVED
THAT ONCE THIS IS DONE AND US-GROC RELATIONS
ARE DOWNGRADED, THEN IMPROVED SINO-US RELATIONS
WILL FOLLOW.  MILLS REPORTS THAT SOME AMERICAN
CHINA-WATCHERS, INFORMED OF JACKSON'S STATEMENT,
WERE SKEPTICAL THAT PRC WOULD EVER ACCEPT HIS
PROPOSAL; THEY POINTED OUT THAT PEKING HAS DEMANDED,
AS PRECONDITION TO ESTABLISHING DIPLOMATIC TIES
WITH OTHER WESTERN COUNTRIES, THAT THEY BREAK
COMPLETELY WITH GROC.  MILLS POINTS OUT THAT
ANOTHER BLOCK TO FULL RELATIONS WITH PEKING IS
US DEFENSE TREATY WITH GROC -- AND JACKSON SAID
MONDAY THAT HE IS &quot;NOT SUGGESTING THAT WE BACK

PAGE 04  STATE  147692

OUT ON OUR COMMITMENT.&quot;

WP'S BERGER CONCLUDES THAT JACKSON'S NEWS
CONFERENCE HAD EARMARKS OF PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN
PRODUCTION.  SHE ALSO OBSERVES THAT US RELATIONSHIP
WITH PEKING HAS BEEN LARGELY IN HAK'S HANDS,
WITH USLO &quot;PERFORMING MAINLY CONSULAR FUNCTIONS.&quot;

REUTER (PEKING) REPORTS THAT PRC FM SPOKESMEN
DECLINED COMMENT TUESDAY ON FOREIGN PRESS REPORTS
THAT CHOU EN-LAI IS SUFFERING FROM HEART AILMENT;
AN FM OFFICIAL DEALING WITH PRESS QUERIES REPLIED,
&quot;I DON'T KNOW.  THAT IS ALL I CAN SAY.&quot;  IN PEKING,
GLOBE AND MAIL'S BURNS REPORTS CHINESE PEOPLE
ENTERTAINING CONCERNS ABOUT CHOU'S HEALTH; &quot;TO
HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF PEOPLE WHO RELY ON THE PARTY
PRESS FOR ALL THEIR INFORMATION ON THE LEADERS,
(NCNA'S &quot;TUCKED-AWAY&quot; DISCLOSURE THAT CHOU MET
JACKSON &quot;IN A HOSPITAL&quot;) WOULD CAUSE DISTRESS SECOND
ONLY TO THE ACTUAL DEMISE&quot; OF CHOU OR MAO.  SAYS
FOR THIS REASON ALONE, DECISION TO GO PUBLIC WITH
PREMIER'S HOSPITALIZATION WAS EXTRAORDINARY.  ONLY
SENSIBLE CONCLUSION IS THAT CHOU WOULD HAVE LEFT
HOSPITAL TO MEET SENATOR IF HE HAD FELT UP TO IT;
THAT HE DID NOT, IS, ON FACE OF IT, SUREST INDICATION
THAT HE IS PERHAPS RATHER MORE ILL THAN HITHERTO
THOUGHT (CSM).

7.  WP (PEKING) REPORTS THAT FOR FIRST TIME IN MORE THAN
MONTH, TWO DAYS HAVE PASSED WITHOUT APPEARANCE OF

NEW POSTERS ON WALLS IN CAPITAL.  REUTER'S SHARP,
IN PEKING, SAYS POSTER CAMPAIGN &quot;NOW SEEMS TO
BE FIZZLING OUT.&quot;  ALL BUT HANDFUL OF HUNDREDS OF
POSTERS HAVE BEEN TORN DOWN OR DEFACED, AND EVEN
THOSE UNTOUCHED BECOMING INCREASINGLY TATTERED
AND LESS LEGIBLE AS WEATHER TAKES ITS TOLL.  ALTHOUGH
SOME POSTER WRITERS &quot;OBVIOUSLY WENT OVERBOARD,&quot;
GLANCE AT INTENSE FACES OF CROWDS WHO GATHERED
DAY AND NIGHT TO READ POSTERS WAS ENOUGH TO CONVINCE
ANYONE THAT &quot;THIS REMARKABLE INTERLUDE IN THE
UNCLASSIFIED

UNCLASSIFIED

PAGE 05  STATE  147692

NORMALLY TIGHTLY-DISCIPLINED CAPITAL&quot; WAS &quot;ALL TAKEN
SERIOUSLY.&quot;  MANY ANALYSTS FEEL THAT WHILE CENTRAL
AUTHORITIES REMAIN ANXIOUS FOR THOROUGH CAMPAIGN
TO RID COUNTRY OF REACTIONARY FORCES, THEY WANT IT
RUN WITHIN PRECISE AND CONTROLLABLE LIMITS.

8.  JOC'S LEWIN, IN RACINE WIS., REPORTS RECENT CONFERENCE
ON WOMEN IN PRC, HELD AT WINGSPREAD AND SPONSORED
BY NCUSCR, NATIONAL COALITION FOR RESEARCH ON WOMEN'S
EDUCATION AND DEVELOPMENT, AND THE JOHNSON FOUNDATION.
DR. HSIA, OF EVANSTON, ILL., DIRECTOR OF EDUCATIONAL
TESTING SERVICE, REPORTED THAT IN CHINA CREWS OF
TRAINS, PLANES AND HOSPITAL SURGERY TEAMS ARE LIKELY
ALL WOMEN.  THEY DO SAME WORK, AT SOME WAGES, AS MEN,
AND BELONG TO UNIONS.  JOHN W. LEWIS OF STANFORD

FROM 5-WEEK CHINA TRIP (GLOBE JULY 7), SAYS CRUX
OF DEBATE CONCERNS FUTURE PATTERN OF DEVELOPMENT.
WITH FUNDAMENTAL NEEDS SATISFIED, FOCUS IS NOW ON
NEXT STAGE - REAL INDUSTRIALIZATION, HOW TO EFFECT
IT AND AT WHAT COST.  CHOU'S POSITION IS INCIDENTAL,
EXCEPT TO EXTENT THAT HE SYMBOLIZES ONE FACTION.
ONE FACTION ADVOCATES LIMITED &quot;OPENING TO THE WEST,&quot;
TO SECURE ACCESS TO WESTERN INVESTMENT AND TECHNOLOGY;
ITS MEMBERS BELIEVE THAT LIMITED FOREIGN INVOLVEMENT
CAN BE CONTROLLED AND IS THEREFORE DESIRABLE AS A
MEANS TO SPEED ECON GROWTH.  THEIR ANTAGONISTS
ARE OFTEN MISTAKENLY CALLED &quot;LEFTISTS&quot;; &quot;FUNDAMENTALIST&quot;
IS BETTER TERM SINCE THEIR ASPIRATIONS ARE CLOSER
TO 19TH CENTURY POPULIST MOVEMENTS SUCH AS THE TAIPING
OR THE BOXERS, THAN TO MARX.  THEY ARE PROPONENTS
OF SELF-SUFFICIENCY AND INSIST THAT LOWER RATE OF
GROWTH IS PREFERABLE, AND THAT TO CALL FOR PROGRESS

THROUGH INVOLVEMENT WITH CAPITALISTS IS A SIREN CALL
TO DISASTER.

NOTES THAT IN RESPONSETO FOREIGN QUERIES ABOUT ANTI-
LIN/ANTI-CONFUCIUS MOVEMENT, CHINESE SAY THAT LIN
ADVOCATED A RETURN TO CAPITALISM, AND CONFUCIUS
REPRESENTED FEUDAL ORDER.  THEIR NAMES WERE SYMBOLIC;
THE MOVEMENT WAS DIRECTED AGAINST THOSE ELEMENTS
WHO STILL LONG FOR &quot;OLD WAYS.&quot;

IN THE WEST, HOWEVER, ATTENTION FOCUSED ON THE
PARALLELS BETWEEN CONFUCIUS AND CHOU, AS PRAGMATIC
TECHNOCRATS AND REFORMERS.  WESTERN OFFICIALS IN
PEKING TENDED TO BELIEVE THAT CHOU REMAINED IN
SECURE ADMIN CONTROL, AND THAT HE MIGHT EVEN BE
DIRECTING THE MOVEMENT.  WESTERN SPECIALISTS IN
HONG KONG WITH SOURCES FROM SOUTHERN AND CENTRAL
CHINA, HOWEVER, TENDED TO BE CONVINCED THAT ATTACKS
ON CONFUCIUS REPRESENTED INDIRECT ATTACKS ON CHOU.
JACOBSEN MAINTAINS BOTH INTERPRETATIONS CONTAINED
ELEMENTS OF TRUTH BUT SEES MOVEMENT'S ORIGINAL
PROTAGONISTS (&quot;FUNDAMENTALISTS&quot;) STRIVING TO
LAUNCH EVER-NEW VARIANTS TO THE CAMPAIGN, THEREBY
KEEPING AT LEAST PART OF &quot;CRITICIZE MOVEMENT&quot; OUT
OF CHOU'S CONTROL AND SECURING BASIS FROM WHICH
ITS LATER REVITALIZATION BECAME POSSIBLE.

JACOBSEN REPORTS THAT WUHAN POSTER ON MAY

THIS REFLECTED LOCAL ZEALOTS'WORK OR CENTRAL

DIRECTIVE.  BUT THIS WAS FOLLOWED BY POSTERSIN
CANTON AND PEKING CRITICIZING CHOU ASSOCIATES -

OR OTHER.

JACOBSEN CONTRASTS FERVOR OF PRO-SELF-SUFFICIENCY
AND ANTI-FOREIGNER SENTIMENT OF RURAL-ORIENTED
CENTRAL CHINA WITH PERFUNCTORY MANNER IN WHICH
SELF-SUFFICIENCY IS ESPOUSED DURING VISIT TO
TIENTSIN FACTORIES AND TIENTSIN POLYTECHNIC, WHERE
DESIRE FOR INCREASED ACCESS TO FOREIGN TECHNOLOGY
IS EVIDENT.  STRESSES THAT CCP HAS A RURAL BASE,
AND THAT ITS PRIMARY CLAIM TO LEGITIMACY RESTS
ON ITS RURAL CONCERNS.  ALSO EMPHASIZES THAT WHATEVER
THE OUTCOME OF CURRENT DEBATE, IT IS CONDUCTED
WITHIN THE PARTY, IS CONTROLLED BY THE PARTY, AND
IS NOT ANALOGOUS TO GPCR, WHEN MAO DIRECTED HIS
RED GUARDS TO &quot;STORM THE HEADQUARTERS&quot; OF A PARTY
WHICH HAD BEEN MANEUVERED OUT OF THE EFFECTIVE
ORGANS OF POWER.

NYDN TAKES JAUNDICED VIEW OF SENATOR JACKSON'S
LINE THAT PRC LEADERS ARE MEN WHO, UNLIKE THEIR
KREMLIN COUNTERPARTS, CAN BE COUNTED ON TO ABIDE
SCRUPULOUSLY BY ANY AGREEMENT THEY MAKE WITH US.

HE HAD NOT RAISED WITH CHINESE IDEA OF ESTABLISHING
FULL DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS WITH US, BUT BELIEVED

CHINA-WATCHERS, INFORMED OF JACKSON'S STATEMENT,
WERE SKEPTICAL THAT PRC WOULD EVER ACCEPT HIS

AS PRECONDITION TO ESTABLISHING DIPLOMATIC TIES

HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF PEOPLE WHO RELY ON THE PARTY
PRESS FOR ALL THEIR INFORMATION ON THE LEADERS,
(NCNA'S &quot;TUCKED-AWAY&quot; DISCLOSURE THAT CHOU MET
JACKSON &quot;IN A HOSPITAL&quot;) WOULD CAUSE DISTRESS SECOND
ONLY TO THE ACTUAL DEMISE&quot; OF CHOU OR MAO.  SAYS
FOR THIS REASON ALONE, DECISION TO GO PUBLIC WITH
PREMIER'S HOSPITALIZATION WAS EXTRAORDINARY.  ONLY
SENSIBLE CONCLUSION IS THAT CHOU WOULD HAVE LEFT
HOSPITAL TO MEET SENATOR IF HE HAD FELT UP TO IT;
THAT HE DID NOT, IS, ON FACE OF IT, SUREST INDICATION

ON WOMEN IN PRC, HELD AT WINGSPREAD AND SPONSORED
BY NCUSCR, NATIONAL COALITION FOR RESEARCH ON WOMEN'S

DR. HSIA, OF EVANSTON, ILL., DIRECTOR OF EDUCATIONAL
TESTING SERVICE, REPORTED THAT IN CHINA CREWS OF
TRAINS, PLANES AND HOSPITAL SURGERY TEAMS ARE LIKELY
ALL WOMEN.  THEY DO SAME WORK, AT SOME WAGES, AS MEN,
AND BELONG TO UNIONS.  JOHN W. LEWIS OF STANFORD
SAID MAO'S SUCCESSOR MAY BE CHIANG CHING INDIVIDUALLY,
OR AS DOMINANT FORCE OF A COLLECTIVE LEADERSHIP.
HE SAID MAO IS STRONG ADVOCATE OF INCREASING SINO-
US TRADE, AND CHIANG CHING WOULD ALSO SEE THAT THIS
TRADE CONTINUES.  CHICAGO U'S WM. PARISH SAID THAT
IN SMALL TEXTILE, FURNITURE AND ELECTRONICS FACTORIES
IN CHINESE COUNTRYSIDE 70 PERCENT OF WORKERS ARE
WOMEN, THOUGH NOT MANY ARE IN EXECUTIVE POSITIONS
BECAUSE THEY LACKED EDUCATION AND TRAINING BEFORE
1949.  DR. ROXANE WITKE OF HARVARD, WHO SPENT 65
HOURS IN INTERVIEWS WITH CHIANG CHING, REPORTED THAT
WHILE SHE &quot;REPRESENTS CULTURE IN CHINA IN AN IMPORTANT
WAY, SHE IS NOT A LEADER OF WOMEN.&quot;  CONFERENCE
LEARNED THAT IN FIRST QUARTER 1974, US EXPORTED
343.5 MILLION DOLS, MOSTLY WHEAT BUT SOME MANUFACTURED
GOODS, TO PRC; US IMPORTED 20.2 MILLION DOLS OF
CHINESE GOODS IN THOSE THREE MONTHS.

COMMENT AND ANALYSIS

CHINA

20.  HARVARD'S C. G. JACOBSEN, WHO RECENTLY RETURNED

FROM 5-WEEK CHINA TRIP (GLOBE JULY 7), SAYS CRUX
OF DEBATE CONCERNS FUTURE PATTERN OF DEVELOPMENT.
WITH FUNDAMENTAL NEEDS SATISFIED, FOCUS IS NOW ON
NEXT STAGE - REAL INDUSTRIALIZATION, HOW TO EFFECT
IT AND AT WHAT COST.  CHOU'S POSITION IS INCIDENTAL,
EXCEPT TO EXTENT THAT HE SYMBOLIZES ONE FACTION.
ONE FACTION ADVOCATES LIMITED &quot;OPENING TO THE WEST,&quot;
TO SECURE ACCESS TO WESTERN INVESTMENT AND TECHNOLOGY;
ITS MEMBERS BELIEVE THAT LIMITED FOREIGN INVOLVEMENT
CAN BE CONTROLLED AND IS THEREFORE DESIRABLE AS A
MEANS TO SPEED ECON GROWTH.  THEIR ANTAGONISTS
ARE OFTEN MISTAKENLY CALLED &quot;LEFTISTS&quot;; &quot;FUNDAMENTALIST&quot;
IS BETTER TERM SINCE THEIR ASPIRATIONS ARE CLOSER
TO 19TH CENTURY POPULIST MOVEMENTS SUCH AS THE TAIPING
OR THE BOXERS, THAN TO MARX.  THEY ARE PROPONENTS
OF SELF-SUFFICIENCY AND INSIST THAT LOWER RATE OF
GROWTH IS PREFERABLE, AND THAT TO CALL FOR PROGRESS
UNCLASSIFIED

UNCLASSIFIED

PAGE 10  STATE  147692

THROUGH INVOLVEMENT WITH CAPITALISTS IS A SIREN CALL
TO DISASTER.

NOTES THAT IN RESPONSETO FOREIGN QUERIES ABOUT ANTI-
LIN/ANTI-CONFUCIUS MOVEMENT, CHINESE SAY THAT LIN
ADVOCATED A RETURN TO CAPITALISM, AND CONFUCIUS
REPRESENTED FEUDAL ORDER.  THEIR NAMES WERE SYMBOLIC;
THE MOVEMENT WAS DIRECTED AGAINST THOSE ELEMENTS
WHO STILL LONG FOR &quot;OLD WAYS.&quot;

IN THE WEST, HOWEVER, ATTENTION FOCUSED ON THE
PARALLELS BETWEEN CONFUCIUS AND CHOU, AS PRAGMATIC
TECHNOCRATS AND REFORMERS.  WESTERN OFFICIALS IN
PEKING TENDED TO BELIEVE THAT CHOU REMAINED IN
SECURE ADMIN CONTROL, AND THAT HE MIGHT EVEN BE
DIRECTING THE MOVEMENT.  WESTERN SPECIALISTS IN
HONG KONG WITH SOURCES FROM SOUTHERN AND CENTRAL
CHINA, HOWEVER, TENDED TO BE CONVINCED THAT ATTACKS
ON CONFUCIUS REPRESENTED INDIRECT ATTACKS ON CHOU.
JACOBSEN MAINTAINS BOTH INTERPRETATIONS CONTAINED
ELEMENTS OF TRUTH BUT SEES MOVEMENT'S ORIGINAL
PROTAGONISTS (&quot;FUNDAMENTALISTS&quot;) STRIVING TO
LAUNCH EVER-NEW VARIANTS TO THE CAMPAIGN, THEREBY
KEEPING AT LEAST PART OF &quot;CRITICIZE MOVEMENT&quot; OUT
OF CHOU'S CONTROL AND SECURING BASIS FROM WHICH
ITS LATER REVITALIZATION BECAME POSSIBLE.

JACOBSEN REPORTS THAT WUHAN POSTER ON MAY
19 CRITICIZED CHOU BY NAME, ALTHOUGH UNCLEAR WHETHER
THIS REFLECTED LOCAL ZEALOTS'WORK OR CENTRAL

DIRECTIVE.  BUT THIS WAS FOLLOWED BY POSTERSIN
CANTON AND PEKING CRITICIZING CHOU ASSOCIATES -
IN LATTER CASE POLITBURO MEMBER HUA KUO-FENG.

JACOBSEN OBSERVES MAO &quot;STRADDLING TWO HORSES&quot; IN
DISPUTE AS IN  PAST, NOTING THAT POSTURE ACCORDS
WITH MAO'S THEORY OF THE DIALECTIC, AND STRUGGLE
THROUGH OPPOSITES.  THINKS DISPUTE WILL NOT BE
SETTLED UNTIL AND IF MAO DECIDES TO THROW HIS
INFLUENCE EXPLICITLY AND OPENLY BEHIND ONE SIDE

OR OTHER.

JACOBSEN CONTRASTS FERVOR OF PRO-SELF-SUFFICIENCY
AND ANTI-FOREIGNER SENTIMENT OF RURAL-ORIENTED
CENTRAL CHINA WITH PERFUNCTORY MANNER IN WHICH
SELF-SUFFICIENCY IS ESPOUSED DURING VISIT TO
TIENTSIN FACTORIES AND TIENTSIN POLYTECHNIC, WHERE
DESIRE FOR INCREASED ACCESS TO FOREIGN TECHNOLOGY
IS EVIDENT.  STRESSES THAT CCP HAS A RURAL BASE,
AND THAT ITS PRIMARY CLAIM TO LEGITIMACY RESTS
ON ITS RURAL CONCERNS.  ALSO EMPHASIZES THAT WHATEVER
THE OUTCOME OF CURRENT DEBATE, IT IS CONDUCTED
WITHIN THE PARTY, IS CONTROLLED BY THE PARTY, AND
IS NOT ANALOGOUS TO GPCR, WHEN MAO DIRECTED HIS
RED GUARDS TO &quot;STORM THE HEADQUARTERS&quot; OF A PARTY
WHICH HAD BEEN MANEUVERED OUT OF THE EFFECTIVE
ORGANS OF POWER.

NYDN TAKES JAUNDICED VIEW OF SENATOR JACKSON'S
LINE THAT PRC LEADERS ARE MEN WHO, UNLIKE THEIR
KREMLIN COUNTERPARTS, CAN BE COUNTED ON TO ABIDE
SCRUPULOUSLY BY ANY AGREEMENT THEY MAKE WITH US.
SAYS PEKING MERELY HASN'T HAD MUCH CHANCE TO MATCH
MOSCOW'S RECORD FOR TREATY-WELSHINGAND DOUBLE-
DEALING, AND WE SHOULD BE SLOW TO PUT TEMPTATION
IN ITS PATH.

INTERNAL AFFAIRS OF OTHER COUNTRIES AS BEING BEYOND

POLITICAL POWER - NOT TO THE FLOW OF HUMAN SYMPATHIES.

PEOPLE BEHIND SHIELD OF AMERICAN PROTECTION.

JAPAN

23. NYT SEES IN ELECTION RESULTS VOTER REBUFF
TO TANAKA FOR FAILURE TO CURB INFLATION.  VOTERS
ALSO PROVOKED BY LAVISH FINANCIAL SUPPORT PROVIDED
FOR LDP CANDIDATES BY BIG CORPORATIONS.  CONCERN
ABOUT ENVIRONMENTAL PROBLEMS, EXACERBATED BY RAPID
INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT, AND GOJ'S POTENTIAL THREAT
TO FREEDOM OF PRESS AND ASSEMBLY MAY ALSO HAVE
CONTRIBUTED TO TANAKA LOSSES.  ELECTION RESULTS
WILL JEOPARDIZE TANAKA'S PLANS TO RUN NEXT SPRING
FOR NEW 3-YEAR TERM AS PARTY PRES, AND THUS AS
PM.  CONCLUDES THAT THE JAPANESE HAVE DEMONSTRATED
THE HEALTH OF THEIR 27-YEAR-OLD DEMOCRATIC SYSTEM
WITH 73 PERCENT TURNOUT, A RECORD FOR UPPER HOUSE
ELECTIONS.

24.  S-N (JULY 8) CONSIDERS AS ACCEPTABLE COMPROMISE

NOT SO CRITICALLY SCARCE.  FIVE OF MOST DEPLETED

FUNDAMENTAL QUESTIONS BETWEEN REPS OF ISLANDERS

WILLIAMS SAID JCS AND DOD HAVE OFFICIALLY

BASE, &quot;INCLUDING AIR OPERATIONS AND FORWARD DEPLOYMENT
OF WAR MATERIAL AND WAR RESERVE.&quot;  ACCORDING WILLIAMS,
PRES. APPROVED MILITARY PLAN IN 1971 AND REAFFIRMED
IT IN 1972 FOLLOWING NSC REVIEW.  CONGRESS HAS
NOT YET AUTHORIZED EITHER TINIAN BASE OR COMMONWEALTH
STATUS FOR NORTHERN MARIANAS.  US HAS &quot;TENTATIVELY
AGREED&quot; TO PAY 13.5 MILLION DOLLARS YEARLY FOR
SEVEN YEARS PLUS 3 MILLION YEARLY IN FEDERAL SERVICES
TO SUPPORT DOMAIN WHICH HAS ABOUT 14,000 POPULATION.

WILLIAMS SAID HE HAD CONSULTED INFORMALLY
ON PLAN WITH KEY LEGISLATORS WHO &quot;LED ME TO BELIEVE
CONGRESS IS FAVORABLY DISPOSED AND ENCOURAGED ME
IN OUR EFFORTS.&quot;

TINIAN BASE AND US INSTALLATIONS ON GUAM ARE

PATTERN OF PERIODIC TERRORISM AND GOVT. COUNTER-
