		<h3>Tor</h3>
		<p><a href="https://www.torproject.org">Tor</a> is an encrypted anonymising network that makes it harder to intercept internet communications, or see where communications are coming from or going to.</p>
		<p>In order to use the WikiLeaks public submission system as detailed above you can download the Tor Browser Bundle, which is a Firefox-like browser available for Windows, Mac OS X and GNU/Linux and pre-configured to connect using the anonymising system Tor.</p>
		<h4>Tails</h4>
		<p>If you are at high risk and you have the capacity to do so, you can also access the submission system through a secure operating system called <a href="https://tails.boum.org">Tails</a>. Tails is an operating system launched from a USB stick or a DVD that aim to leaves no traces when the computer is shut down after use and automatically routes your internet traffic through Tor. Tails will require you to have either a USB stick or a DVD at least 4GB big and a laptop or desktop computer.</p>

		<h3>Tips</h3>
		<p>Our submission system works hard to preserve your anonymity, but we recommend you also take some of your own precautions. Please review these basic guidelines. </p>
		<div>
			<h4>1. Contact us if you have specific problems</h4>
			<p>If you have a very large submission, or a submission with a complex format, or are a high-risk source, please <a href="#submit_help_contact">contact us</a>. In our experience it is always possible to find a custom solution for even the most seemingly difficult situations.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h4>2. What computer to use</h4>
			<p>If the computer you are uploading from could subsequently be audited in an investigation, consider using a computer that is not easily tied to you. Technical users can also use <a href="https://tails.boum.org">Tails</a> to help ensure you do not leave any records of your submission on the computer.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h4>3. Do not talk about your submission to others</h4>
			<p>If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in source protection – it is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This includes other media organisations.</p>
		</div>

	</div>

		<h3>After</h3>

		<div>
			<h4>1. Do not talk about your submission to others</h4>
			<p>If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in source protection – it is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This includes other media organisations.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h4>2. Act normal</h4>
			<p>If you are a high-risk source, avoid saying anything or doing anything after submitting which might promote suspicion. In particular, you should try to stick to your normal routine and behaviour.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h4>3. Remove traces of your submission</h4>
			<p>If you are a high-risk source and the computer you prepared your submission on, or uploaded it from, could subsequently be audited in an investigation, we recommend that you format and dispose of the computer hard drive and any other storage media you used.</p>
			<p>In particular, hard drives retain data after formatting which may be visible to a digital forensics team and flash media (USB sticks, memory cards and SSD drives) retain data even after a secure erasure. If you used flash media to store sensitive data, it is important to destroy the media.</p>
			<p>If you do this and are a high-risk source you should make sure there are no traces of the clean-up, since such traces themselves may draw suspicion.</p>
			<div>
				<h4>4. If you face legal action</h4>
				<p>If a legal action is brought against you as a result of your submission, there are organisations that may help you. The Courage Foundation is an international organisation dedicated to the protection of journalistic sources. You can find more details at <a href="https://www.couragefound.org">https://www.couragefound.org</a>.</p>

		<p>WikiLeaks publishes documents of political or historical importance that are censored or otherwise suppressed. We specialise in strategic global publishing and large archives.</p>
		<p>The following is the address of our secure site where you can anonymously upload your documents to WikiLeaks editors. You can only access this submissions system through Tor. (See our <a href="#submit_help_tor">Tor tab</a> for more information.) We also advise you to read our <a href="#submit_help_tips">tips for sources</a> before submitting.</p>

			<!--<div>
				Copy this address into your Tor browser. Advanced users, if they wish, can also add a further layer of encryption to their submission using <a href="#submit_wlkey">our public PGP key</a>.
			</div>-->
		</div>

		<p>If you cannot use Tor, or your submission is very large, or you have specific requirements, WikiLeaks provides several alternative methods. <a href="#submit_help_contact">Contact us</a> to discuss how to proceed.</p>

DENG: WELCOME. IS THIS THE FIRST VISIT FOR MOST
OF THE DELEGATION MEMBERS?
STRAUSS: YES, THE FIRST FOR MOST OF MY COLLEAGUES AND
FOR MRS. STRAUSS AND ME. MANY OF MY COLLEAGUES HAD
THE HONOR AND PLEASURE TO SEE YOU IN WASHINGTON, D.C.,

RETURNING THE VISIT.
DENG: IS PRESIDENT CARTER WELL?
STRAUSS: YES. I WANT TO EXTEND ON BEHALF OF PRESIDENT
CARTER AND ROSALYNN CARTER -- WITH WHOM I HAD LUNCH LAST
WEEK -- THEIR WARM PERSONAL GREETINGS.
DENG: THANK YOU. PLEASE CONVEY TO PRESIDENT CARTER
AND MRS. CARTER MY RS AND THOSE OF MY WIFE. WE
HAVE FOND MEMORIES OF OUR STAY IN WASHINGTON, D.C.,
AND OUR TALKS WENT WELL.
STRAUSS: MR. VICE PREMIER, THE GROUP OF BUSINESSMEN
AND WOMEN ON THIS TRIP IS THE LARGEST BUSINESS MISSION
WHICH HAS EVER VISITED YOUR COUNTRY FROM OUR COUNTRY
SINCE NORMALIZATION AND REPRESENTS THE LEADERSHIP IN TECHNOLOGY,
AGRICULTURE, CONSTRUCTION, MOTION PICTURES, AND MANY
OTHER FIELDS. IT IS TRULY A BROAD CROSS-SECTION
OF OUR COUNTRY. THEY COME HERE NOT JUST TO FIND OUT
WHAT THEY CAN SELL, BUT ALSO WHAT THEY CAN BUY. I
AM PLEASED TO REPORT THAT WE WILL RETURN WITH MANY
IDEAS ON ITEMS OF INTEREST, FROM METALS TO JEWELRY -THEY RUN THE WHOLE RANGE OF PRODUCTS. NOT JUST U.S.
SELLING, BUT ALSO BUYING FROM CHINA.

DENG: YES, MY HOPE IS THAT YOU GET TO KNOW EACH
OTHER BETTER. THERE IS MUCH THAT REMAINS TO BE DONE
BETWEEN OUR TWO COUNTRIES IN THE POLITICAL FIELD,
TRADE, AND OTHER ECONOMIC RELATIONS. AS WE SAY IN
CHINA: &quot;THERE ARE MANY DAYS LYING IN FRONT OF US.&quot;
INDEED, WE DO NOT KNOW EACH OTHER VERY WELL AS YET.
FOR EXAMPLE, IN THE U.S., YOU ARE NOT VERY FAMILIAR
WITH THE ECONOMIC SITUATION IN CHINA AND THE MARKET
POSSIBILITIES IN CHINA, AND THIS HOLDS TRUE; VICE
VERSA, FOR US. ONE CAN SAY THAT IT IS NOT TO THE
MUTUAL ADVANTAGE OF BOTH SIDES IF WE DO NOT HAVE A
VERY DEVELOPED RELATIONSHIP. TRADE IS ALWAYS A BILATERAL AFFAIR. FOR OUR PART, WE NEED TO OPEN UP
NEW POSSIBILITIES FOR EXPORTS SO AS TO GAIN THE MEANS
AND CAPACITY OF REPAYMENT TO ABSORB ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY
OF OTHER COUNTRIES, INCLUDING YOUR COUNTRY. YOU
CAME HERE TO DISCUSS MAINLY TEXTILES. BESIDES
TEXTILES, YOU SHOULD SEE WHAT POSSIBILITIES ARE
AVAILABLE IN OTHER FIELDS. CHINA'S TRADE WITH THE
U.S. IS VERY UNBALANCED. CHINA HAS A BIG DEFICIT.
IN YOUR TRADE WITH JAPAN, IT IS THE OTHER WAY AROUND.

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
AS TO THE SPECIFIC QUESTION XTILES, THIS IS UP
TO YOU AND THE MINISTRY OF FOREIGN TRADE TO DISCUSS.
I DON'T HAVE TO SAY MUCH ON THIS ASPECT, I
SUGGEST THAT WE EXPAND THE SCOPE, WIDEN THE POSSIBILITIES IN OTHER FIELDS. ALL OF YOU ARE KNOWLEDGEABLE IN
YOUR RESPECT FIELDS -- ALL EXPERTS. YOU CAN FIND
OUT WHAT NEW PATHS CAN BE OPENED; I HOPE YOU CAN
MAKE YOUR SUGGESTIONS.

NO NEGOTIATION, WE HAVE A COMMON PROBLEM. I FULLY
APPRECIATE THE DIFFICULTIES YOU HAVE -- THE EXONOMIC
DIFFICULTIES. I TPE YOU UNDERSTAND OUR POLITICAL
DIFFICULTIES. I WAS WITH YOUR DISTINGUISHED MINISTER
OF FOREIGN TRADE LI QIANG LAST NIGHT AND WITH CHAIRMAN
WANG ON MANY OCCASIONS. WE HAVE A COMMON DIFFICULT
PROBLEM AND WE ARE WORKING HARD TO SOLVE IT. PRESIDENT
CARTER ASKED ME TO MAKE EVERY CONCEIVABLE EFFORT TO
RESOLVE THIS RPOBLEM. WITH REGARD TO THE BROADER
FIELDS THAN TEXTILES, I WELL REMEMBER OUR CONVERSATION
WHEN YOU AND MADAME DENG TRAVELED IN OUR COUNTRY. YOU
SAID YOU WANTED MODERN TECHNOLOGY, NOT OUTDATED

DENG: THEY CAN GET IN TOUCH WITH THEIR COUNTERPARTS
HERE. IF THEY ARE NOT SUCCESSFUL IN CONCLUDING DELAS
NOW, THERE WILL BE MORE TO DO IN THE FUTURE. ONE OF
OUR VICE PREMIERS, IN CHARGE OF ECONOMIC AFFAIRS, IS
CURRENTLY IN THE U.S. -- VICE PREMIER KANG SHIEN.
HE MET WITH PRESIDENT CARTER YESTERDAY. THER
FIELDS, MORE PEOPLE ON YOUR SIDE WILL BE COMING AND
MORE PEOPLE ON OUR SIDE WILL BE GOING. BUT IN EVERY
FIELD OF COOPERATION, THE GUIDING PRINCIPLE SHOULD
BE TO HELP INCREASE CHINA'S CAPACITY TO PAY. A
MODERATE AMOUT OF CREDIT IS GOOD. BUT IF IT IS TOO
MUCH, WE CANNOT PAY. (AT THIS POINT, THE BUSINESS
MEMBERS OF THE DELEGATION LEFT THE ROOM.)
DENG: I READ WHAT YOU TOLD THE CORRESPONDENTS. IT
HAS BEEN REPORTED ALREADY.
STRAUSS: WHAT DID I TELL THEM?
DENG: YOU SPOKE TOO STRONGLY|
STRAUSS: I DID NOT SPEAK THAT STRONGLY; THE CORRESPONDENTS DID.
DENG: IF IT IS THEIR WORDING, THAT IS ANOTHER MATTER.
ACCORDING TO THEIR REPORTS, YOU USED THE WORD
&quot;ULTIMATUM.&quot;
STRAUSSS: MR. VICE PREMIER, I HAVE NEVER USED THE WORD
&quot;ULTIMATUM&quot; IN MY LIFE. IF I USED IT, AND SOMEONE

THE LATER STORIES WERE CORRECT. IN ADDITION, THE
NEW YORK TIMES WOKE ME AT 5:00 A.M. TO SAY THAT ONE OF
THE REPORTS WAS CARRYING THE WORD &quot;ULTIMATUM,&quot; BUT

WE SUPPORTED PRESIDENT SADAT DESPITE THE FACT THAT MANY

PRINCIPLES: FIRST, A COMPREHENSIVE SETTLEMENT OF THE

RECOVERED. THIRD, THE RIGHTS OF THE PALESTINIANS
SHOULD BE RESTORED. BECAUSE PRESIDENT SADAT HAS INSISTED ON THESE THREE PRINCIPLES, EVEN THOUGH OTHER

OUR FULL SUPPORT. WE SUPPORT AN EGYPTIAN DIALOGUE
WITH ISRAEL. OUR CONSISTENT VIEW IS THAT ONE
CANNOT DENY THE FACT OF ISRAEL'S EXISTENCE. BECAUSE
ISRAEL CAME INTO EXISTENCE BY A UN RESOLUTION, ISRAEL
CANNOT BE DESTROYED FROM THE FACE OF THE WORLD. WE
HAVE MADE THIS QUITE CLEAR TO THE ARAB COUNTRIES AND
TO THE PLO. AFTER THE CONCLUSION OF THE EGYPTIANISRAELI TREATY, THE GREAT MAJORITY OF THE OTHER ARAB
COUNTRIES WERE OPPOSED. IN THIS REGARD, WE CAN SAY
THAT PRESIDENT SADAT MADE VERY BIG CONCESSIONS. SO HE

GREAT MAJORITY OF THE ARAB COUNTRIES HAVE GOOD

NOW. PRESIDENT CARTER HAS ASKED ME TO SERVE AS HIS
PERSONAL REPRESENTATIVE TO THE MIDDLE EAST TO TRY TO
HELP RESOLVE THE PROBLEM BECAUSE I HAVE EXPERIENCE, NOT
AS A DIPLOMAT (I HAVE NO DIPLOMATIC EXPERIENCE), BUT
AS A POLITICAL NEGOTIATOR AND THIS IS A POLITICAL
PROBLEM. TO BE SUCCESSFUL, THERE MUST BE MANY SMALL
EFFORTS; 1,000 LITTLE ACCOMPLISHMENTS. ANY ONE IS NOT
ENOUGH TO ACHIEVE THE OBJECTIVE, BUT ALTOGETHER THEY
WILL BE SUCCESSFUL. I WOULD NOT BE SO PRESUMPTIOUS
AS TO CONTINUE TO URGE THIS POINT, BUT I SUGGEST THAT
YOU STUDY THE POSSIBILITY OF ONE OF THE SMALL PIECES
WHICH WOULD NOT DISTURB YOUR RELATIONS WITH OTHER
NATIONS, BUT WOULD HELP THE PEACE PROSPECTS AND
ASSIST ISRAEL AND EGYPT; FOR EXAMPLE, BY INVITING ONE
IRRIGATION EXPERT FROM ISRAEL AND ONE FROM EGYPT TO
COME TO CHINA TO STUDY. OR PERHAPS IN SOME OTHER
FIELD -- TO DO SOMETHING TO CONTRIBUTE TO THIS PROCESS.

DENG: PERHAPS AFTER A CONSIDERABLE PERIOD OF TIME,
AFTER CHANGE IN THE MIDDLE EAST, PERHAPS SOMETHING
OF THIS SORT CAN BE CONSIDERED. BUT FOR A CERTAIN
PERIOD OF TIME, THIS IS NOT CONCEIVABLE. THIS IS NOT
A MINOR, SMALL STEP, BUT A BIG POLITICAL STEP. IT IS
NOT A MAOF IRRIGATION OR SOME OTHER FIELD, BUT A
BIG POLITICAL STEP. I AM VERY CERTAIN THAT IF WE
ALLOWED A FEW ISRAELI EXPERTS TO COME TO CHINA, WE
WOULD IMMEDIATELY LOSE 90 MILLION ARABS -- THIS IS NOT
A VERY COMPLEX QUESTION.
STRAUSS: I WOULD NEVER LET THAT HAPPEN. THANK YOU.
WE HAVE TAKEN TOO MUCH OF YOUR VERY VALUABLE TIME.
IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE YOU WANT TO SAY, OR THAT YOUR
COLLEAGUES WANT TO SAY? OTHERWISE WE WILL EXCUSE
OURSELVES.
DENG: NO, NOTHING FURTHER. DO THE OTHERS HAVE
ANYTHING?
STRAUSS: I WILL ONLY SAY THAT I WILL RETURN AND TRY

CARTER AND ROSALYNN CARTER -- WITH WHOM I HAD LUNCH LAST
WEEK -- THEIR WARM PERSONAL GREETINGS.
DENG: THANK YOU. PLEASE CONVEY TO PRESIDENT CARTER
AND MRS. CARTER MY RS AND THOSE OF MY WIFE. WE
HAVE FOND MEMORIES OF OUR STAY IN WASHINGTON, D.C.,
AND OUR TALKS WENT WELL.
STRAUSS: MR. VICE PREMIER, THE GROUP OF BUSINESSMEN
AND WOMEN ON THIS TRIP IS THE LARGEST BUSINESS MISSION
WHICH HAS EVER VISITED YOUR COUNTRY FROM OUR COUNTRY
SINCE NORMALIZATION AND REPRESENTS THE LEADERSHIP IN TECHNOLOGY,
AGRICULTURE, CONSTRUCTION, MOTION PICTURES, AND MANY
OTHER FIELDS. IT IS TRULY A BROAD CROSS-SECTION
OF OUR COUNTRY. THEY COME HERE NOT JUST TO FIND OUT
WHAT THEY CAN SELL, BUT ALSO WHAT THEY CAN BUY. I
AM PLEASED TO REPORT THAT WE WILL RETURN WITH MANY
IDEAS ON ITEMS OF INTEREST, FROM METALS TO JEWELRY -THEY RUN THE WHOLE RANGE OF PRODUCTS. NOT JUST U.S.
SELLING, BUT ALSO BUYING FROM CHINA.

DENG: YES, MY HOPE IS THAT YOU GET TO KNOW EACH
OTHER BETTER. THERE IS MUCH THAT REMAINS TO BE DONE
BETWEEN OUR TWO COUNTRIES IN THE POLITICAL FIELD,
TRADE, AND OTHER ECONOMIC RELATIONS. AS WE SAY IN
CHINA: &quot;THERE ARE MANY DAYS LYING IN FRONT OF US.&quot;
INDEED, WE DO NOT KNOW EACH OTHER VERY WELL AS YET.
FOR EXAMPLE, IN THE U.S., YOU ARE NOT VERY FAMILIAR
WITH THE ECONOMIC SITUATION IN CHINA AND THE MARKET
POSSIBILITIES IN CHINA, AND THIS HOLDS TRUE; VICE
VERSA, FOR US. ONE CAN SAY THAT IT IS NOT TO THE
MUTUAL ADVANTAGE OF BOTH SIDES IF WE DO NOT HAVE A
VERY DEVELOPED RELATIONSHIP. TRADE IS ALWAYS A BILATERAL AFFAIR. FOR OUR PART, WE NEED TO OPEN UP
NEW POSSIBILITIES FOR EXPORTS SO AS TO GAIN THE MEANS
AND CAPACITY OF REPAYMENT TO ABSORB ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY
OF OTHER COUNTRIES, INCLUDING YOUR COUNTRY. YOU
CAME HERE TO DISCUSS MAINLY TEXTILES. BESIDES
TEXTILES, YOU SHOULD SEE WHAT POSSIBILITIES ARE
AVAILABLE IN OTHER FIELDS. CHINA'S TRADE WITH THE
U.S. IS VERY UNBALANCED. CHINA HAS A BIG DEFICIT.
IN YOUR TRADE WITH JAPAN, IT IS THE OTHER WAY AROUND.

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
AS TO THE SPECIFIC QUESTION XTILES, THIS IS UP
TO YOU AND THE MINISTRY OF FOREIGN TRADE TO DISCUSS.
I DON'T HAVE TO SAY MUCH ON THIS ASPECT, I
SUGGEST THAT WE EXPAND THE SCOPE, WIDEN THE POSSIBILITIES IN OTHER FIELDS. ALL OF YOU ARE KNOWLEDGEABLE IN
YOUR RESPECT FIELDS -- ALL EXPERTS. YOU CAN FIND
OUT WHAT NEW PATHS CAN BE OPENED; I HOPE YOU CAN
MAKE YOUR SUGGESTIONS.

NOW. PRESIDENT CARTER HAS ASKED ME TO SERVE AS HIS
PERSONAL REPRESENTATIVE TO THE MIDDLE EAST TO TRY TO
HELP RESOLVE THE PROBLEM BECAUSE I HAVE EXPERIENCE, NOT
AS A DIPLOMAT (I HAVE NO DIPLOMATIC EXPERIENCE), BUT
AS A POLITICAL NEGOTIATOR AND THIS IS A POLITICAL
PROBLEM. TO BE SUCCESSFUL, THERE MUST BE MANY SMALL
EFFORTS; 1,000 LITTLE ACCOMPLISHMENTS. ANY ONE IS NOT
ENOUGH TO ACHIEVE THE OBJECTIVE, BUT ALTOGETHER THEY
WILL BE SUCCESSFUL. I WOULD NOT BE SO PRESUMPTIOUS
AS TO CONTINUE TO URGE THIS POINT, BUT I SUGGEST THAT
YOU STUDY THE POSSIBILITY OF ONE OF THE SMALL PIECES
WHICH WOULD NOT DISTURB YOUR RELATIONS WITH OTHER
NATIONS, BUT WOULD HELP THE PEACE PROSPECTS AND
ASSIST ISRAEL AND EGYPT; FOR EXAMPLE, BY INVITING ONE
IRRIGATION EXPERT FROM ISRAEL AND ONE FROM EGYPT TO
COME TO CHINA TO STUDY. OR PERHAPS IN SOME OTHER
FIELD -- TO DO SOMETHING TO CONTRIBUTE TO THIS PROCESS.
I WILL BE IN CLOSE TOUCH WITH AMBASSADOR CHAI AND I
LOOK FORWARD TO DISCUSSING THIS PROBLEM AT SOME APPROPRICONFIDENTIAL

ATE TIME.
DENG: PERHAPS AFTER A CONSIDERABLE PERIOD OF TIME,
AFTER CHANGE IN THE MIDDLE EAST, PERHAPS SOMETHING
OF THIS SORT CAN BE CONSIDERED. BUT FOR A CERTAIN
PERIOD OF TIME, THIS IS NOT CONCEIVABLE. THIS IS NOT
A MINOR, SMALL STEP, BUT A BIG POLITICAL STEP. IT IS
NOT A MAOF IRRIGATION OR SOME OTHER FIELD, BUT A
BIG POLITICAL STEP. I AM VERY CERTAIN THAT IF WE
ALLOWED A FEW ISRAELI EXPERTS TO COME TO CHINA, WE
WOULD IMMEDIATELY LOSE 90 MILLION ARABS -- THIS IS NOT
A VERY COMPLEX QUESTION.
STRAUSS: I WOULD NEVER LET THAT HAPPEN. THANK YOU.
WE HAVE TAKEN TOO MUCH OF YOUR VERY VALUABLE TIME.
IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE YOU WANT TO SAY, OR THAT YOUR
COLLEAGUES WANT TO SAY? OTHERWISE WE WILL EXCUSE
OURSELVES.
DENG: NO, NOTHING FURTHER. DO THE OTHERS HAVE
ANYTHING?
STRAUSS: I WILL ONLY SAY THAT I WILL RETURN AND TRY
TO CONCLUDE THE TEXTILE BUSINESS WITH YOUR DISTINGUISHED
COLLEAGUES. I HOPE THAT BEFORE WE LEAVE WE WILL
ACHIEVE SUCCESS WITH WHICH WE WILL EACH BE PROUD.
DENG: FINE.
