		<h3>Tor</h3>
		<p><a href="https://www.torproject.org">Tor</a> is an encrypted anonymising network that makes it harder to intercept internet communications, or see where communications are coming from or going to.</p>
		<p>In order to use the WikiLeaks public submission system as detailed above you can download the Tor Browser Bundle, which is a Firefox-like browser available for Windows, Mac OS X and GNU/Linux and pre-configured to connect using the anonymising system Tor.</p>
		<h4>Tails</h4>
		<p>If you are at high risk and you have the capacity to do so, you can also access the submission system through a secure operating system called <a href="https://tails.boum.org">Tails</a>. Tails is an operating system launched from a USB stick or a DVD that aim to leaves no traces when the computer is shut down after use and automatically routes your internet traffic through Tor. Tails will require you to have either a USB stick or a DVD at least 4GB big and a laptop or desktop computer.</p>

		<h3>Tips</h3>
		<p>Our submission system works hard to preserve your anonymity, but we recommend you also take some of your own precautions. Please review these basic guidelines. </p>
		<div>
			<h4>1. Contact us if you have specific problems</h4>
			<p>If you have a very large submission, or a submission with a complex format, or are a high-risk source, please <a href="#submit_help_contact">contact us</a>. In our experience it is always possible to find a custom solution for even the most seemingly difficult situations.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h4>2. What computer to use</h4>
			<p>If the computer you are uploading from could subsequently be audited in an investigation, consider using a computer that is not easily tied to you. Technical users can also use <a href="https://tails.boum.org">Tails</a> to help ensure you do not leave any records of your submission on the computer.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h4>3. Do not talk about your submission to others</h4>
			<p>If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in source protection – it is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This includes other media organisations.</p>
		</div>

	</div>
</div>

<div id="submit_help_after" class="submit_elem">

			</div>
		</div>

		<h3>After</h3>

		<div>
			<h4>1. Do not talk about your submission to others</h4>
			<p>If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in source protection – it is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This includes other media organisations.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h4>2. Act normal</h4>
			<p>If you are a high-risk source, avoid saying anything or doing anything after submitting which might promote suspicion. In particular, you should try to stick to your normal routine and behaviour.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h4>3. Remove traces of your submission</h4>
			<p>If you are a high-risk source and the computer you prepared your submission on, or uploaded it from, could subsequently be audited in an investigation, we recommend that you format and dispose of the computer hard drive and any other storage media you used.</p>
			<p>In particular, hard drives retain data after formatting which may be visible to a digital forensics team and flash media (USB sticks, memory cards and SSD drives) retain data even after a secure erasure. If you used flash media to store sensitive data, it is important to destroy the media.</p>
			<p>If you do this and are a high-risk source you should make sure there are no traces of the clean-up, since such traces themselves may draw suspicion.</p>
			<div>
				<h4>4. If you face legal action</h4>
				<p>If a legal action is brought against you as a result of your submission, there are organisations that may help you. The Courage Foundation is an international organisation dedicated to the protection of journalistic sources. You can find more details at <a href="https://www.couragefound.org">https://www.couragefound.org</a>.</p>

		<p>WikiLeaks publishes documents of political or historical importance that are censored or otherwise suppressed. We specialise in strategic global publishing and large archives.</p>
		<p>The following is the address of our secure site where you can anonymously upload your documents to WikiLeaks editors. You can only access this submissions system through Tor. (See our <a href="#submit_help_tor">Tor tab</a> for more information.) We also advise you to read our <a href="#submit_help_tips">tips for sources</a> before submitting.</p>

<br />
   BEIJING, July 11 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government Monday published a<br />
   white paper on the development of Tibet since 1951 to mark the 60th<br />
   anniversary of the peaceful liberation of the region.<br />
<br />
   The document, released by the State Council's Information Office, reviewed<br />
   the history of Tibet, particularly the liberation in 1951, as well as<br />
   profound political, social and economic changes that have taken place in<br />
   Tibet over the past 60 years.<br />
<br />
   &quot;Within six decades Tibet has achieved development that would normally<br />
   call for a millennium. Under the leadership of the Communist Party of<br />
   China and the Chinese government, the people of Tibet have created a<br />
   miracle,&quot; it reads.<br />
<br />
   &quot;Only by adhering to the leadership of the CPC, the path of socialism, the<br />
   system of regional ethnic autonomy, and the development mode with Chinese<br />
   characteristics and Tibet's regional features, can Tibet enjoy lasting<br />
   prosperity and a bright future,&quot; it adds.<br />
<br />
   While stressing Tibet has been an inseparable part of China since ancient<br />
   times, the white paper says the so-called &quot;Tibetan independence&quot; is in<br />
   fact &quot;cooked up by old and new imperialists,&quot; and &quot;was part of Western<br />
   aggressors' scheme to carve up the territory of China.&quot;<br />
<br />
   In the 60 years since its peaceful liberation in 1951, Tibet has fulfilled<br />
   two historic leaps &quot;from a society of feudal serfdom to one of socialism,<br />
   and from a state of isolation, poverty and backwardness to one of opening,<br />
   prosperity and civilization,&quot; it says.<br />

   Signing of 17-Article Agreement symbolizes peaceful liberation of Tibet:   <br />
   white paper                                                                <br />

<br />
   BEIJING, July 11 (Xinhua) -- The signing of the 17-Article Agreement<br />
   symbolized the peaceful liberation of Tibet, thus &quot;opening a new page in<br />
   the history of social progress in Tibet,&quot; said a white paper released on<br />
   Monday.<br />
<br />
   The peaceful liberation enabled Tibet to &quot;shake off imperialist aggression<br />
   and political and economic fetters,&quot; safeguarded China's sovereignty,<br />
   unity and territorial integrity and enhanced the solidarity among all<br />
   ethnic groups of China and within Tibet, said the white paper, &quot;Sixty<br />
   Years Since Peaceful Liberation of Tibet,&quot; released by the State Council<br />
   Information Office.<br />
<br />
   It said &quot;after friendly talks,&quot; the Central People's Government of China<br />
   and the local government of Tibet signed the Agreement on Measures for the<br />
   Peaceful Liberation of Tibet in Beijing on May 23, 1951.<br />
<br />
   The central government and Chairman Mao Zedong had never given up their<br />
   efforts for the peaceful liberation of Tibet. Even during the Qamdo<br />
   Battle, Mao urged that &quot;the Tibetan delegation should come to Beijing as<br />
   soon as possible,&quot; it said.<br />
<br />
   Regarding the peace talks and the signing of the 17-Article Agreement, the<br />
   white paper stressed some basic historical facts as follows:<br />
<br />
   -- The peace talks were held on the premise that the local government of<br />
   Tibet admitted that Tibet is an inseparable part of China.<br />
<br />
   -- The central government's &quot;ten policies&quot; for the peaceful liberation of<br />
   Tibet were the basis for the talks.<br />
<br />
   The &quot;ten policies&quot; were: British and U.S. imperialist aggressive forces<br />
   shall be driven out of Tibet; regional ethnic autonomy shall be exercised<br />
   in Tibet; the present political system in Tibet shall remain unchanged;<br />
   freedom of religious belief shall be guaranteed; economy, culture and<br />
   education in Tibet shall be developed; matters of reform in Tibet shall be<br />
   settled by the Tibetan people and Tibetan leaders through consultation;<br />
   and the PLA troops shall enter Tibet.<br />
<br />
   -- The conflict between the Dalai Lama and Panchen Erdeni was an important<br />
   problem that had to be resolved in the talks.<br />
<br />
   -- The Agreement was reached on the basis of mutual respect and friendly<br />
   negotiations.<br />
<br />
   -- The Agreement gained support from the Dalai Lama and both<br />
   ecclesiastical and secular people in Tibet.<br />

   Life expectancy in Tibet nearly doubled over last six decades: white paper <br />
<br />
   English.news.cn   2011-07-11 18:11:31 [IMG]FeedbackPrint[IMG]RSS[IMG][IMG] <br />
<br />
   BEIJING, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Thanks to improvement in medical services<br />
   over the past six decades, average life expectancy in Tibet jumped from<br />
   35.5 to 67 years by the end of 2010, says a white paper issued by the<br />
   Chinese government on Monday.<br />
<br />
   The death rate of women in childbirth dropped from 5,000 per 100,000 to<br />
   174.78 per 100,000, and the infant mortality rate from 430 per thousand to<br />
   20.69 per thousand, according to the white paper titled &quot;Sixty Years Since<br />
   Peaceful Liberation of Tibet&quot;, issued by the Information Office of the<br />
   State Council.<br />
<br />
   It says that before the peaceful liberation in 1951, there were only three<br />
   small, shabby government-run institutions of Tibetan medicine and a small<br />
   number of private clinics, with less than 100 medical workers altogether.<br />
<br />
   But by the end of 2010 there were 1,352 medical institutions of all types<br />
   and at all levels in Tibet, with 8,838 hospital beds and 9,983 medical<br />
   workers, according to the white paper.<br />
<br />
   Population in Tibet tripled to 3 million since 1951, with ethnic Tibetans<br />
   accounting for 90.48 percent, according to China's sixth national census.<br />
<br />
   Improvement has also been seen in education.<br />
<br />
   The enrollment rate for school-age children was less than 2 percent and<br />
   illiteracy rate was as high as 95 percent among the young and the<br />
   middle-aged in 1951, the document says.<br />
<br />
   Sixty years later, the enrollment rate for primary school-age children of<br />
   the Tibetan ethnic group has reached 99.2 percent and the illiteracy rate<br />
   among the young and the middle-aged has fallen to 1.2 percent, according<br />
   to the white paper.<br />

<br />
   BEIJING, July 11 (Xinhua) -- No country or government in the world has<br />
   ever acknowledged the independence of Tibet, said a white paper released<br />
   on Monday.<br />
<br />
   &quot;China is a unified, multi-ethnic country, and the Tibetan people are<br />
   important members of the family of the Chinese nation,&quot; said the white<br />
   paper, &quot;Sixty Years Since Peaceful Liberation of Tibet,&quot; released by the<br />
   State Council Information Office.<br />
<br />
   Historical facts clearly demonstrate that the so-called &quot;Tibetan<br />
   independence&quot; was in fact cooked up by old and new imperialists, and was<br />
   part of Western aggressors' scheme to carve up the territory of China, the<br />
   white paper said.<br />
<br />
   Archaeological and academic research findings show that since ancient<br />
   times the Tibetan people have been &quot;closely connected with the Han and<br />
   other ethnic groups in blood relationship, language, culture and other<br />
   aspects,&quot; and economic, political and cultural exchanges between Tibet and<br />
   inland China &quot;have never been broken off,&quot; it said.<br />
<br />
   China's territory and history were created by the Chinese nation; the<br />
   Tibetan group, as one of the centuries-old ethnic groups in China, has<br />
   made important contributions to the creation and development of this<br />
   unified, multi-ethnic country and to the formation and evolvement of the<br />
   Chinese nation, it said.<br />
<br />
   In the 13th century the central government of the Yuan Dynasty (1271-1368)<br />
   formally incorporated Tibet into the central administration by setting up<br />
   the Supreme Control Commission and Commission for Buddhist and Tibetan<br />
   Affairs to directly administer the military and political affairs of the<br />
   Tibet region.<br />
<br />
   Following this, the Yuan central government gradually standardized and<br />
   institutionalized the administration of Tibet, which was also followed by<br />
   the Ming (1368-1644) government, it said.<br />
<br />
   The Qing Dynasty (1644-1911) strengthened the central government's<br />
   administration of Tibet.<br />
<br />
   In 1653 and 1713 the Qing emperors granted honorific titles to the 5th<br />
   Dalai Lama and the 5th Panchen Lama, officially establishing the titles of<br />
   the Dalai Lama and Panchen Erdeni, and their political and religious<br />
   status in Tibet.<br />
<br />
   In 1751 the Qing government abolished the system under which the various<br />
   commandery princes held power, and formally appointed the 7th Dalai Lama<br />
   to administer the local government of Tibet, and set up the Kashag<br />
   (cabinet) composed of four Kalons (ministers).<br />
<br />
   In 1793, the Qing government ordered that the reincarnation of Dalai Lama<br />
   and other Living Buddhas had to follow the procedure of &quot;drawing lots from<br />
   the golden urn,&quot; and the selected candidate would be subject to the<br />
   approval by the central authorities of China.<br />
<br />
   In the Qing Dynasty five Dalai Lamas were selected in this way, but two<br />
   did not go through the lot-drawing procedure as approved by the Qing<br />
   emperors, the white paper said.<br />
<br />
   The Revolution of 1911 toppled the Qing empire, and the Republic of China<br />
   (1912-1949) was founded. On March 11, 1912, the Republic of China issued<br />
   its first constitution, which clarified the central government's<br />
   sovereignty over Tibet.<br />
<br />
   It clearly stipulated that Tibet was a part of the territory of the<br />
   Republic of China, and stated that &quot;the Han, Manchu, Mongol, Hui and<br />
   Tibetan peoples are of one, and the five ethnic groups will be of one<br />
   republic.&quot;<br />
<br />
   The white paper said, &quot;the central government of the Republic of China<br />
   safeguarded the nation's sovereignty over Tibet in spite of frequent civil<br />
   wars among warlords in the interior.&quot;<br />
<br />
   The 14th Dalai Lama, Dainzin Gyatso, succeeded to the title with the<br />
   approval of the national government, which waived the lot-drawing<br />
   convention, it said. <br />

   Basically no pollution of water, atmosphere in Tibet: white paper          <br />
<br />
   English.news.cn   2011-07-11 17:58:39 [IMG]FeedbackPrint[IMG]RSS[IMG][IMG] <br />
<br />
   BEIJING, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Latest environment reports show that there is<br />
   basically no pollution of water or atmosphere in Tibet, says a white paper<br />
   issued on Monday.<br />
<br />
   Tibet has basically maintained its original natural state and is globally<br />
   one of the areas with the best environmental quality, says the white paper<br />
   titled &quot;Sixty Years Since Peaceful Liberation of Tibet&quot;, which was issued<br />
   by the Information Office of the State Council.<br />
<br />
   The paper says that ecological conservation has been progressing rapidly<br />
   and environmental protection is being strengthened in an all-round way in<br />
   Tibet.<br />
<br />
   Since its peaceful liberation in 1951, and especially since the adoption<br />
   of the reform and opening-up policies in late 1970s', the central and<br />
   regional governments have attached great importance to ecological<br />
   conservation and environmental protection in Tibet.<br />
<br />
   For instance, the forest coverage rate has risen from less than 1 percent<br />
   before the peaceful liberation to 11.91 percent at present, and more than<br />
   6 million hectares of wetland have been protected, according to the white<br />
   paper. <br />

   Religious freedom respected, protected in Tibet: white paper               <br />
<br />
   English.news.cn   2011-07-11 18:41:07 [IMG]FeedbackPrint[IMG]RSS[IMG][IMG] <br />
<br />
   BEIJING, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Freedom of religious belief of all ethnic<br />
   groups in Tibet is respected and protected, says the white paper &quot;Sixty<br />
   Years Since Peaceful Liberation of Tibet&quot; which was issued Monday by the<br />
   Information Office of the State Council.<br />
<br />
   It says that all religions and religious sects are equal in Tibet.<br />
<br />
   On Tibet's dominant religion, Tibetan Buddhism, the paper says that the<br />
   Living Buddha reincarnation system, unique to Tibetan Buddhism, is fully<br />
   respected.<br />
<br />
   Moreover, people are free to learn and debate Buddhist doctrines, get<br />
   ordained as monks and practice Buddhist rites, it says.<br />
<br />
   The central government has listed some famous religious sites as cultural<br />
   relics units that are under government protection, including the Potala<br />
   Palace, Jokhang Monastery, and Tashilhunpo, Drepung, Sera and Sakya<br />
   monasteries, it says.<br />
<br />
   Tibet now has more than 1,700 venues for religious activities, and about<br />
   46,000 monks and nuns, while more than one million worshipers make<br />
   pilgrimage to Lhasa each year, according to the white paper.<br />
<br />
   At the same time, ethnic culture in Tibet is enjoying unprecedented<br />
   prosperity, the paper says, adding that the central and regional<br />
   governments always attach great importance to carrying on, protecting and<br />
   developing Tibetan culture.<br />
<br />
   The study, use and development of the Tibetan language are protected by<br />
   law, and the Tibetan script has become the first ethnic-minority script in<br />
   China that has international text coding standards for information<br />
   exchange, it says.<br />
<br />
   The government has altogether apportioned 1.45 billion yuan (224 million<br />
   U.S. dollars) to maintain and repair the Potala Palace, the Norbulingka<br />
   and Sakya Monastery, and other cultural relics and historical sites,<br />
   according to the document.<br />
