		<h3>Tor</h3>
		<p><a href="https://www.torproject.org">Tor</a> is an encrypted anonymising network that makes it harder to intercept internet communications, or see where communications are coming from or going to.</p>
		<p>In order to use the WikiLeaks public submission system as detailed above you can download the Tor Browser Bundle, which is a Firefox-like browser available for Windows, Mac OS X and GNU/Linux and pre-configured to connect using the anonymising system Tor.</p>
		<h4>Tails</h4>
		<p>If you are at high risk and you have the capacity to do so, you can also access the submission system through a secure operating system called <a href="https://tails.boum.org">Tails</a>. Tails is an operating system launched from a USB stick or a DVD that aim to leaves no traces when the computer is shut down after use and automatically routes your internet traffic through Tor. Tails will require you to have either a USB stick or a DVD at least 4GB big and a laptop or desktop computer.</p>

		<h3>Tips</h3>
		<p>Our submission system works hard to preserve your anonymity, but we recommend you also take some of your own precautions. Please review these basic guidelines. </p>
		<div>
			<h4>1. Contact us if you have specific problems</h4>
			<p>If you have a very large submission, or a submission with a complex format, or are a high-risk source, please <a href="#submit_help_contact">contact us</a>. In our experience it is always possible to find a custom solution for even the most seemingly difficult situations.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h4>2. What computer to use</h4>
			<p>If the computer you are uploading from could subsequently be audited in an investigation, consider using a computer that is not easily tied to you. Technical users can also use <a href="https://tails.boum.org">Tails</a> to help ensure you do not leave any records of your submission on the computer.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h4>3. Do not talk about your submission to others</h4>
			<p>If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in source protection – it is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This includes other media organisations.</p>
		</div>

	</div>

		<h3>After</h3>

		<div>
			<h4>1. Do not talk about your submission to others</h4>
			<p>If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in source protection – it is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This includes other media organisations.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h4>2. Act normal</h4>
			<p>If you are a high-risk source, avoid saying anything or doing anything after submitting which might promote suspicion. In particular, you should try to stick to your normal routine and behaviour.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h4>3. Remove traces of your submission</h4>
			<p>If you are a high-risk source and the computer you prepared your submission on, or uploaded it from, could subsequently be audited in an investigation, we recommend that you format and dispose of the computer hard drive and any other storage media you used.</p>
			<p>In particular, hard drives retain data after formatting which may be visible to a digital forensics team and flash media (USB sticks, memory cards and SSD drives) retain data even after a secure erasure. If you used flash media to store sensitive data, it is important to destroy the media.</p>
			<p>If you do this and are a high-risk source you should make sure there are no traces of the clean-up, since such traces themselves may draw suspicion.</p>
			<div>
				<h4>4. If you face legal action</h4>
				<p>If a legal action is brought against you as a result of your submission, there are organisations that may help you. The Courage Foundation is an international organisation dedicated to the protection of journalistic sources. You can find more details at <a href="https://www.couragefound.org">https://www.couragefound.org</a>.</p>

		<p>WikiLeaks publishes documents of political or historical importance that are censored or otherwise suppressed. We specialise in strategic global publishing and large archives.</p>
		<p>The following is the address of our secure site where you can anonymously upload your documents to WikiLeaks editors. You can only access this submissions system through Tor. (See our <a href="#submit_help_tor">Tor tab</a> for more information.) We also advise you to read our <a href="#submit_help_tips">tips for sources</a> before submitting.</p>

			<!--<div>
				Copy this address into your Tor browser. Advanced users, if they wish, can also add a further layer of encryption to their submission using <a href="#submit_wlkey">our public PGP key</a>.
			</div>-->
		</div>

		<p>If you cannot use Tor, or your submission is very large, or you have specific requirements, WikiLeaks provides several alternative methods. <a href="#submit_help_contact">Contact us</a> to discuss how to proceed.</p>

SUBJECT:  CHINA AFTER MAO</div><div class="text-button" id="showhide">Show&nbsp;Headers</div><div class="text-content"><div id="tagged-text">WARNING NOTICE-SENSITIVE INTELLIGENCE SOURCES AND METHODS
INVOLVED - NOT RELEASABLE TO FOREIGN NATIONALS/NOT RELEAS-
ABLE TO CONTRACTORS OR CONTRACTOR-CONSULTANTS

1.  FOLLOWING IS TEXT OF INR REPORT NO. 586, &quot;CHINA AFTER
MAO--SHORT TERM PROSPECTS,&quot; DATED SEPTEMBER 13, 1976.  HARD
COPIES FOLLOW BY POUCH.

2.  BEGIN SUMMARY: MAO LEFT NO INSTITUTIONALIZED MEANS FOR
HIS OWN SUCCESSION, AND CONSEQUENTLY COALITION-BUILDING IS
LIKELY TO BE THE ORDER OF THE DAY.  AVAILABLE EVIDENCE
SUGGESTS THAT A ROUGH BALANCE STILL SEEMS TO EXIST AMONG
THE VARIOUS CONTENDING FACTIONS IN THE POLITBURO.  IN THE
IMMEDIATE FUTURE, THESE CONTENDING FORCES CAN BE EXPECTED
TO PRESENT AT LEAST A FACADE OF HARMONY AND ORDER, ALTHOUGH
THE POSSIBILITY OF A RELATIVELY OPEN POWER STRUGGLE, SUCH
AS DEVELOPED WHEN TENG WAS REMOVED AFTER CHOU'S DEATH, CAN
NOT BE RULED OUT COMPLETELY.

3.  THE MOST LIKELY LEADERSHIP ALIGNMENT IN THE NEAR TERM
IS A COLLEGIAL ONE LED BY INDIVIDUALS ACCEPTABLE TO MAJOR
FACTIONS AND INSTITUTIONS.  IT IS DOUBTFUL THAT SUCH A
COALITION WOULD UNDERTAKE ANY SIGNIFICANT POLICY CHANGES.
ALTHOUGH A LEFT-LEANING AND A MODERATE-LEANING COALITION
ARE ALSO POSSIBILITIES, CURRENT DIVISIONS ARE SUCH AS TO
MILITATE AGAINST ANY ONE FACTION'S ACHIEVING DOMINANCE.

SECRET

PAGE 03        STATE  228857

4.  POLITICAL MANEUVERING WILL CONTINUE TO REVOLVE PRIMARI-
LY AROUND DOMESTIC ISSUES.  THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THAT
FOREIGN POLICY HAS BEEN CENTRAL TO THE LEADERSHIP STRUGGLE,
AND ALL SIGNS POINT TO GENERAL AGREEMENT WITHIN THE LEADER-
SHIP ON THE CURRENT STRATEGY OF ANTI-SOVIETISM AND IMPROVED
RELATIONS WITH THE WEST.  FOREIGN POLICY WILL PROBABLY
CONTINUE WITHOUT MAJOR CHANGES IN THE NEAR FUTURE.

5.  THERE ARE DIFFERENCES IN EMPHASIS, HOWEVER.  THE LEFT
FEELS PARTICULARLY STRONGLY ABOUT ISSUES INVOLVING NATIONAL
TERRITORY AND SOVEREIGNTY, AND A LEFT-LEANING COALITION
WOULD BE MORE INCLINED THAN WOULD EITHER A MODERATE OR A
COLLEGIAL ONE TO PRESS THE US HARD TO BREAK ITS TIES WITH
TAIWAN.  FURTHERMORE, A LEFTIST COALITION PROBABLY WOULD BE
THE LEAST LIKELY OF THE THREE TO MAKE A POSITIVE RESPONSE
TO REITERATED SOVIET OFFERS TO IMPROVE RELATIONS, WHICH ARE
LIKELY TO FOLLOW MAO'S DEATH.  END SUMMARY.

6.  BEGIN TEXT.  THE DEATH OF MAO, THOUGH LONG ANTICIPATED,
HAS REMOVED A MAJOR INTEGRATIVE FORCE FROM THE CHINESE
POLITICAL SCENE.  HE LEFT NO INSTITUTIONALIZED MEANS FOR
HIS OWN SUCCESSION, AND THE PRC TODAY HAS NO LEADER WITH
THE PRESTIGE AND AUTHORITY THAT HE OR CHOU EN-LAI HAD.

7.  PROCEDURALLY, A NEW CHAIRMAN SHOULD BE CHOSEN BY A
PLENARY MEETING OF THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE, OR ALTERNATIVELY,
BY THE POLITBURO ITSELF.  SO FAR, HOWEVER, THERE ARE NO
INDICATIONS THAT AN EFFORT WILL BE MADE IN THE IMMEDIATE
FUTURE TO CHOOSE A NEW CHAIRMAN.

8.  IN ANY EVENT, THE ABSENCE OF EITHER A DESIGNATED OR AN
OBVIOUS SUCCESSOR TO MAO SUGGESTS THAT:

(A)--NO PLAN FOR THE SUCCESSION THAT MAY HAVE BEEN WORKED
OUT IN RECENT MONTHS WILL BE INVIOLABLE, EVEN IF MAO
GAVE IT HIS BLESSING.

(B)--LEADERSHIP COMPETITION WILL NOT FOCUS ON ATTEMPTING
TO FIND AN INDIVIDUAL TO FILL MAO'S DISTINCTIVE ROLE

AS POLICY INITIATOR OR ARBITRATOR BUT RATHER ON DECIDING
SECRET

PAGE 04        STATE  228857

HOW TO DIVIDE THE POLICY DOMAIN AND FIND AN ALTERNATIVE
MEANS OF RESOLVING LEADERSHIP DISPUTES.

(C)--THE LEADERSHIP MIGHT EVEN RETIRE THE TITLE OF &quot;CHAIR-
MAN&quot; AND EXPAND OR ESTABLISH SEVERAL POSITIONS WHICH WILL
INCLUDE PARTS OF MAO'S PREVIOUS POWERS.

(D)--COALITION-BUILDING IS LIKELY TO BE THE ORDER OF THE
DAY, AND THE PRIMARY ARENA FOR THIS ACTIVITY WILL BE THE
POLITBURO.  NEVERTHELESS, BECAUSE THE CULTURAL REVOLU-
TION LEGITIMIZED APPEALS TO GROUPS AND INSTITUTIONS
OUTSIDE THE PARTY, A FACTION OUTGUNNED IN THE PRIMARY
ARENA MAY TRY TO MOBILIZE MASS ORGANIZATIONS AND DIS-
GRUNTLED LOWER-LEVEL CADRE IN ITS BID FOR POWER.

9.  CURRENT POWER ALIGNMENTS:

10.  THE SUCCESSION STRUGGLE HAS BEEN UNDER WAY IN EARNEST
AT LEAST SINCE CHOU'S DEATH WITHOUT ANY FACTION HAVING
GAINED THE UPPER HAND.  A ROUGH BALANCE STILL SEEMS TO
EXIST AMONG THE VARIOUS CONTENDING FACTIONS IN THE
POLITBURO.

11.  THE LEFTIST CAMPAIGN HAS BEEN MUTED IN RECENT MONTHS,
AND THE LOSS OF MAO MAY BE ANOTHER SETBACK.  NEVERTHELESS,
TWO OF THE FOUR POLITBURO STANDING COMMITTEE MEMBERS ARE
LEFTISTS--PARTY VICE CHAIRMAN WANG HUNG-WEN AND CHANG
CH'UN-CH'IAO, WHO HOLDS IMPORTANT PARTY, GOVERNMENT, AND
MILITARY POSTS.  OUTSIDE THE POLITBURO--IN THE STATE
BUREAUCRACY, THE PLA, AND A MAJORITY OF PROVINCIAL
STRUCTURES--THE LEFT IS PROBABLY WEAKER THAN OTHER FAC-
TIONS, BUT IT REMAINS INFLUENTIAL IN THE MEDIA AND MASS
ORGANIZATIONS AND AMONG YOUNGER CADRE.

12.  MODERATE ELEMENTS HAVE NO DOUBT BEEN BUOYED BY THE
RECENT STRESS ON ORDER AND PRODUCTION AND WILL UNDOUBTEDLY
HARP ON THE NEED FOR UNITY AND CONSOLIDATION IN THE WAKE
OF MAO'S PASSING.  HOWEVER, THEY HAVE BEEN WITHOUT A
LEADER SINCE THE DEATH OF CHOU AND THE PURGE OF TENG.
YEH CHIEN-YING, PARTY VICE-CHAIRMAN AND MINISTER OF
DEFENSE, IS THE ONLY MODERATE ON THE STANDING COMMITTEE,
SECRET

PAGE 05        STATE  228857

AND AT 77 HE IS HARDLY LIKELY TO ASSUME AN IMPORTANT LEAD-
ERSHIP ROLE.

13.  PREMIER HUA KUO-FENG, THOUGH STILL A LARGELY UNKNOWN
QUANTITY, MAY BE TRYING TO ASSUME A PIVOTAL ROLE AMONG

COMPETING FACTIONS.  HE IS PARTY FIRST VICE-CHAIRMAN AND
AS SUCH IS A TOP CONTENDER FOR THE CHAIRMANSHIP.  INDEED,
EARTHQUAKE-RELIEF ACTIVITIES HAVE GIVEN HIM THE OPPORTUN-
ITY TO BUILD A POSITIVE POPULAR IMAGE.

14.  TRUE TO HIS PAST POLITICAL PERFORMANCE, HUA HAS
BALANCED MODERATE AND RADICAL STATEMENTS IN RECENT PUBLIC
SPEECHES, BUT HE HAS CLEARLY COME DOWN IN FAVOR OF LAW AND
ORDER AND INCREASED PRODUCTION.  HE MAY BE TRYING TO ESTAB-
LISH HIMSELF AS A NATIONAL FIGURE SIMILAR TO CHOU, SOMEWHAT
ABOVE FACTIONAL SQUABBLES AND ABLE TO BARGAIN WITH ALL
SIDES.  HE HAS A LONG WAY TO GO, HOWEVER, AND IS NOT YET
SECURE IN HIS POSITION AS PREMIER.

15.  THE CURRENT ALIGNMENT OF THE PLA AND ITS TOP LEADERS
IS NOT CLEAR.  WHILE THE LEFT REPORTEDLY HAS A FEW IMPOR-
TANT MILITARY SUPPORTERS, THE PLA HAS GENERALLY RESISTED
LEFTIST ATTEMPTS TO INVOLVE IT DEEPLY IN THE ANTI-TENG
CAMPAIGN, ESPECIALLY REGARDING CRITICISM OF TENG'S MILITARY
LINE.  THE WEIGHT OF PAST EXPERIENCE SUGGESTS THAT THE
MILITARY AS A WHOLE WILL COME DOWN IN FAVOR OF STABILITY
AND ORDER.  INDEED, AS THE MORE MODERATE LINE EVOLVED IN
RECENT WEEKS, THE PLA RECEIVED HIGH PRAISE FOR ITS &quot;HEROIC&quot;
EARTHQUAKE-RELIEF ACTIVITIES.

16.  OF THE ACTIVE MILITARY FIGURES, VICE PREMIER AND
POLITBURO MEMBER CH'EN HSI-LIEN WILL HAVE A PIVOTAL ROLE
IN THE SUCCESSION.  HE REPORTEDLY OVERSEES DEFENSE-RELATED
INDUSTRIES AS WELL AS THE DAY-TO-DAY AFFAIRS OF THE PARTY'S
MILITARY COMMISSION.  SOME EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THAT HE MAY
LEAN TO THE MODERATES.

17.  SHORT-TERM PROSPECTS:

18.  IN THE NEAR FUTURE, APPARENT HARMONY AND ORDER CAN BE
SECRET

PAGE 06        STATE  228857

EXPECTED, BUT THE POSSIBILITY OF A RELATIVELY OPEN POWER
STRUGGLE, SUCH AS DEVELOPED WHEN TENG WAS REMOVED AFTER
CHOU'S DEATH, CANNOT BE RULED OUT COMPLETELY.  THE ANTI-
TENG CAMPAIGN HAS FOSTERED SERIOUS DIVISIONS AT ALL LEVELS
AND WILL EXACERBATE PROBLEMS OF DEVELOPING A STABLE LEADER-
SHIP.

19.  MAO'S DEATH SHOULD BRING AT LEAST A PUBLIC SHOW OF
LEADERSHIP UNITY.  ALL FACTIONS APPEAR COMMITTED TO A
UNITED CHINA AND PRESUMABLY WILL TRY TO AVOID AN OPEN
SPLIT.  NEVERTHELESS, THE TEMPTATION TO PUBLICIZE ANY
STRUGGLE IN ORDER TO GARNER SUPPORT WILL BE GREAT.  IN THIS

REGARD, THE FUNERAL AND MOURNING PERIOD MAY PROVIDE EXCEL-
LENT OPPORTUNITIES TO CLAIM MAO'S SUPPORT FOR VARIOUS
POINTS OF VIEW.

20.  THERE ARE SEVERAL POSSIBLE LEADERSHIP ALIGNMENTS IN
THE NEAR TERM:

21.  A COLLEGIAL LEADERSHIP LED BY INDIVIDUALS ACCEPTABLE
TO MAJOR FACTIONS AND INSTITUTIONS IS THE MOST LIKELY
DEVELOPMENT.  SUCH A COLLECTIVE COALITION MIGHT EMERGE IF
THE LEFT, WHICH HAS NOT SUCCEEDED IN ITS ANTI-TENG
CAMPAIGN, STILL RETAINS ENOUGH CLOUT TO DISCOURAGE A
COUNTER-CAMPAIGN.  TOP POSITIONS WOULD BE DIVIDED AMONG
THE MAJOR FACTIONS AND INTEREST GROUPS.  HUA KUO-FENG,
CHANG CH'UN-CH'IAO, AND CH'EN HSI-LIEN CONSTITUTE A POSSI-
BLE TRIUMVIRATE.  RESPONSIBILITIES WOULD BE SPLIT FAIRLY
EVENLY AMONG VARIOUS FACTIONS.  MANEUVERING FOR DOMINANCE
WOULD LIKELY CONTINUE BEHIND THE SCENES AND A SINGLE PROM-
INENT LEADER PROBABLY WOULD NOT EMERGE FOR SOME TIME.  IT
IS DOUBTFUL THAT THIS COALITION WOULD UNDERTAKE ANY SIGNIF-
ICANT POLICY CHANGES.

22.  A MODERATE-LEANING COALITION.  IF THE RECENT MORE
MODERATE LINE OF THE CAMPAIGN PRESAGES A REAL REASSERTION
OF MODERATE STRENGTH, A NEW COALITION OF MODERATES, PLA
MEN, AND CENTRISTS (SUCH AS HUA) COULD EMERGE.  SUCH A
COALITION WOULD TEND TO STRESS PRODUCTION, UTILIZE MATERIAL
INCENTIVES, PROMOTE LAW AND ORDER, AND ENCOURAGE THE
SECRET

PAGE 07        STATE  228857

IMPORTATION OF FOREIGN TECHNOLOGY.

23.  THE LEFT MIGHT HAVE LITTLE CHOICE BUT TO JOIN SUCH A
GOVERNMENT; IT WOULD CONTINUE AS A VOCAL MINORITY BUT
WITHOUT MAO'S PROTECTION.  MORE PRAGMATIC LEFTISTS LIKE
CHANG CH'UN-CH'IAO PRESUMABLY WOULD TRY TO EXPAND THEIR
APPEAL AND RETAIN AN IMPORTANT VOICE IN THE LEADERSHIP.

24.  IF THE LEFT FELT THREATENED BY GROWING MODERATE UNITY
AND POWER IN SUCH A MODERATE COALITION, IT MIGHT WELL LOOK
TO EXTRA-PARTY ORGANIZATIONS TO PRESS ITS POSITIONS.  BUT
A FORMIDABLE COALITION OF CIVILIAN STATE AND PARTY BUREAU-
CRATS AND MANY PLA COMMANDERS WOULD PROBABLY COALESCE TO
OPPOSE SUCH MANEUVERS.

25.  A LEFT-LEANING COALITION.  IF DESPITE RECENT SETBACKS
THE LEFT IS ABLE TO ATTRACT POLITBURO CENTRISTS OR PERHAPS
PLA MEN TO ITS SIDE, IT MAY BE ABLE TO USE ITS KEY POSI-
TIONS TO DOMINATE A NEW NATIONAL LINEUP.  AS IN 1967, WHEN

CHANG CH'UN-CH'IAO LED LEFTISTS IN A TAKEOVER OF SHANGHAI,
THE LEFT WOULD NEED TO MODERATE SOME OF ITS VIEWS IN ORDER
TO ATTRACT SUPPORT AND BEGIN TO EXPAND ITS INFLUENCE IN
STATE, PROVINCIAL, AND PLA STRUCTURES.  SUCH A COALITION
WOULD EMPHASIZE IDEOLOGY AND SELF-RELIANCE MORE THAN EITHER
OF THE ABOVE-DESCRIBED COALITIONS AND WOULD PROBABLY SEEK
TO DISTANCE THE PRC FROM BOTH THE US AND THE USSR.

26.  A DEADLOCKED AND POLARIZED LEADERSHIP.  IF NEITHER THE
LEFT NOR THE RIGHT SHOWS A WILLINGNESS TO COMPROMISE ITS
POSITION IN THE NEAR FUTURE AND IF BOTH RETAIN SIGNIFICANT
STRENGTH, A STALEMATED GOVERNMENT UNABLE TO ACT COULD RE-
SULT. IN THIS SITUATION, WIDESPREAD DISORDER ON THE SCALE
OF THE CULTURAL REVOLUTION COULD OCCUR.  THE MILITARY MIGHT
THEN PLAY THE DECIDING ROLE AND STEP IN TO RESTORE ORDER.

27.  DOMESTIC ISSUES:

28.  THE LEADERSHIP STRUGGLE WILL CONTINUE TO BE MANIFESTED
IN SERIOUS DEBATES, PRIMARILY OVER DOMESTIC ISSUES.  AMONG
THE MOST CONTENTIOUS ISSUES IN RECENT MONTHS HAVE BEEN:
SECRET

PAGE 08        STATE  228857

(A)--LEGITIMACY OF CULTURAL REVOLUTION.  DEBATE CENTERS
AROUND THE GENERAL VALIDITY OF THE CULTURAL REVOLUTION--
THE DISRUPTIVE MEANS USED, THE INSTITUTIONS AND PRACTICES
CREATED, AND RELATED PERSONNEL PROMOTIONS AND DEMOTIONS.
THIS IS THE LEFT'S MOST IMPORTANT ISSUE BECAUSE MANY
YOUNGER AND MIDDLE CADRE (INCLUDING PREMIER HUA) ROSE
AS A RESULT OF THE CULTURAL REVOLUTION'S PURGES.

(B)--PROMOTION OF YOUTH.  DEBATE HERE FOCUSES ON THE PRIN-
CIPLE OF BRINGING YOUNG CADRES INTO THE LEADERSHIP.
THE LEFT FAVORS A THREE-WAY BALANCE OF YOUNG, MIDDLE,
AND OLD CADRES, WITH MORE RAPID PROMOTION OF ABLE
YOUNG CADRES.

(C)--ECONOMIC POLICY.  THE PERENNIAL RED VERSUS EXPERT
ISSUE AND THE QUESTION OF LOCAL AUTONOMY VERSUS CENTRAL
CONTROL ARE MAJOR POINTS OF CONTENTION HERE. THE MODERATES,
WITH THEIR STRESS ON PRODUCTION AND MATERIAL INCENTIVES,
ENJOY CONSIDERABLE POPULAR SUPPORT ON THESE ISSUES.

(D)--MILITARY MODERNIZATION AND RESOURCE ALLOCATION. THOUGH
THIS SUBJECT HAS NOT BEEN CLEARLY ADDRESSED IN PUBLIC,
MODERATES AND THE PLA HAVE SUPPORTED THE 1975 MILITARY
MODERNIZATION PLAN (WHICH HAS BEEN ASCRIBED TO TENG).

THERE ARE INDICATIONS THAT SOME LEFTISTS ARE OPPOSED TO
AT LEAST PART OF THE PLAN.

29.  FOREIGN POLICY ISSUES:

30. BASIC CONTINUITY IN CHINA'S FOREIGN POLICY IS EXPECTED.
ALL SIGNS POINT TO GENERAL AGREEMENT WITHIN THE PRC LEADER-
SHIP ON CHINA'S STRATEGY OF ANTI-SOVIETISM AND IMPROVED
RELATIONS WITH THE WEST, WHICH HAD MAO'S STRONG ENDORSE-
MENT.  THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THAT FOREIGN POLICY ISSUES HAVE
BEEN CENTRAL TO THE RECENT LEADERSHIP STRUGGLE.

31.  SINCE THE SUCCESSION STRUGGLE BEGAN IN EARNEST WITH
CHOU'S DEATH IN JANUARY, PEKING HAS RESPONDED RAPIDLY AND
WITH APPARENT UNITY TO INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS.  IT
SECRET

PAGE 09        STATE  228857

APPEARS THAT THE LEADERSHIP HAS SUCCESSFULLY ISOLATED
FOREIGN POLICY FROM DOMESTIC POLITICAL MANEUVERING.  CON-
CERN ABOUT POSSIBLE SOVIET EFFORTS TO INTERVENE IN CHINA'S
SUCCESSION ALSO FORMS A POWERFUL CONSTRAINT ON OPEN DIS-
AGREEMENT AND INDECISION.

32.  NEVERTHELESS, EVIDENCE INDICATES THAT THE LEFT LEANS
TOWARD A MORE CHAUVINISTIC FOREIGN POLICY STANCE WHICH
WOULD PLACE CHINA MORE EQUIDISTANT FROM BOTH SUPERPOWERS.
RECOGNIZING THAT A &quot;SELF-RELIANT&quot; FOREIGN POLICY CAN HAVE
BROAD APPEAL TO NATIONALIST SENTIMENT IN CHINA, THE LEFT
MAY WELL SEEK TO CAPITALIZE ON ISSUES RELATED TO CHINESE
SOVEREIGNTY.  THIS HAS ALREADY BEEN REFLECTED, FOR EXAMPLE,
IN THE FOREIGN TRADE CONTEXT, WITH ATTACKS ON POLICIES
WHICH THREATEN TO TIE CHINA'S RESOURCES AND ECONOMY TOO
CLOSELY TO JAPAN AND THE WEST.

33.  THE LEFT FEELS PARTICULARLY STRONGLY ABOUT ISSUES
INVOLVING NATIONAL TERRITORY AND SOVEREIGNTY, AND A LEFT-
LEANING COALITION WOULD BE MORE INCLINED THAN WOULD EITHER
A MODERATE OR A COLLEGIAL ONE TO PRESS THE US HARD TO
BREAK ITS TIES WITH TAIWAN.  FURTHERMORE, A LEFT-LEANING
COALITION WOULD BE THE LEAST LIKELY OF ALL THREE TO MAKE
A POSITIVE RESPONSE TO REITERATED SOVIET OFFERS TO IMPROVE
RELATIONS, WHICH ARE LIKELY TO FOLLOW MAO'S DEATH.  END

1.  FOLLOWING IS TEXT OF INR REPORT NO. 586, &quot;CHINA AFTER
MAO--SHORT TERM PROSPECTS,&quot; DATED SEPTEMBER 13, 1976.  HARD
COPIES FOLLOW BY POUCH.

2.  BEGIN SUMMARY: MAO LEFT NO INSTITUTIONALIZED MEANS FOR
HIS OWN SUCCESSION, AND CONSEQUENTLY COALITION-BUILDING IS
LIKELY TO BE THE ORDER OF THE DAY.  AVAILABLE EVIDENCE
SUGGESTS THAT A ROUGH BALANCE STILL SEEMS TO EXIST AMONG
SECRET

THE VARIOUS CONTENDING FACTIONS IN THE POLITBURO.  IN THE
IMMEDIATE FUTURE, THESE CONTENDING FORCES CAN BE EXPECTED
TO PRESENT AT LEAST A FACADE OF HARMONY AND ORDER, ALTHOUGH
THE POSSIBILITY OF A RELATIVELY OPEN POWER STRUGGLE, SUCH
AS DEVELOPED WHEN TENG WAS REMOVED AFTER CHOU'S DEATH, CAN
NOT BE RULED OUT COMPLETELY.

3.  THE MOST LIKELY LEADERSHIP ALIGNMENT IN THE NEAR TERM
IS A COLLEGIAL ONE LED BY INDIVIDUALS ACCEPTABLE TO MAJOR
FACTIONS AND INSTITUTIONS.  IT IS DOUBTFUL THAT SUCH A
COALITION WOULD UNDERTAKE ANY SIGNIFICANT POLICY CHANGES.
ALTHOUGH A LEFT-LEANING AND A MODERATE-LEANING COALITION
ARE ALSO POSSIBILITIES, CURRENT DIVISIONS ARE SUCH AS TO
MILITATE AGAINST ANY ONE FACTION'S ACHIEVING DOMINANCE.

4.  POLITICAL MANEUVERING WILL CONTINUE TO REVOLVE PRIMARI-
LY AROUND DOMESTIC ISSUES.  THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THAT
FOREIGN POLICY HAS BEEN CENTRAL TO THE LEADERSHIP STRUGGLE,
AND ALL SIGNS POINT TO GENERAL AGREEMENT WITHIN THE LEADER-
SHIP ON THE CURRENT STRATEGY OF ANTI-SOVIETISM AND IMPROVED
RELATIONS WITH THE WEST.  FOREIGN POLICY WILL PROBABLY
CONTINUE WITHOUT MAJOR CHANGES IN THE NEAR FUTURE.

5.  THERE ARE DIFFERENCES IN EMPHASIS, HOWEVER.  THE LEFT
FEELS PARTICULARLY STRONGLY ABOUT ISSUES INVOLVING NATIONAL
TERRITORY AND SOVEREIGNTY, AND A LEFT-LEANING COALITION
WOULD BE MORE INCLINED THAN WOULD EITHER A MODERATE OR A
COLLEGIAL ONE TO PRESS THE US HARD TO BREAK ITS TIES WITH

WARNING NOTICE-SENSITIVE INTELLIGENCE SOURCES AND METHODS
INVOLVED - NOT RELEASABLE TO FOREIGN NATIONALS/NOT RELEAS-
ABLE TO CONTRACTORS OR CONTRACTOR-CONSULTANTS

1.  FOLLOWING IS TEXT OF INR REPORT NO. 586, &quot;CHINA AFTER
MAO--SHORT TERM PROSPECTS,&quot; DATED SEPTEMBER 13, 1976.  HARD
COPIES FOLLOW BY POUCH.

SECRET

PAGE 02        STATE  228857

2.  BEGIN SUMMARY: MAO LEFT NO INSTITUTIONALIZED MEANS FOR
HIS OWN SUCCESSION, AND CONSEQUENTLY COALITION-BUILDING IS
LIKELY TO BE THE ORDER OF THE DAY.  AVAILABLE EVIDENCE
SUGGESTS THAT A ROUGH BALANCE STILL SEEMS TO EXIST AMONG
THE VARIOUS CONTENDING FACTIONS IN THE POLITBURO.  IN THE
IMMEDIATE FUTURE, THESE CONTENDING FORCES CAN BE EXPECTED
TO PRESENT AT LEAST A FACADE OF HARMONY AND ORDER, ALTHOUGH
THE POSSIBILITY OF A RELATIVELY OPEN POWER STRUGGLE, SUCH
AS DEVELOPED WHEN TENG WAS REMOVED AFTER CHOU'S DEATH, CAN
NOT BE RULED OUT COMPLETELY.

3.  THE MOST LIKELY LEADERSHIP ALIGNMENT IN THE NEAR TERM
IS A COLLEGIAL ONE LED BY INDIVIDUALS ACCEPTABLE TO MAJOR
FACTIONS AND INSTITUTIONS.  IT IS DOUBTFUL THAT SUCH A
COALITION WOULD UNDERTAKE ANY SIGNIFICANT POLICY CHANGES.
ALTHOUGH A LEFT-LEANING AND A MODERATE-LEANING COALITION
ARE ALSO POSSIBILITIES, CURRENT DIVISIONS ARE SUCH AS TO
MILITATE AGAINST ANY ONE FACTION'S ACHIEVING DOMINANCE.

4.  POLITICAL MANEUVERING WILL CONTINUE TO REVOLVE PRIMARI-
LY AROUND DOMESTIC ISSUES.  THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THAT
FOREIGN POLICY HAS BEEN CENTRAL TO THE LEADERSHIP STRUGGLE,
AND ALL SIGNS POINT TO GENERAL AGREEMENT WITHIN THE LEADER-
SHIP ON THE CURRENT STRATEGY OF ANTI-SOVIETISM AND IMPROVED
RELATIONS WITH THE WEST.  FOREIGN POLICY WILL PROBABLY
CONTINUE WITHOUT MAJOR CHANGES IN THE NEAR FUTURE.

5.  THERE ARE DIFFERENCES IN EMPHASIS, HOWEVER.  THE LEFT
FEELS PARTICULARLY STRONGLY ABOUT ISSUES INVOLVING NATIONAL
TERRITORY AND SOVEREIGNTY, AND A LEFT-LEANING COALITION
WOULD BE MORE INCLINED THAN WOULD EITHER A MODERATE OR A
COLLEGIAL ONE TO PRESS THE US HARD TO BREAK ITS TIES WITH
TAIWAN.  FURTHERMORE, A LEFTIST COALITION PROBABLY WOULD BE
THE LEAST LIKELY OF THE THREE TO MAKE A POSITIVE RESPONSE
TO REITERATED SOVIET OFFERS TO IMPROVE RELATIONS, WHICH ARE
LIKELY TO FOLLOW MAO'S DEATH.  END SUMMARY.

6.  BEGIN TEXT.  THE DEATH OF MAO, THOUGH LONG ANTICIPATED,
HAS REMOVED A MAJOR INTEGRATIVE FORCE FROM THE CHINESE
POLITICAL SCENE.  HE LEFT NO INSTITUTIONALIZED MEANS FOR
HIS OWN SUCCESSION, AND THE PRC TODAY HAS NO LEADER WITH
SECRET

PAGE 03        STATE  228857

THE PRESTIGE AND AUTHORITY THAT HE OR CHOU EN-LAI HAD.

7.  PROCEDURALLY, A NEW CHAIRMAN SHOULD BE CHOSEN BY A
PLENARY MEETING OF THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE, OR ALTERNATIVELY,
BY THE POLITBURO ITSELF.  SO FAR, HOWEVER, THERE ARE NO
INDICATIONS THAT AN EFFORT WILL BE MADE IN THE IMMEDIATE
FUTURE TO CHOOSE A NEW CHAIRMAN.

8.  IN ANY EVENT, THE ABSENCE OF EITHER A DESIGNATED OR AN
OBVIOUS SUCCESSOR TO MAO SUGGESTS THAT:

(A)--NO PLAN FOR THE SUCCESSION THAT MAY HAVE BEEN WORKED
OUT IN RECENT MONTHS WILL BE INVIOLABLE, EVEN IF MAO
GAVE IT HIS BLESSING.

(B)--LEADERSHIP COMPETITION WILL NOT FOCUS ON ATTEMPTING
TO FIND AN INDIVIDUAL TO FILL MAO'S DISTINCTIVE ROLE

AS POLICY INITIATOR OR ARBITRATOR BUT RATHER ON DECIDING
HOW TO DIVIDE THE POLICY DOMAIN AND FIND AN ALTERNATIVE
MEANS OF RESOLVING LEADERSHIP DISPUTES.

(C)--THE LEADERSHIP MIGHT EVEN RETIRE THE TITLE OF &quot;CHAIR-
MAN&quot; AND EXPAND OR ESTABLISH SEVERAL POSITIONS WHICH WILL
INCLUDE PARTS OF MAO'S PREVIOUS POWERS.

(D)--COALITION-BUILDING IS LIKELY TO BE THE ORDER OF THE
DAY, AND THE PRIMARY ARENA FOR THIS ACTIVITY WILL BE THE
POLITBURO.  NEVERTHELESS, BECAUSE THE CULTURAL REVOLU-
TION LEGITIMIZED APPEALS TO GROUPS AND INSTITUTIONS
OUTSIDE THE PARTY, A FACTION OUTGUNNED IN THE PRIMARY
ARENA MAY TRY TO MOBILIZE MASS ORGANIZATIONS AND DIS-
GRUNTLED LOWER-LEVEL CADRE IN ITS BID FOR POWER.

9.  CURRENT POWER ALIGNMENTS:

10.  THE SUCCESSION STRUGGLE HAS BEEN UNDER WAY IN EARNEST
AT LEAST SINCE CHOU'S DEATH WITHOUT ANY FACTION HAVING
GAINED THE UPPER HAND.  A ROUGH BALANCE STILL SEEMS TO
EXIST AMONG THE VARIOUS CONTENDING FACTIONS IN THE
POLITBURO.
SECRET

PAGE 04        STATE  228857

11.  THE LEFTIST CAMPAIGN HAS BEEN MUTED IN RECENT MONTHS,
AND THE LOSS OF MAO MAY BE ANOTHER SETBACK.  NEVERTHELESS,
TWO OF THE FOUR POLITBURO STANDING COMMITTEE MEMBERS ARE
LEFTISTS--PARTY VICE CHAIRMAN WANG HUNG-WEN AND CHANG
CH'UN-CH'IAO, WHO HOLDS IMPORTANT PARTY, GOVERNMENT, AND
MILITARY POSTS.  OUTSIDE THE POLITBURO--IN THE STATE
BUREAUCRACY, THE PLA, AND A MAJORITY OF PROVINCIAL
STRUCTURES--THE LEFT IS PROBABLY WEAKER THAN OTHER FAC-
TIONS, BUT IT REMAINS INFLUENTIAL IN THE MEDIA AND MASS
ORGANIZATIONS AND AMONG YOUNGER CADRE.

12.  MODERATE ELEMENTS HAVE NO DOUBT BEEN BUOYED BY THE
RECENT STRESS ON ORDER AND PRODUCTION AND WILL UNDOUBTEDLY
HARP ON THE NEED FOR UNITY AND CONSOLIDATION IN THE WAKE
OF MAO'S PASSING.  HOWEVER, THEY HAVE BEEN WITHOUT A
LEADER SINCE THE DEATH OF CHOU AND THE PURGE OF TENG.
YEH CHIEN-YING, PARTY VICE-CHAIRMAN AND MINISTER OF
DEFENSE, IS THE ONLY MODERATE ON THE STANDING COMMITTEE,
AND AT 77 HE IS HARDLY LIKELY TO ASSUME AN IMPORTANT LEAD-
ERSHIP ROLE.

13.  PREMIER HUA KUO-FENG, THOUGH STILL A LARGELY UNKNOWN
QUANTITY, MAY BE TRYING TO ASSUME A PIVOTAL ROLE AMONG

COMPETING FACTIONS.  HE IS PARTY FIRST VICE-CHAIRMAN AND
AS SUCH IS A TOP CONTENDER FOR THE CHAIRMANSHIP.  INDEED,
EARTHQUAKE-RELIEF ACTIVITIES HAVE GIVEN HIM THE OPPORTUN-
ITY TO BUILD A POSITIVE POPULAR IMAGE.

14.  TRUE TO HIS PAST POLITICAL PERFORMANCE, HUA HAS
BALANCED MODERATE AND RADICAL STATEMENTS IN RECENT PUBLIC
SPEECHES, BUT HE HAS CLEARLY COME DOWN IN FAVOR OF LAW AND
ORDER AND INCREASED PRODUCTION.  HE MAY BE TRYING TO ESTAB-
LISH HIMSELF AS A NATIONAL FIGURE SIMILAR TO CHOU, SOMEWHAT
ABOVE FACTIONAL SQUABBLES AND ABLE TO BARGAIN WITH ALL
SIDES.  HE HAS A LONG WAY TO GO, HOWEVER, AND IS NOT YET
SECURE IN HIS POSITION AS PREMIER.

15.  THE CURRENT ALIGNMENT OF THE PLA AND ITS TOP LEADERS
IS NOT CLEAR.  WHILE THE LEFT REPORTEDLY HAS A FEW IMPOR-
SECRET

PAGE 05        STATE  228857

TANT MILITARY SUPPORTERS, THE PLA HAS GENERALLY RESISTED
LEFTIST ATTEMPTS TO INVOLVE IT DEEPLY IN THE ANTI-TENG
CAMPAIGN, ESPECIALLY REGARDING CRITICISM OF TENG'S MILITARY
LINE.  THE WEIGHT OF PAST EXPERIENCE SUGGESTS THAT THE
MILITARY AS A WHOLE WILL COME DOWN IN FAVOR OF STABILITY
AND ORDER.  INDEED, AS THE MORE MODERATE LINE EVOLVED IN
RECENT WEEKS, THE PLA RECEIVED HIGH PRAISE FOR ITS &quot;HEROIC&quot;
EARTHQUAKE-RELIEF ACTIVITIES.

16.  OF THE ACTIVE MILITARY FIGURES, VICE PREMIER AND
POLITBURO MEMBER CH'EN HSI-LIEN WILL HAVE A PIVOTAL ROLE
IN THE SUCCESSION.  HE REPORTEDLY OVERSEES DEFENSE-RELATED
INDUSTRIES AS WELL AS THE DAY-TO-DAY AFFAIRS OF THE PARTY'S
MILITARY COMMISSION.  SOME EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THAT HE MAY
LEAN TO THE MODERATES.

17.  SHORT-TERM PROSPECTS:

18.  IN THE NEAR FUTURE, APPARENT HARMONY AND ORDER CAN BE
EXPECTED, BUT THE POSSIBILITY OF A RELATIVELY OPEN POWER
STRUGGLE, SUCH AS DEVELOPED WHEN TENG WAS REMOVED AFTER
CHOU'S DEATH, CANNOT BE RULED OUT COMPLETELY.  THE ANTI-
TENG CAMPAIGN HAS FOSTERED SERIOUS DIVISIONS AT ALL LEVELS
AND WILL EXACERBATE PROBLEMS OF DEVELOPING A STABLE LEADER-
SHIP.

19.  MAO'S DEATH SHOULD BRING AT LEAST A PUBLIC SHOW OF
LEADERSHIP UNITY.  ALL FACTIONS APPEAR COMMITTED TO A
UNITED CHINA AND PRESUMABLY WILL TRY TO AVOID AN OPEN
SPLIT.  NEVERTHELESS, THE TEMPTATION TO PUBLICIZE ANY
STRUGGLE IN ORDER TO GARNER SUPPORT WILL BE GREAT.  IN THIS

REGARD, THE FUNERAL AND MOURNING PERIOD MAY PROVIDE EXCEL-
LENT OPPORTUNITIES TO CLAIM MAO'S SUPPORT FOR VARIOUS
POINTS OF VIEW.

20.  THERE ARE SEVERAL POSSIBLE LEADERSHIP ALIGNMENTS IN
THE NEAR TERM:

21.  A COLLEGIAL LEADERSHIP LED BY INDIVIDUALS ACCEPTABLE
TO MAJOR FACTIONS AND INSTITUTIONS IS THE MOST LIKELY
SECRET

PAGE 06        STATE  228857

DEVELOPMENT.  SUCH A COLLECTIVE COALITION MIGHT EMERGE IF
THE LEFT, WHICH HAS NOT SUCCEEDED IN ITS ANTI-TENG
CAMPAIGN, STILL RETAINS ENOUGH CLOUT TO DISCOURAGE A
COUNTER-CAMPAIGN.  TOP POSITIONS WOULD BE DIVIDED AMONG
THE MAJOR FACTIONS AND INTEREST GROUPS.  HUA KUO-FENG,
CHANG CH'UN-CH'IAO, AND CH'EN HSI-LIEN CONSTITUTE A POSSI-
BLE TRIUMVIRATE.  RESPONSIBILITIES WOULD BE SPLIT FAIRLY
EVENLY AMONG VARIOUS FACTIONS.  MANEUVERING FOR DOMINANCE
WOULD LIKELY CONTINUE BEHIND THE SCENES AND A SINGLE PROM-
INENT LEADER PROBABLY WOULD NOT EMERGE FOR SOME TIME.  IT
IS DOUBTFUL THAT THIS COALITION WOULD UNDERTAKE ANY SIGNIF-
ICANT POLICY CHANGES.

22.  A MODERATE-LEANING COALITION.  IF THE RECENT MORE
MODERATE LINE OF THE CAMPAIGN PRESAGES A REAL REASSERTION
OF MODERATE STRENGTH, A NEW COALITION OF MODERATES, PLA
MEN, AND CENTRISTS (SUCH AS HUA) COULD EMERGE.  SUCH A
COALITION WOULD TEND TO STRESS PRODUCTION, UTILIZE MATERIAL
INCENTIVES, PROMOTE LAW AND ORDER, AND ENCOURAGE THE
IMPORTATION OF FOREIGN TECHNOLOGY.

23.  THE LEFT MIGHT HAVE LITTLE CHOICE BUT TO JOIN SUCH A
GOVERNMENT; IT WOULD CONTINUE AS A VOCAL MINORITY BUT
WITHOUT MAO'S PROTECTION.  MORE PRAGMATIC LEFTISTS LIKE
CHANG CH'UN-CH'IAO PRESUMABLY WOULD TRY TO EXPAND THEIR
APPEAL AND RETAIN AN IMPORTANT VOICE IN THE LEADERSHIP.

24.  IF THE LEFT FELT THREATENED BY GROWING MODERATE UNITY
AND POWER IN SUCH A MODERATE COALITION, IT MIGHT WELL LOOK
TO EXTRA-PARTY ORGANIZATIONS TO PRESS ITS POSITIONS.  BUT
A FORMIDABLE COALITION OF CIVILIAN STATE AND PARTY BUREAU-
CRATS AND MANY PLA COMMANDERS WOULD PROBABLY COALESCE TO
OPPOSE SUCH MANEUVERS.

25.  A LEFT-LEANING COALITION.  IF DESPITE RECENT SETBACKS
THE LEFT IS ABLE TO ATTRACT POLITBURO CENTRISTS OR PERHAPS
PLA MEN TO ITS SIDE, IT MAY BE ABLE TO USE ITS KEY POSI-
TIONS TO DOMINATE A NEW NATIONAL LINEUP.  AS IN 1967, WHEN

CHANG CH'UN-CH'IAO LED LEFTISTS IN A TAKEOVER OF SHANGHAI,
THE LEFT WOULD NEED TO MODERATE SOME OF ITS VIEWS IN ORDER
SECRET

PAGE 07        STATE  228857

TO ATTRACT SUPPORT AND BEGIN TO EXPAND ITS INFLUENCE IN
STATE, PROVINCIAL, AND PLA STRUCTURES.  SUCH A COALITION
WOULD EMPHASIZE IDEOLOGY AND SELF-RELIANCE MORE THAN EITHER
OF THE ABOVE-DESCRIBED COALITIONS AND WOULD PROBABLY SEEK
TO DISTANCE THE PRC FROM BOTH THE US AND THE USSR.

26.  A DEADLOCKED AND POLARIZED LEADERSHIP.  IF NEITHER THE
LEFT NOR THE RIGHT SHOWS A WILLINGNESS TO COMPROMISE ITS
POSITION IN THE NEAR FUTURE AND IF BOTH RETAIN SIGNIFICANT
STRENGTH, A STALEMATED GOVERNMENT UNABLE TO ACT COULD RE-
SULT. IN THIS SITUATION, WIDESPREAD DISORDER ON THE SCALE
OF THE CULTURAL REVOLUTION COULD OCCUR.  THE MILITARY MIGHT
THEN PLAY THE DECIDING ROLE AND STEP IN TO RESTORE ORDER.

27.  DOMESTIC ISSUES:

28.  THE LEADERSHIP STRUGGLE WILL CONTINUE TO BE MANIFESTED
IN SERIOUS DEBATES, PRIMARILY OVER DOMESTIC ISSUES.  AMONG
THE MOST CONTENTIOUS ISSUES IN RECENT MONTHS HAVE BEEN:

(A)--LEGITIMACY OF CULTURAL REVOLUTION.  DEBATE CENTERS
AROUND THE GENERAL VALIDITY OF THE CULTURAL REVOLUTION--
THE DISRUPTIVE MEANS USED, THE INSTITUTIONS AND PRACTICES
CREATED, AND RELATED PERSONNEL PROMOTIONS AND DEMOTIONS.
THIS IS THE LEFT'S MOST IMPORTANT ISSUE BECAUSE MANY
YOUNGER AND MIDDLE CADRE (INCLUDING PREMIER HUA) ROSE
AS A RESULT OF THE CULTURAL REVOLUTION'S PURGES.

(B)--PROMOTION OF YOUTH.  DEBATE HERE FOCUSES ON THE PRIN-
CIPLE OF BRINGING YOUNG CADRES INTO THE LEADERSHIP.
THE LEFT FAVORS A THREE-WAY BALANCE OF YOUNG, MIDDLE,
AND OLD CADRES, WITH MORE RAPID PROMOTION OF ABLE
YOUNG CADRES.

(C)--ECONOMIC POLICY.  THE PERENNIAL RED VERSUS EXPERT
ISSUE AND THE QUESTION OF LOCAL AUTONOMY VERSUS CENTRAL
CONTROL ARE MAJOR POINTS OF CONTENTION HERE. THE MODERATES,
WITH THEIR STRESS ON PRODUCTION AND MATERIAL INCENTIVES,
ENJOY CONSIDERABLE POPULAR SUPPORT ON THESE ISSUES.

(D)--MILITARY MODERNIZATION AND RESOURCE ALLOCATION. THOUGH
SECRET

PAGE 08        STATE  228857

THIS SUBJECT HAS NOT BEEN CLEARLY ADDRESSED IN PUBLIC,
MODERATES AND THE PLA HAVE SUPPORTED THE 1975 MILITARY
MODERNIZATION PLAN (WHICH HAS BEEN ASCRIBED TO TENG).

THERE ARE INDICATIONS THAT SOME LEFTISTS ARE OPPOSED TO
AT LEAST PART OF THE PLAN.

29.  FOREIGN POLICY ISSUES:

30. BASIC CONTINUITY IN CHINA'S FOREIGN POLICY IS EXPECTED.
ALL SIGNS POINT TO GENERAL AGREEMENT WITHIN THE PRC LEADER-
SHIP ON CHINA'S STRATEGY OF ANTI-SOVIETISM AND IMPROVED
RELATIONS WITH THE WEST, WHICH HAD MAO'S STRONG ENDORSE-
MENT.  THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THAT FOREIGN POLICY ISSUES HAVE
BEEN CENTRAL TO THE RECENT LEADERSHIP STRUGGLE.

31.  SINCE THE SUCCESSION STRUGGLE BEGAN IN EARNEST WITH
CHOU'S DEATH IN JANUARY, PEKING HAS RESPONDED RAPIDLY AND
WITH APPARENT UNITY TO INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS.  IT
APPEARS THAT THE LEADERSHIP HAS SUCCESSFULLY ISOLATED
FOREIGN POLICY FROM DOMESTIC POLITICAL MANEUVERING.  CON-
CERN ABOUT POSSIBLE SOVIET EFFORTS TO INTERVENE IN CHINA'S
SUCCESSION ALSO FORMS A POWERFUL CONSTRAINT ON OPEN DIS-
AGREEMENT AND INDECISION.

32.  NEVERTHELESS, EVIDENCE INDICATES THAT THE LEFT LEANS
TOWARD A MORE CHAUVINISTIC FOREIGN POLICY STANCE WHICH
WOULD PLACE CHINA MORE EQUIDISTANT FROM BOTH SUPERPOWERS.
RECOGNIZING THAT A &quot;SELF-RELIANT&quot; FOREIGN POLICY CAN HAVE
BROAD APPEAL TO NATIONALIST SENTIMENT IN CHINA, THE LEFT
MAY WELL SEEK TO CAPITALIZE ON ISSUES RELATED TO CHINESE
SOVEREIGNTY.  THIS HAS ALREADY BEEN REFLECTED, FOR EXAMPLE,
IN THE FOREIGN TRADE CONTEXT, WITH ATTACKS ON POLICIES
WHICH THREATEN TO TIE CHINA'S RESOURCES AND ECONOMY TOO
CLOSELY TO JAPAN AND THE WEST.

33.  THE LEFT FEELS PARTICULARLY STRONGLY ABOUT ISSUES
INVOLVING NATIONAL TERRITORY AND SOVEREIGNTY, AND A LEFT-
LEANING COALITION WOULD BE MORE INCLINED THAN WOULD EITHER
A MODERATE OR A COLLEGIAL ONE TO PRESS THE US HARD TO
BREAK ITS TIES WITH TAIWAN.  FURTHERMORE, A LEFT-LEANING
SECRET

PAGE 09        STATE  228857

COALITION WOULD BE THE LEAST LIKELY OF ALL THREE TO MAKE
A POSITIVE RESPONSE TO REITERATED SOVIET OFFERS TO IMPROVE
RELATIONS, WHICH ARE LIKELY TO FOLLOW MAO'S DEATH. END

THE LEFT IS ABLE TO ATTRACT POLITBURO CENTRISTS OR PERHAPS
PLA MEN TO ITS SIDE, IT MAY BE ABLE TO USE ITS KEY POSI-
TIONS TO DOMINATE A NEW NATIONAL LINEUP.  AS IN 1967, WHEN

CHANG CH'UN-CH'IAO LED LEFTISTS IN A TAKEOVER OF SHANGHAI,
THE LEFT WOULD NEED TO MODERATE SOME OF ITS VIEWS IN ORDER
TO ATTRACT SUPPORT AND BEGIN TO EXPAND ITS INFLUENCE IN
STATE, PROVINCIAL, AND PLA STRUCTURES.  SUCH A COALITION
WOULD EMPHASIZE IDEOLOGY AND SELF-RELIANCE MORE THAN EITHER
OF THE ABOVE-DESCRIBED COALITIONS AND WOULD PROBABLY SEEK
TO DISTANCE THE PRC FROM BOTH THE US AND THE USSR.

26.  A DEADLOCKED AND POLARIZED LEADERSHIP.  IF NEITHER THE
LEFT NOR THE RIGHT SHOWS A WILLINGNESS TO COMPROMISE ITS
POSITION IN THE NEAR FUTURE AND IF BOTH RETAIN SIGNIFICANT
STRENGTH, A STALEMATED GOVERNMENT UNABLE TO ACT COULD RE-
SULT. IN THIS SITUATION, WIDESPREAD DISORDER ON THE SCALE
OF THE CULTURAL REVOLUTION COULD OCCUR.  THE MILITARY MIGHT
THEN PLAY THE DECIDING ROLE AND STEP IN TO RESTORE ORDER.

27.  DOMESTIC ISSUES:

28.  THE LEADERSHIP STRUGGLE WILL CONTINUE TO BE MANIFESTED
IN SERIOUS DEBATES, PRIMARILY OVER DOMESTIC ISSUES.  AMONG
THE MOST CONTENTIOUS ISSUES IN RECENT MONTHS HAVE BEEN:
SECRET

PAGE 08        STATE  228857

(A)--LEGITIMACY OF CULTURAL REVOLUTION.  DEBATE CENTERS
AROUND THE GENERAL VALIDITY OF THE CULTURAL REVOLUTION--
THE DISRUPTIVE MEANS USED, THE INSTITUTIONS AND PRACTICES
CREATED, AND RELATED PERSONNEL PROMOTIONS AND DEMOTIONS.
THIS IS THE LEFT'S MOST IMPORTANT ISSUE BECAUSE MANY
YOUNGER AND MIDDLE CADRE (INCLUDING PREMIER HUA) ROSE
AS A RESULT OF THE CULTURAL REVOLUTION'S PURGES.

(B)--PROMOTION OF YOUTH.  DEBATE HERE FOCUSES ON THE PRIN-
CIPLE OF BRINGING YOUNG CADRES INTO THE LEADERSHIP.
THE LEFT FAVORS A THREE-WAY BALANCE OF YOUNG, MIDDLE,
AND OLD CADRES, WITH MORE RAPID PROMOTION OF ABLE
YOUNG CADRES.

(C)--ECONOMIC POLICY.  THE PERENNIAL RED VERSUS EXPERT
ISSUE AND THE QUESTION OF LOCAL AUTONOMY VERSUS CENTRAL
CONTROL ARE MAJOR POINTS OF CONTENTION HERE. THE MODERATES,
WITH THEIR STRESS ON PRODUCTION AND MATERIAL INCENTIVES,
ENJOY CONSIDERABLE POPULAR SUPPORT ON THESE ISSUES.

(D)--MILITARY MODERNIZATION AND RESOURCE ALLOCATION. THOUGH
THIS SUBJECT HAS NOT BEEN CLEARLY ADDRESSED IN PUBLIC,
MODERATES AND THE PLA HAVE SUPPORTED THE 1975 MILITARY
MODERNIZATION PLAN (WHICH HAS BEEN ASCRIBED TO TENG).

THERE ARE INDICATIONS THAT SOME LEFTISTS ARE OPPOSED TO
AT LEAST PART OF THE PLAN.

29.  FOREIGN POLICY ISSUES:

30. BASIC CONTINUITY IN CHINA'S FOREIGN POLICY IS EXPECTED.
ALL SIGNS POINT TO GENERAL AGREEMENT WITHIN THE PRC LEADER-
SHIP ON CHINA'S STRATEGY OF ANTI-SOVIETISM AND IMPROVED
RELATIONS WITH THE WEST, WHICH HAD MAO'S STRONG ENDORSE-
MENT.  THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THAT FOREIGN POLICY ISSUES HAVE
BEEN CENTRAL TO THE RECENT LEADERSHIP STRUGGLE.

31.  SINCE THE SUCCESSION STRUGGLE BEGAN IN EARNEST WITH
CHOU'S DEATH IN JANUARY, PEKING HAS RESPONDED RAPIDLY AND
WITH APPARENT UNITY TO INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS.  IT
SECRET

PAGE 09        STATE  228857

APPEARS THAT THE LEADERSHIP HAS SUCCESSFULLY ISOLATED
FOREIGN POLICY FROM DOMESTIC POLITICAL MANEUVERING.  CON-
CERN ABOUT POSSIBLE SOVIET EFFORTS TO INTERVENE IN CHINA'S
SUCCESSION ALSO FORMS A POWERFUL CONSTRAINT ON OPEN DIS-
AGREEMENT AND INDECISION.

32.  NEVERTHELESS, EVIDENCE INDICATES THAT THE LEFT LEANS
TOWARD A MORE CHAUVINISTIC FOREIGN POLICY STANCE WHICH
WOULD PLACE CHINA MORE EQUIDISTANT FROM BOTH SUPERPOWERS.
RECOGNIZING THAT A &quot;SELF-RELIANT&quot; FOREIGN POLICY CAN HAVE
BROAD APPEAL TO NATIONALIST SENTIMENT IN CHINA, THE LEFT
MAY WELL SEEK TO CAPITALIZE ON ISSUES RELATED TO CHINESE
SOVEREIGNTY.  THIS HAS ALREADY BEEN REFLECTED, FOR EXAMPLE,
IN THE FOREIGN TRADE CONTEXT, WITH ATTACKS ON POLICIES
WHICH THREATEN TO TIE CHINA'S RESOURCES AND ECONOMY TOO
CLOSELY TO JAPAN AND THE WEST.

33.  THE LEFT FEELS PARTICULARLY STRONGLY ABOUT ISSUES
INVOLVING NATIONAL TERRITORY AND SOVEREIGNTY, AND A LEFT-
LEANING COALITION WOULD BE MORE INCLINED THAN WOULD EITHER
A MODERATE OR A COLLEGIAL ONE TO PRESS THE US HARD TO
BREAK ITS TIES WITH TAIWAN.  FURTHERMORE, A LEFT-LEANING
COALITION WOULD BE THE LEAST LIKELY OF ALL THREE TO MAKE
A POSITIVE RESPONSE TO REITERATED SOVIET OFFERS TO IMPROVE
RELATIONS, WHICH ARE LIKELY TO FOLLOW MAO'S DEATH.  END

1.  FOLLOWING IS TEXT OF INR REPORT NO. 586, &quot;CHINA AFTER
MAO--SHORT TERM PROSPECTS,&quot; DATED SEPTEMBER 13, 1976.  HARD
COPIES FOLLOW BY POUCH.

2.  BEGIN SUMMARY: MAO LEFT NO INSTITUTIONALIZED MEANS FOR
HIS OWN SUCCESSION, AND CONSEQUENTLY COALITION-BUILDING IS
LIKELY TO BE THE ORDER OF THE DAY.  AVAILABLE EVIDENCE
SUGGESTS THAT A ROUGH BALANCE STILL SEEMS TO EXIST AMONG
SECRET

PAGE 02        STATE  228857

THE VARIOUS CONTENDING FACTIONS IN THE POLITBURO.  IN THE
IMMEDIATE FUTURE, THESE CONTENDING FORCES CAN BE EXPECTED
TO PRESENT AT LEAST A FACADE OF HARMONY AND ORDER, ALTHOUGH
THE POSSIBILITY OF A RELATIVELY OPEN POWER STRUGGLE, SUCH
AS DEVELOPED WHEN TENG WAS REMOVED AFTER CHOU'S DEATH, CAN
NOT BE RULED OUT COMPLETELY.

3.  THE MOST LIKELY LEADERSHIP ALIGNMENT IN THE NEAR TERM
IS A COLLEGIAL ONE LED BY INDIVIDUALS ACCEPTABLE TO MAJOR
FACTIONS AND INSTITUTIONS.  IT IS DOUBTFUL THAT SUCH A
COALITION WOULD UNDERTAKE ANY SIGNIFICANT POLICY CHANGES.
ALTHOUGH A LEFT-LEANING AND A MODERATE-LEANING COALITION
ARE ALSO POSSIBILITIES, CURRENT DIVISIONS ARE SUCH AS TO
MILITATE AGAINST ANY ONE FACTION'S ACHIEVING DOMINANCE.

4.  POLITICAL MANEUVERING WILL CONTINUE TO REVOLVE PRIMARI-
LY AROUND DOMESTIC ISSUES.  THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THAT
FOREIGN POLICY HAS BEEN CENTRAL TO THE LEADERSHIP STRUGGLE,
AND ALL SIGNS POINT TO GENERAL AGREEMENT WITHIN THE LEADER-
SHIP ON THE CURRENT STRATEGY OF ANTI-SOVIETISM AND IMPROVED
RELATIONS WITH THE WEST.  FOREIGN POLICY WILL PROBABLY
CONTINUE WITHOUT MAJOR CHANGES IN THE NEAR FUTURE.

5.  THERE ARE DIFFERENCES IN EMPHASIS, HOWEVER.  THE LEFT
FEELS PARTICULARLY STRONGLY ABOUT ISSUES INVOLVING NATIONAL
TERRITORY AND SOVEREIGNTY, AND A LEFT-LEANING COALITION
WOULD BE MORE INCLINED THAN WOULD EITHER A MODERATE OR A
COLLEGIAL ONE TO PRESS THE US HARD TO BREAK ITS TIES WITH
TAIWAN.  FURTHERMORE, A LEFTIST COALITION PROBABLY WOULD BE
THE LEAST LIKELY OF THE THREE TO MAKE A POSITIVE RESPONSE
TO REITERATED SOVIET OFFERS TO IMPROVE RELATIONS, WHICH ARE
LIKELY TO FOLLOW MAO'S DEATH.  END SUMMARY.

6.  BEGIN TEXT.  THE DEATH OF MAO, THOUGH LONG ANTICIPATED,
HAS REMOVED A MAJOR INTEGRATIVE FORCE FROM THE CHINESE
POLITICAL SCENE.  HE LEFT NO INSTITUTIONALIZED MEANS FOR
HIS OWN SUCCESSION, AND THE PRC TODAY HAS NO LEADER WITH
THE PRESTIGE AND AUTHORITY THAT HE OR CHOU EN-LAI HAD.

7.  PROCEDURALLY, A NEW CHAIRMAN SHOULD BE CHOSEN BY A
PLENARY MEETING OF THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE, OR ALTERNATIVELY,
SECRET

PAGE 03        STATE  228857

BY THE POLITBURO ITSELF.  SO FAR, HOWEVER, THERE ARE NO
INDICATIONS THAT AN EFFORT WILL BE MADE IN THE IMMEDIATE
FUTURE TO CHOOSE A NEW CHAIRMAN.

8.  IN ANY EVENT, THE ABSENCE OF EITHER A DESIGNATED OR AN
OBVIOUS SUCCESSOR TO MAO SUGGESTS THAT:

(A)--NO PLAN FOR THE SUCCESSION THAT MAY HAVE BEEN WORKED
OUT IN RECENT MONTHS WILL BE INVIOLABLE, EVEN IF MAO
GAVE IT HIS BLESSING.

(B)--LEADERSHIP COMPETITION WILL NOT FOCUS ON ATTEMPTING
TO FIND AN INDIVIDUAL TO FILL MAO'S DISTINCTIVE ROLE

AS POLICY INITIATOR OR ARBITRATOR BUT RATHER ON DECIDING
HOW TO DIVIDE THE POLICY DOMAIN AND FIND AN ALTERNATIVE
MEANS OF RESOLVING LEADERSHIP DISPUTES.

(C)--THE LEADERSHIP MIGHT EVEN RETIRE THE TITLE OF &quot;CHAIR-
MAN&quot; AND EXPAND OR ESTABLISH SEVERAL POSITIONS WHICH WILL
INCLUDE PARTS OF MAO'S PREVIOUS POWERS.

(D)--COALITION-BUILDING IS LIKELY TO BE THE ORDER OF THE
DAY, AND THE PRIMARY ARENA FOR THIS ACTIVITY WILL BE THE
POLITBURO.  NEVERTHELESS, BECAUSE THE CULTURAL REVOLU-
TION LEGITIMIZED APPEALS TO GROUPS AND INSTITUTIONS
OUTSIDE THE PARTY, A FACTION OUTGUNNED IN THE PRIMARY
ARENA MAY TRY TO MOBILIZE MASS ORGANIZATIONS AND DIS-
GRUNTLED LOWER-LEVEL CADRE IN ITS BID FOR POWER.

9.  CURRENT POWER ALIGNMENTS:

10.  THE SUCCESSION STRUGGLE HAS BEEN UNDER WAY IN EARNEST
AT LEAST SINCE CHOU'S DEATH WITHOUT ANY FACTION HAVING
GAINED THE UPPER HAND.  A ROUGH BALANCE STILL SEEMS TO
EXIST AMONG THE VARIOUS CONTENDING FACTIONS IN THE
POLITBURO.

11.  THE LEFTIST CAMPAIGN HAS BEEN MUTED IN RECENT MONTHS,
AND THE LOSS OF MAO MAY BE ANOTHER SETBACK.  NEVERTHELESS,
TWO OF THE FOUR POLITBURO STANDING COMMITTEE MEMBERS ARE
SECRET

PAGE 04        STATE  228857

LEFTISTS--PARTY VICE CHAIRMAN WANG HUNG-WEN AND CHANG
CH'UN-CH'IAO, WHO HOLDS IMPORTANT PARTY, GOVERNMENT, AND
MILITARY POSTS.  OUTSIDE THE POLITBURO--IN THE STATE
BUREAUCRACY, THE PLA, AND A MAJORITY OF PROVINCIAL
STRUCTURES--THE LEFT IS PROBABLY WEAKER THAN OTHER FAC-
TIONS, BUT IT REMAINS INFLUENTIAL IN THE MEDIA AND MASS
ORGANIZATIONS AND AMONG YOUNGER CADRE.

12.  MODERATE ELEMENTS HAVE NO DOUBT BEEN BUOYED BY THE
RECENT STRESS ON ORDER AND PRODUCTION AND WILL UNDOUBTEDLY
HARP ON THE NEED FOR UNITY AND CONSOLIDATION IN THE WAKE
OF MAO'S PASSING.  HOWEVER, THEY HAVE BEEN WITHOUT A
LEADER SINCE THE DEATH OF CHOU AND THE PURGE OF TENG.
YEH CHIEN-YING, PARTY VICE-CHAIRMAN AND MINISTER OF
DEFENSE, IS THE ONLY MODERATE ON THE STANDING COMMITTEE,
AND AT 77 HE IS HARDLY LIKELY TO ASSUME AN IMPORTANT LEAD-
ERSHIP ROLE.

13.  PREMIER HUA KUO-FENG, THOUGH STILL A LARGELY UNKNOWN
QUANTITY, MAY BE TRYING TO ASSUME A PIVOTAL ROLE AMONG

COMPETING FACTIONS.  HE IS PARTY FIRST VICE-CHAIRMAN AND
AS SUCH IS A TOP CONTENDER FOR THE CHAIRMANSHIP.  INDEED,
EARTHQUAKE-RELIEF ACTIVITIES HAVE GIVEN HIM THE OPPORTUN-
ITY TO BUILD A POSITIVE POPULAR IMAGE.

14.  TRUE TO HIS PAST POLITICAL PERFORMANCE, HUA HAS
BALANCED MODERATE AND RADICAL STATEMENTS IN RECENT PUBLIC
SPEECHES, BUT HE HAS CLEARLY COME DOWN IN FAVOR OF LAW AND
ORDER AND INCREASED PRODUCTION.  HE MAY BE TRYING TO ESTAB-
LISH HIMSELF AS A NATIONAL FIGURE SIMILAR TO CHOU, SOMEWHAT
ABOVE FACTIONAL SQUABBLES AND ABLE TO BARGAIN WITH ALL
SIDES.  HE HAS A LONG WAY TO GO, HOWEVER, AND IS NOT YET
SECURE IN HIS POSITION AS PREMIER.

15.  THE CURRENT ALIGNMENT OF THE PLA AND ITS TOP LEADERS
IS NOT CLEAR.  WHILE THE LEFT REPORTEDLY HAS A FEW IMPOR-
TANT MILITARY SUPPORTERS, THE PLA HAS GENERALLY RESISTED
LEFTIST ATTEMPTS TO INVOLVE IT DEEPLY IN THE ANTI-TENG
CAMPAIGN, ESPECIALLY REGARDING CRITICISM OF TENG'S MILITARY
LINE.  THE WEIGHT OF PAST EXPERIENCE SUGGESTS THAT THE
SECRET

PAGE 05        STATE  228857

MILITARY AS A WHOLE WILL COME DOWN IN FAVOR OF STABILITY
AND ORDER.  INDEED, AS THE MORE MODERATE LINE EVOLVED IN
RECENT WEEKS, THE PLA RECEIVED HIGH PRAISE FOR ITS &quot;HEROIC&quot;
EARTHQUAKE-RELIEF ACTIVITIES.

16.  OF THE ACTIVE MILITARY FIGURES, VICE PREMIER AND
POLITBURO MEMBER CH'EN HSI-LIEN WILL HAVE A PIVOTAL ROLE
IN THE SUCCESSION.  HE REPORTEDLY OVERSEES DEFENSE-RELATED
INDUSTRIES AS WELL AS THE DAY-TO-DAY AFFAIRS OF THE PARTY'S
MILITARY COMMISSION.  SOME EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THAT HE MAY
LEAN TO THE MODERATES.

17.  SHORT-TERM PROSPECTS:

18.  IN THE NEAR FUTURE, APPARENT HARMONY AND ORDER CAN BE
EXPECTED, BUT THE POSSIBILITY OF A RELATIVELY OPEN POWER
STRUGGLE, SUCH AS DEVELOPED WHEN TENG WAS REMOVED AFTER
CHOU'S DEATH, CANNOT BE RULED OUT COMPLETELY.  THE ANTI-
TENG CAMPAIGN HAS FOSTERED SERIOUS DIVISIONS AT ALL LEVELS
AND WILL EXACERBATE PROBLEMS OF DEVELOPING A STABLE LEADER-
SHIP.

19.  MAO'S DEATH SHOULD BRING AT LEAST A PUBLIC SHOW OF
LEADERSHIP UNITY.  ALL FACTIONS APPEAR COMMITTED TO A
UNITED CHINA AND PRESUMABLY WILL TRY TO AVOID AN OPEN
SPLIT.  NEVERTHELESS, THE TEMPTATION TO PUBLICIZE ANY
STRUGGLE IN ORDER TO GARNER SUPPORT WILL BE GREAT.  IN THIS

REGARD, THE FUNERAL AND MOURNING PERIOD MAY PROVIDE EXCEL-
LENT OPPORTUNITIES TO CLAIM MAO'S SUPPORT FOR VARIOUS
POINTS OF VIEW.

20.  THERE ARE SEVERAL POSSIBLE LEADERSHIP ALIGNMENTS IN
THE NEAR TERM:

21.  A COLLEGIAL LEADERSHIP LED BY INDIVIDUALS ACCEPTABLE
TO MAJOR FACTIONS AND INSTITUTIONS IS THE MOST LIKELY
DEVELOPMENT.  SUCH A COLLECTIVE COALITION MIGHT EMERGE IF
THE LEFT, WHICH HAS NOT SUCCEEDED IN ITS ANTI-TENG
CAMPAIGN, STILL RETAINS ENOUGH CLOUT TO DISCOURAGE A
COUNTER-CAMPAIGN.  TOP POSITIONS WOULD BE DIVIDED AMONG
SECRET

PAGE 06        STATE  228857

THE MAJOR FACTIONS AND INTEREST GROUPS.  HUA KUO-FENG,
CHANG CH'UN-CH'IAO, AND CH'EN HSI-LIEN CONSTITUTE A POSSI-
BLE TRIUMVIRATE.  RESPONSIBILITIES WOULD BE SPLIT FAIRLY
EVENLY AMONG VARIOUS FACTIONS.  MANEUVERING FOR DOMINANCE
WOULD LIKELY CONTINUE BEHIND THE SCENES AND A SINGLE PROM-
INENT LEADER PROBABLY WOULD NOT EMERGE FOR SOME TIME.  IT
IS DOUBTFUL THAT THIS COALITION WOULD UNDERTAKE ANY SIGNIF-
ICANT POLICY CHANGES.

22.  A MODERATE-LEANING COALITION.  IF THE RECENT MORE
MODERATE LINE OF THE CAMPAIGN PRESAGES A REAL REASSERTION
OF MODERATE STRENGTH, A NEW COALITION OF MODERATES, PLA
MEN, AND CENTRISTS (SUCH AS HUA) COULD EMERGE.  SUCH A
COALITION WOULD TEND TO STRESS PRODUCTION, UTILIZE MATERIAL
INCENTIVES, PROMOTE LAW AND ORDER, AND ENCOURAGE THE
IMPORTATION OF FOREIGN TECHNOLOGY.

23.  THE LEFT MIGHT HAVE LITTLE CHOICE BUT TO JOIN SUCH A
GOVERNMENT; IT WOULD CONTINUE AS A VOCAL MINORITY BUT
WITHOUT MAO'S PROTECTION.  MORE PRAGMATIC LEFTISTS LIKE
CHANG CH'UN-CH'IAO PRESUMABLY WOULD TRY TO EXPAND THEIR
APPEAL AND RETAIN AN IMPORTANT VOICE IN THE LEADERSHIP.

24.  IF THE LEFT FELT THREATENED BY GROWING MODERATE UNITY
AND POWER IN SUCH A MODERATE COALITION, IT MIGHT WELL LOOK
TO EXTRA-PARTY ORGANIZATIONS TO PRESS ITS POSITIONS.  BUT
A FORMIDABLE COALITION OF CIVILIAN STATE AND PARTY BUREAU-
CRATS AND MANY PLA COMMANDERS WOULD PROBABLY COALESCE TO
OPPOSE SUCH MANEUVERS.

25.  A LEFT-LEANING COALITION.  IF DESPITE RECENT SETBACKS
THE LEFT IS ABLE TO ATTRACT POLITBURO CENTRISTS OR PERHAPS
PLA MEN TO ITS SIDE, IT MAY BE ABLE TO USE ITS KEY POSI-
TIONS TO DOMINATE A NEW NATIONAL LINEUP.  AS IN 1967, WHEN

CHANG CH'UN-CH'IAO LED LEFTISTS IN A TAKEOVER OF SHANGHAI,
THE LEFT WOULD NEED TO MODERATE SOME OF ITS VIEWS IN ORDER
TO ATTRACT SUPPORT AND BEGIN TO EXPAND ITS INFLUENCE IN
STATE, PROVINCIAL, AND PLA STRUCTURES.  SUCH A COALITION
WOULD EMPHASIZE IDEOLOGY AND SELF-RELIANCE MORE THAN EITHER
OF THE ABOVE-DESCRIBED COALITIONS AND WOULD PROBABLY SEEK
SECRET

PAGE 07        STATE  228857

TO DISTANCE THE PRC FROM BOTH THE US AND THE USSR.

26.  A DEADLOCKED AND POLARIZED LEADERSHIP.  IF NEITHER THE
LEFT NOR THE RIGHT SHOWS A WILLINGNESS TO COMPROMISE ITS
POSITION IN THE NEAR FUTURE AND IF BOTH RETAIN SIGNIFICANT
STRENGTH, A STALEMATED GOVERNMENT UNABLE TO ACT COULD RE-
SULT. IN THIS SITUATION, WIDESPREAD DISORDER ON THE SCALE
OF THE CULTURAL REVOLUTION COULD OCCUR.  THE MILITARY MIGHT
THEN PLAY THE DECIDING ROLE AND STEP IN TO RESTORE ORDER.

27.  DOMESTIC ISSUES:

28.  THE LEADERSHIP STRUGGLE WILL CONTINUE TO BE MANIFESTED
IN SERIOUS DEBATES, PRIMARILY OVER DOMESTIC ISSUES.  AMONG
THE MOST CONTENTIOUS ISSUES IN RECENT MONTHS HAVE BEEN:

(A)--LEGITIMACY OF CULTURAL REVOLUTION.  DEBATE CENTERS
AROUND THE GENERAL VALIDITY OF THE CULTURAL REVOLUTION--
THE DISRUPTIVE MEANS USED, THE INSTITUTIONS AND PRACTICES
CREATED, AND RELATED PERSONNEL PROMOTIONS AND DEMOTIONS.
THIS IS THE LEFT'S MOST IMPORTANT ISSUE BECAUSE MANY
YOUNGER AND MIDDLE CADRE (INCLUDING PREMIER HUA) ROSE

(B)--PROMOTION OF YOUTH.  DEBATE HERE FOCUSES ON THE PRIN-
CIPLE OF BRINGING YOUNG CADRES INTO THE LEADERSHIP.
THE LEFT FAVORS A THREE-WAY BALANCE OF YOUNG, MIDDLE,
AND OLD CADRES, WITH MORE RAPID PROMOTION OF ABLE
YOUNG CADRES.

(C)--ECONOMIC POLICY.  THE PERENNIAL RED VERSUS EXPERT
ISSUE AND THE QUESTION OF LOCAL AUTONOMY VERSUS CENTRAL
CONTROL ARE MAJOR POINTS OF CONTENTION HERE. THE MODERATES,
WITH THEIR STRESS ON PRODUCTION AND MATERIAL INCENTIVES,
ENJOY CONSIDERABLE POPULAR SUPPORT ON THESE ISSUES.

(D)--MILITARY MODERNIZATION AND RESOURCE ALLOCATION. THOUGH
THIS SUBJECT HAS NOT BEEN CLEARLY ADDRESSED IN PUBLIC,
MODERATES AND THE PLA HAVE SUPPORTED THE 1975 MILITARY
MODERNIZATION PLAN (WHICH HAS BEEN ASCRIBED TO TENG).

29.  FOREIGN POLICY ISSUES:

30. BASIC CONTINUITY IN CHINA'S FOREIGN POLICY IS EXPECTED.

SHIP ON CHINA'S STRATEGY OF ANTI-SOVIETISM AND IMPROVED
RELATIONS WITH THE WEST, WHICH HAD MAO'S STRONG ENDORSE-
MENT.  THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THAT FOREIGN POLICY ISSUES HAVE

CHOU'S DEATH, CANNOT BE RULED OUT COMPLETELY.  THE ANTI-
TENG CAMPAIGN HAS FOSTERED SERIOUS DIVISIONS AT ALL LEVELS
AND WILL EXACERBATE PROBLEMS OF DEVELOPING A STABLE LEADER-
SHIP.

19.  MAO'S DEATH SHOULD BRING AT LEAST A PUBLIC SHOW OF
LEADERSHIP UNITY.  ALL FACTIONS APPEAR COMMITTED TO A
UNITED CHINA AND PRESUMABLY WILL TRY TO AVOID AN OPEN
SPLIT.  NEVERTHELESS, THE TEMPTATION TO PUBLICIZE ANY
STRUGGLE IN ORDER TO GARNER SUPPORT WILL BE GREAT.  IN THIS

REGARD, THE FUNERAL AND MOURNING PERIOD MAY PROVIDE EXCEL-
LENT OPPORTUNITIES TO CLAIM MAO'S SUPPORT FOR VARIOUS
POINTS OF VIEW.

20.  THERE ARE SEVERAL POSSIBLE LEADERSHIP ALIGNMENTS IN
THE NEAR TERM:

21.  A COLLEGIAL LEADERSHIP LED BY INDIVIDUALS ACCEPTABLE
TO MAJOR FACTIONS AND INSTITUTIONS IS THE MOST LIKELY
SECRET

PAGE 06        STATE  228857

DEVELOPMENT.  SUCH A COLLECTIVE COALITION MIGHT EMERGE IF
THE LEFT, WHICH HAS NOT SUCCEEDED IN ITS ANTI-TENG
CAMPAIGN, STILL RETAINS ENOUGH CLOUT TO DISCOURAGE A
COUNTER-CAMPAIGN.  TOP POSITIONS WOULD BE DIVIDED AMONG
THE MAJOR FACTIONS AND INTEREST GROUPS.  HUA KUO-FENG,
CHANG CH'UN-CH'IAO, AND CH'EN HSI-LIEN CONSTITUTE A POSSI-
BLE TRIUMVIRATE.  RESPONSIBILITIES WOULD BE SPLIT FAIRLY
EVENLY AMONG VARIOUS FACTIONS.  MANEUVERING FOR DOMINANCE
WOULD LIKELY CONTINUE BEHIND THE SCENES AND A SINGLE PROM-
INENT LEADER PROBABLY WOULD NOT EMERGE FOR SOME TIME.  IT
IS DOUBTFUL THAT THIS COALITION WOULD UNDERTAKE ANY SIGNIF-
ICANT POLICY CHANGES.

22.  A MODERATE-LEANING COALITION.  IF THE RECENT MORE
MODERATE LINE OF THE CAMPAIGN PRESAGES A REAL REASSERTION
OF MODERATE STRENGTH, A NEW COALITION OF MODERATES, PLA
MEN, AND CENTRISTS (SUCH AS HUA) COULD EMERGE.  SUCH A
COALITION WOULD TEND TO STRESS PRODUCTION, UTILIZE MATERIAL
INCENTIVES, PROMOTE LAW AND ORDER, AND ENCOURAGE THE
IMPORTATION OF FOREIGN TECHNOLOGY.

23.  THE LEFT MIGHT HAVE LITTLE CHOICE BUT TO JOIN SUCH A
GOVERNMENT; IT WOULD CONTINUE AS A VOCAL MINORITY BUT
WITHOUT MAO'S PROTECTION.  MORE PRAGMATIC LEFTISTS LIKE
CHANG CH'UN-CH'IAO PRESUMABLY WOULD TRY TO EXPAND THEIR
APPEAL AND RETAIN AN IMPORTANT VOICE IN THE LEADERSHIP.

24.  IF THE LEFT FELT THREATENED BY GROWING MODERATE UNITY
AND POWER IN SUCH A MODERATE COALITION, IT MIGHT WELL LOOK
TO EXTRA-PARTY ORGANIZATIONS TO PRESS ITS POSITIONS.  BUT
A FORMIDABLE COALITION OF CIVILIAN STATE AND PARTY BUREAU-
CRATS AND MANY PLA COMMANDERS WOULD PROBABLY COALESCE TO
OPPOSE SUCH MANEUVERS.

25.  A LEFT-LEANING COALITION.  IF DESPITE RECENT SETBACKS
THE LEFT IS ABLE TO ATTRACT POLITBURO CENTRISTS OR PERHAPS
PLA MEN TO ITS SIDE, IT MAY BE ABLE TO USE ITS KEY POSI-
TIONS TO DOMINATE A NEW NATIONAL LINEUP.  AS IN 1967, WHEN

CHANG CH'UN-CH'IAO LED LEFTISTS IN A TAKEOVER OF SHANGHAI,
THE LEFT WOULD NEED TO MODERATE SOME OF ITS VIEWS IN ORDER
SECRET

PAGE 07        STATE  228857

TO ATTRACT SUPPORT AND BEGIN TO EXPAND ITS INFLUENCE IN
STATE, PROVINCIAL, AND PLA STRUCTURES.  SUCH A COALITION
WOULD EMPHASIZE IDEOLOGY AND SELF-RELIANCE MORE THAN EITHER
OF THE ABOVE-DESCRIBED COALITIONS AND WOULD PROBABLY SEEK
TO DISTANCE THE PRC FROM BOTH THE US AND THE USSR.

26.  A DEADLOCKED AND POLARIZED LEADERSHIP.  IF NEITHER THE
LEFT NOR THE RIGHT SHOWS A WILLINGNESS TO COMPROMISE ITS
POSITION IN THE NEAR FUTURE AND IF BOTH RETAIN SIGNIFICANT
STRENGTH, A STALEMATED GOVERNMENT UNABLE TO ACT COULD RE-
SULT. IN THIS SITUATION, WIDESPREAD DISORDER ON THE SCALE
OF THE CULTURAL REVOLUTION COULD OCCUR.  THE MILITARY MIGHT
THEN PLAY THE DECIDING ROLE AND STEP IN TO RESTORE ORDER.

27.  DOMESTIC ISSUES:

28.  THE LEADERSHIP STRUGGLE WILL CONTINUE TO BE MANIFESTED
IN SERIOUS DEBATES, PRIMARILY OVER DOMESTIC ISSUES.  AMONG
THE MOST CONTENTIOUS ISSUES IN RECENT MONTHS HAVE BEEN:

(A)--LEGITIMACY OF CULTURAL REVOLUTION.  DEBATE CENTERS
AROUND THE GENERAL VALIDITY OF THE CULTURAL REVOLUTION--
THE DISRUPTIVE MEANS USED, THE INSTITUTIONS AND PRACTICES
CREATED, AND RELATED PERSONNEL PROMOTIONS AND DEMOTIONS.
THIS IS THE LEFT'S MOST IMPORTANT ISSUE BECAUSE MANY
YOUNGER AND MIDDLE CADRE (INCLUDING PREMIER HUA) ROSE
AS A RESULT OF THE CULTURAL REVOLUTION'S PURGES.

(B)--PROMOTION OF YOUTH.  DEBATE HERE FOCUSES ON THE PRIN-
CIPLE OF BRINGING YOUNG CADRES INTO THE LEADERSHIP.
THE LEFT FAVORS A THREE-WAY BALANCE OF YOUNG, MIDDLE,
AND OLD CADRES, WITH MORE RAPID PROMOTION OF ABLE
YOUNG CADRES.

(C)--ECONOMIC POLICY.  THE PERENNIAL RED VERSUS EXPERT
ISSUE AND THE QUESTION OF LOCAL AUTONOMY VERSUS CENTRAL
CONTROL ARE MAJOR POINTS OF CONTENTION HERE. THE MODERATES,
WITH THEIR STRESS ON PRODUCTION AND MATERIAL INCENTIVES,
ENJOY CONSIDERABLE POPULAR SUPPORT ON THESE ISSUES.

(D)--MILITARY MODERNIZATION AND RESOURCE ALLOCATION. THOUGH
SECRET

PAGE 08        STATE  228857

THIS SUBJECT HAS NOT BEEN CLEARLY ADDRESSED IN PUBLIC,
MODERATES AND THE PLA HAVE SUPPORTED THE 1975 MILITARY
MODERNIZATION PLAN (WHICH HAS BEEN ASCRIBED TO TENG).

THERE ARE INDICATIONS THAT SOME LEFTISTS ARE OPPOSED TO
AT LEAST PART OF THE PLAN.

29.  FOREIGN POLICY ISSUES:

30. BASIC CONTINUITY IN CHINA'S FOREIGN POLICY IS EXPECTED.
ALL SIGNS POINT TO GENERAL AGREEMENT WITHIN THE PRC LEADER-
SHIP ON CHINA'S STRATEGY OF ANTI-SOVIETISM AND IMPROVED
RELATIONS WITH THE WEST, WHICH HAD MAO'S STRONG ENDORSE-
MENT.  THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THAT FOREIGN POLICY ISSUES HAVE
BEEN CENTRAL TO THE RECENT LEADERSHIP STRUGGLE.

31.  SINCE THE SUCCESSION STRUGGLE BEGAN IN EARNEST WITH
CHOU'S DEATH IN JANUARY, PEKING HAS RESPONDED RAPIDLY AND
WITH APPARENT UNITY TO INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENTS.  IT
APPEARS THAT THE LEADERSHIP HAS SUCCESSFULLY ISOLATED
FOREIGN POLICY FROM DOMESTIC POLITICAL MANEUVERING.  CON-
CERN ABOUT POSSIBLE SOVIET EFFORTS TO INTERVENE IN CHINA'S
SUCCESSION ALSO FORMS A POWERFUL CONSTRAINT ON OPEN DIS-
AGREEMENT AND INDECISION.

32.  NEVERTHELESS, EVIDENCE INDICATES THAT THE LEFT LEANS
TOWARD A MORE CHAUVINISTIC FOREIGN POLICY STANCE WHICH
WOULD PLACE CHINA MORE EQUIDISTANT FROM BOTH SUPERPOWERS.
RECOGNIZING THAT A &quot;SELF-RELIANT&quot; FOREIGN POLICY CAN HAVE
BROAD APPEAL TO NATIONALIST SENTIMENT IN CHINA, THE LEFT
MAY WELL SEEK TO CAPITALIZE ON ISSUES RELATED TO CHINESE
SOVEREIGNTY.  THIS HAS ALREADY BEEN REFLECTED, FOR EXAMPLE,
IN THE FOREIGN TRADE CONTEXT, WITH ATTACKS ON POLICIES
WHICH THREATEN TO TIE CHINA'S RESOURCES AND ECONOMY TOO
CLOSELY TO JAPAN AND THE WEST.

33.  THE LEFT FEELS PARTICULARLY STRONGLY ABOUT ISSUES
INVOLVING NATIONAL TERRITORY AND SOVEREIGNTY, AND A LEFT-
LEANING COALITION WOULD BE MORE INCLINED THAN WOULD EITHER
A MODERATE OR A COLLEGIAL ONE TO PRESS THE US HARD TO
BREAK ITS TIES WITH TAIWAN.  FURTHERMORE, A LEFT-LEANING
SECRET

PAGE 09        STATE  228857

COALITION WOULD BE THE LEAST LIKELY OF ALL THREE TO MAKE
A POSITIVE RESPONSE TO REITERATED SOVIET OFFERS TO IMPROVE
RELATIONS, WHICH ARE LIKELY TO FOLLOW MAO'S DEATH. END
