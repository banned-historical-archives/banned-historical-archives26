		<h3>Tor</h3>
		<p><a href="https://www.torproject.org">Tor</a> is an encrypted anonymising network that makes it harder to intercept internet communications, or see where communications are coming from or going to.</p>
		<p>In order to use the WikiLeaks public submission system as detailed above you can download the Tor Browser Bundle, which is a Firefox-like browser available for Windows, Mac OS X and GNU/Linux and pre-configured to connect using the anonymising system Tor.</p>
		<h4>Tails</h4>
		<p>If you are at high risk and you have the capacity to do so, you can also access the submission system through a secure operating system called <a href="https://tails.boum.org">Tails</a>. Tails is an operating system launched from a USB stick or a DVD that aim to leaves no traces when the computer is shut down after use and automatically routes your internet traffic through Tor. Tails will require you to have either a USB stick or a DVD at least 4GB big and a laptop or desktop computer.</p>

		<h3>Tips</h3>
		<p>Our submission system works hard to preserve your anonymity, but we recommend you also take some of your own precautions. Please review these basic guidelines. </p>
		<div>
			<h4>1. Contact us if you have specific problems</h4>
			<p>If you have a very large submission, or a submission with a complex format, or are a high-risk source, please <a href="#submit_help_contact">contact us</a>. In our experience it is always possible to find a custom solution for even the most seemingly difficult situations.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h4>2. What computer to use</h4>
			<p>If the computer you are uploading from could subsequently be audited in an investigation, consider using a computer that is not easily tied to you. Technical users can also use <a href="https://tails.boum.org">Tails</a> to help ensure you do not leave any records of your submission on the computer.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h4>3. Do not talk about your submission to others</h4>
			<p>If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in source protection – it is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This includes other media organisations.</p>
		</div>

	</div>
</div>

<div id="submit_help_after" class="submit_elem">

			</div>
		</div>

		<h3>After</h3>

		<div>
			<h4>1. Do not talk about your submission to others</h4>
			<p>If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in source protection – it is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This includes other media organisations.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h4>2. Act normal</h4>
			<p>If you are a high-risk source, avoid saying anything or doing anything after submitting which might promote suspicion. In particular, you should try to stick to your normal routine and behaviour.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h4>3. Remove traces of your submission</h4>
			<p>If you are a high-risk source and the computer you prepared your submission on, or uploaded it from, could subsequently be audited in an investigation, we recommend that you format and dispose of the computer hard drive and any other storage media you used.</p>
			<p>In particular, hard drives retain data after formatting which may be visible to a digital forensics team and flash media (USB sticks, memory cards and SSD drives) retain data even after a secure erasure. If you used flash media to store sensitive data, it is important to destroy the media.</p>
			<p>If you do this and are a high-risk source you should make sure there are no traces of the clean-up, since such traces themselves may draw suspicion.</p>
			<div>
				<h4>4. If you face legal action</h4>
				<p>If a legal action is brought against you as a result of your submission, there are organisations that may help you. The Courage Foundation is an international organisation dedicated to the protection of journalistic sources. You can find more details at <a href="https://www.couragefound.org">https://www.couragefound.org</a>.</p>

		<p>WikiLeaks publishes documents of political or historical importance that are censored or otherwise suppressed. We specialise in strategic global publishing and large archives.</p>
		<p>The following is the address of our secure site where you can anonymously upload your documents to WikiLeaks editors. You can only access this submissions system through Tor. (See our <a href="#submit_help_tor">Tor tab</a> for more information.) We also advise you to read our <a href="#submit_help_tips">tips for sources</a> before submitting.</p>

<h1 style="display: none">The Global Intelligence Files</h1>
   <p>On Monday February 27th, 2012, WikiLeaks began publishing <i>The Global Intelligence Files</i>, over five million e-mails from the Texas headquartered  "global intelligence" company Stratfor. The e-mails date between July  2004 and late December 2011. They reveal the inner workings of a company  that fronts as an intelligence publisher, but provides confidential  intelligence services to large corporations, such as Bhopal's Dow  Chemical Co., Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, Raytheon and government  agencies, including the US Department of Homeland Security, the US  Marines and the US Defence Intelligence Agency. The emails show  Stratfor's web of informers, pay-off structure, payment laundering techniques and psychological methods.</p>

<br />
   East Asia<br />
<br />
   A.      Korean Peninsula: In a strategic sense, North Korea is much less<br />
   dynamic than it may at first appear, and the perceptions of internal<br />
   instability or external unpredictability are exaggerated. Nonetheless,<br />
   Pyongyang has learned to shape and harness perceptions toward its own end,<br />
   and events in North Korea can reverberate on a day to day basis on the<br />
   Korean Peninsula and in the surrounding region. North Korea is currently<br />
   attempting its first live transfer of power, from Kim Jong Il to his son<br />
   Kim Jong Un. The elder Kim delayed identifying which son would ultimately<br />
   succeed him for quite some time, seeking to head off any formation of<br />
   cliques or competing centers of power within the regime forming around the<br />
   three sons. (Kim himself began building his own cadre of support long<br />
   before the death of his father, Kim Il Sung, and was not always walking<br />
   the same line as his father.) However, particularly amid ill health, it<br />
   became necessary to clearly identify a successor, as, despite best<br />
   efforts, internal factions were already forming around the three sons, and<br />
   neighboring countries were trying to influence the choice and strengthen<br />
   their own preferred successor. With Kim Jong Un now clearly the chosen<br />
   successor, the next leader is working to consolidate his own support base,<br />
   with and in spite of assistance from his father. As was seen in the<br />
   1994-1997 transitional period between Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il, we are<br />
   now seeing again the pattern of internal reshuffling and purges as the<br />
   next in line to the Kim dynasty cleans house and removes obstacles to his<br />
   authority. This is not an entirely chaotic process, and is being done<br />
   within the framework of the oversight of Kim Jong Il. But as North Korea<br />
   is not a monolithic regime, but rather one where the top leader retains<br />
   power and control by balancing various internal interest groups, the<br />
   process is not without its resultant increases in domestic social<br />
   instability and resultant crackdowns. Complicating matters externally,<br />
   much of the information about what is happening in North Korea is coming<br />
   from various private interest groups that have a clear agenda to<br />
   exaggerate perceived instability and brutality, or extrapolate the<br />
   conditions in one part of the country as applying to all. As Pyongyang<br />
   prepares for an experiment in live transfer of power (the idea being that<br />
   Kim Jong Il would continue to control things from behind the scenes while<br />
   Kim Jong Un would get on-the-job training, in a manner similar to that<br />
   followed by Deng Xiaoping in China), there is an increased desire to<br />
   resolve the longstanding contention with the United States, potentially<br />
   opening new economic opportunities for the North. This does not mean North<br />
   Korea will give up on its perceived strategic interests, or be an easy<br />
   negotiating partner. As we have seen repeatedly, Pyongyang prefers to<br />
   blend acts of a threatening nature with its negotiating strategy, and if<br />
   it follows pattern, there is the likelihood of a new long-range<br />
   missile/SLV test and another nuclear demonstration. Potentially<br />
   complicating matters for overall negotiations, Russia has re-entered its<br />
   scene, and is working with North Korea in proposed rail and pipeline<br />
   projects to South Korea. Moscowa**s interest is stronger in the<br />
   implications for relations with South Korea, but its actions in the North<br />
   may trigger increased competition for Pyongyang with China. That could<br />
   both give North Korea more room to maneuver, and make it more difficult to<br />
   shape North Korean behavior. Amid the leadership transition issues in<br />
   North Korea, South Korea will hold both parliamentary and presidential<br />
   elections in 2012 (only every 20 years do the two elections align in the<br />
   same year). As President Lee Myung Bak nears the end of his<br />
   Constitutionally mandated single term, he may follow the path of previous<br />
   South Korean presidents and seek to leave his mark on inter-Korean<br />
   relations by arranging a summit meeting with Kim Jong Il. When the new<br />
   leadership in South Korea comes to power, there is the potential for a<br />
   disruption in the continuity of North Korean policy.<br />
<br />
   A.       <br />
<br />
   A.      Japan: Japan remains a key center of gravity in East Asia, and <br />
   the US alliance with Japan will remain pivotal for the foreseeable future.<br />
   The Japanese economy remains effectively the second strongest in the world<br />
   (China only officially surpassed it in total GDP after a decades of<br />
   manipulated and unreliable economic figures), and the Japanese military<br />
   has maintained a modernization of equipment, training, inter-operability<br />
   and evolving doctrine. Japan also possesses high-caliber and far-reaching<br />
   intelligence capabilities. Where China appears powerful and economically<br />
   vibrant, but underneath is facing significant internal crises, Japan<br />
   appears in a malaise but remains socially cohesive and continues as a<br />
   strong manufacturing and technology power. Japana**s quiet strength and<br />
   stability makes it harder for external powers to shape its direction, but<br />
   Tokyo continues to make cautious, quiet moves around the region and beyond<br />
   to protect its interests and security. The Japanese political system may<br />
   be nearing a turning point. The frequent turnover of Prime Ministers has<br />
   continued apace even with the transfer of power to the DPJ from the<br />
   long-ruling LDP, but there are hints that a more nationalistic sentiment<br />
   may be emerging in a country that has jointly endured two decades of<br />
   economic malaise.<br />
<br />
   A.       <br />
<br />
   A.      China: China is in the midst of a major social, economic and<br />
   political crisis that has been building for many years a** one that is<br />
   being exacerbated by the lack of a robust recovery of European and<br />
   American economies (and the lack of one on the horizon). This internal<br />
   tension and internal focus will persist beyond the 2012 leadership<br />
   transition, which will see increasing military representation and<br />
   influence in the civilian leadership. Whereas Japan appears outwardly weak<br />
   but stands on strong fundamentals, China is the opposite: Beijing has<br />
   become increasingly expert in perception management a** crafting the<br />
   outward image of a strong and inexorable growth masking internal weakness<br />
   and contradiction.<br />
<br />
    <br />
<br />
   Ultimately, the primary goal of the Chinese system is the maintenance of<br />
   party leadership a** regime survival. Second is the unity of the nation,<br />
   as this serves the primary goal. Last and least is the enrichment of the<br />
   Chinese people -- which in any event is never in fact a goal in itself but<br />
   simply a vehicle towards the first two objectives. Amidst this crisis is<br />
   another a** the shift from the decentralized management of the economy<br />
   back to a centralized model. Deng Xiaoping promoted a model of economic<br />
   growth that ultimately devolved much to the provincial and local<br />
   governments. So long as they met or exceeded their growth targets, they<br />
   were seen as successful. The idea was to rapidly accelerate Chinaa**s<br />
   economic growth, and in many ways it was successful. But a result was<br />
   something seen throughout Chinese dynastic history a** the devolution not<br />
   only of economic policy but ultimately of overall power from the center to<br />
   the regions. As the economy grew, so did the connections between local<br />
   officials and business interests. It has reached a point where Beijing has<br />
   a difficult time enforcing any central macroeconomic policies due to<br />
   resistance of the local leadership. But the changes in the global economic<br />
   situation, and the limits of the Chinese economic model, as well as the<br />
   perceived sense of rising social dissatisfaction, has triggered a drive<br />
   toward recentralization of economic and social control. This in many ways<br />
   is pitting the central government against regional and local interest. It<br />
   is also causing problems for private industry, in a country where SMEs<br />
   comprise some 70 percent of employment. Central government policies to<br />
   deal with inflation have triggered a contraction of available lending, and<br />
   Chinese banks are strongly favoring State Owned Enterprises over<br />
   comparable sized or smaller private enterprises. This lack of available<br />
   capital has led to a boom in grey-area lending with high interest rates,<br />
   at a time when commodity imports and raw material prices are high and<br />
   export prices of manufactured goods are low.<br />
<br />
    <br />
<br />
    <br />
<br />
   Perceptions of Chinese military power are equally skewed. The development<br />
   and showcasing of high-end weapons capabilities has two values. The first<br />
   is its nationalistic value a** a nationalism that might transcend<br />
   ethnicity or region and highlight more generic Chinese achievement. The<br />
   second is the more that China can appear to be a military-technological<br />
   near-peer competitor to the United States (or even increase discussion of<br />
   such capability), serve the Chinese interest by making the threat of war<br />
   more imposing, thereby disincentivizing and deterring any attempt by an<br />
   outside power to do what the regime really fears a** tinkering with<br />
   internal stability.<br />
<br />
   In truth, there is little indication that the Chinese have mastered the<br />
   integration of the various systems they have so deliberately acquired<br />
   through various means. This piecemeal copying and clandestine acquisition<br />
   of individual pieces of high-end military hardware does not entail the<br />
   ability to integrate it into a functional system a** much less operate it<br />
   effectively.<br />
<br />
   However, what China is doing well and deliberately is cultivating its<br />
   influence around the region, focusing its efforts in the Melanesian<br />
   islands, and through archipelagic and continental southeast Asia. China is<br />
   deliberately buying influence and cultivating relations both<br />
   state-to-state and with every available political group within a country<br />
   in order to ensure maximal leverage and flexibility. It is not Chinaa**s<br />
   cutting-edge weapons development that should be of concern but its ability<br />
   to escalate or de-escalate crises and its ability to readily funnel<br />
   higher-end but established and proven weaponry (anti-ship missiles, air<br />
   defense systems, anti-tank guided missiles, etc.) to proxies and disputed<br />
   territories to complicate a crisis to its advantage. Should the Chinese<br />
   feel significantly threatened at home, they have the ability to follow the<br />
   Soviet model and instigate crises in different locations, drawing the<br />
   attention of the United States and its allies to places away from the<br />
   Chinese shores. Places like Aceh, on the Straight of Malacca, or West<br />
   Papua in the Indonesian islands, minor skirmishes in the South China Sea<br />
   (with Vietnam, to which the US is less likely to intervene), or even in<br />
   places in Africa or South America could be areas where China could use<br />
   low-cost low-risk activities to kindle crises that distract U.S.<br />
   attention.<br />
<br />
    PROBABLY NEEDS MORE ON PROXY IDEA.<br />
<br />
   A.      The South China Sea a**Battleboxa**: Chinaa**s fundamental problem<br />
   and the critical geographic feature of the region is the a**battleboxa**<br />
   of the South China Sea. The geography favors the one who controls the<br />
   outer territory of the chain, and that is currently the United States. The<br />
   nations that border the South China Sea are already increasingly wary of<br />
   increasing Chinese assertiveness and aggressiveness and are anxious for a<br />
   more distant power to play a balancing role. Joint training exercises with<br />
   and cultivation of domestic naval infantry/Marine forces in Indonesia,<br />
   Vietnam, Malaysia and the Philippines in particular would be a low cost,<br />
   high return strategy. While this entails the opportunity for Chinese<br />
   aggression to strengthen the value allies and partners place on their<br />
   relationship with the U.S. but the risk that those allies and partners<br />
   will expect U.S. involvement and support in territorial disputes and other<br />
   security related issues with China following, for example, a naval<br />
   skirmish and an interrelated risk of Washingtona**s deference to Beijing<br />
   for larger economic and political purposes in times of crisis being<br />
   interpreted by allies and partners as evidence of the weakness of the U.S.<br />
   security guarantee. (Though China is already perceiving every minor effort<br />
   in East Asia to be a potential sign of a containment strategy.)<br />
