		<h3>Tor</h3>
		<p><a href="https://www.torproject.org">Tor</a> is an encrypted anonymising network that makes it harder to intercept internet communications, or see where communications are coming from or going to.</p>
		<p>In order to use the WikiLeaks public submission system as detailed above you can download the Tor Browser Bundle, which is a Firefox-like browser available for Windows, Mac OS X and GNU/Linux and pre-configured to connect using the anonymising system Tor.</p>
		<h4>Tails</h4>
		<p>If you are at high risk and you have the capacity to do so, you can also access the submission system through a secure operating system called <a href="https://tails.boum.org">Tails</a>. Tails is an operating system launched from a USB stick or a DVD that aim to leaves no traces when the computer is shut down after use and automatically routes your internet traffic through Tor. Tails will require you to have either a USB stick or a DVD at least 4GB big and a laptop or desktop computer.</p>

		<h3>Tips</h3>
		<p>Our submission system works hard to preserve your anonymity, but we recommend you also take some of your own precautions. Please review these basic guidelines. </p>
		<div>
			<h4>1. Contact us if you have specific problems</h4>
			<p>If you have a very large submission, or a submission with a complex format, or are a high-risk source, please <a href="#submit_help_contact">contact us</a>. In our experience it is always possible to find a custom solution for even the most seemingly difficult situations.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h4>2. What computer to use</h4>
			<p>If the computer you are uploading from could subsequently be audited in an investigation, consider using a computer that is not easily tied to you. Technical users can also use <a href="https://tails.boum.org">Tails</a> to help ensure you do not leave any records of your submission on the computer.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h4>3. Do not talk about your submission to others</h4>
			<p>If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in source protection – it is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This includes other media organisations.</p>
		</div>

	</div>

		<h3>After</h3>

		<div>
			<h4>1. Do not talk about your submission to others</h4>
			<p>If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in source protection – it is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This includes other media organisations.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h4>2. Act normal</h4>
			<p>If you are a high-risk source, avoid saying anything or doing anything after submitting which might promote suspicion. In particular, you should try to stick to your normal routine and behaviour.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h4>3. Remove traces of your submission</h4>
			<p>If you are a high-risk source and the computer you prepared your submission on, or uploaded it from, could subsequently be audited in an investigation, we recommend that you format and dispose of the computer hard drive and any other storage media you used.</p>
			<p>In particular, hard drives retain data after formatting which may be visible to a digital forensics team and flash media (USB sticks, memory cards and SSD drives) retain data even after a secure erasure. If you used flash media to store sensitive data, it is important to destroy the media.</p>
			<p>If you do this and are a high-risk source you should make sure there are no traces of the clean-up, since such traces themselves may draw suspicion.</p>
			<div>
				<h4>4. If you face legal action</h4>
				<p>If a legal action is brought against you as a result of your submission, there are organisations that may help you. The Courage Foundation is an international organisation dedicated to the protection of journalistic sources. You can find more details at <a href="https://www.couragefound.org">https://www.couragefound.org</a>.</p>

		<p>WikiLeaks publishes documents of political or historical importance that are censored or otherwise suppressed. We specialise in strategic global publishing and large archives.</p>
		<p>The following is the address of our secure site where you can anonymously upload your documents to WikiLeaks editors. You can only access this submissions system through Tor. (See our <a href="#submit_help_tor">Tor tab</a> for more information.) We also advise you to read our <a href="#submit_help_tips">tips for sources</a> before submitting.</p>

			<!--<div>
				Copy this address into your Tor browser. Advanced users, if they wish, can also add a further layer of encryption to their submission using <a href="#submit_wlkey">our public PGP key</a>.
			</div>-->
		</div>

		<p>If you cannot use Tor, or your submission is very large, or you have specific requirements, WikiLeaks provides several alternative methods. <a href="#submit_help_contact">Contact us</a> to discuss how to proceed.</p>

REPLACEMENT AIRCRAFT, SOUTH VIETS &quot;RELUCTANT TO EXPOSE
THEMSELVES&quot; IN SOME AREAS THEY NORMALLY WOULD (UPI
NYDN, CHITRIB).

IN TET ADDRESS, THIEU SAYS MORE BLOODSHED AND HARD
TIMES AHEAD; AGAIN RULES OUT COALITION GOVT WITH VC,
AND PLEDGES TO FIGHT UNTIL ALL COMMUNIST FORCES DEFEATED
(AP SUN, NYDN, CHITRIB; WP).

OVER 20 OPPOSITION DEPUTIES AND SENATORS STAGE 24-HR
HUNGER STRIKE IN FRONT OF NATL ASSEMBLY BLDG, CHANT
ANTI-THIEU SLOGANS AND BURN HIS PICTURE.  DEMONSTRATION
BEGAN AS PROTEST AGAINST GVN'S CLOSING OF OPPOSITION
NEWSPAPERS (AP SUN, CHITRIB; WP; CSM).  ANOTHER ANTI-
GVN DEMONSTRATION STAGED BY 27 BUDDHIST NUNS WHO
GATHERED NEAR PRES PALACE AND SCUFFLED WITH POLICE

WHO EVENTUALLY HERDED THEM INTO VANS AND TOOK THEM
AWAY (CSM; WP).  NUNS CARRIED POSTERS THREATENING TO
BURN SELVES IF REPRESSED; POLICE SEIZED CAN OF GASOLINE
FROM THEM (WP).

NYT'S MARKHAM IN SAIGON DESCRIBES PROTESTS MONDAY BY
OPPOSITION PARLIAMENTARIANS AND RELIGIOUS GROUP; NOTES

NYT'S SCHANBERG IN PP NOTES EVERY YR MANY FOREIGNERS
LEAVE CITY DURING COMMUNIST DRY SEASON OFFENSIVE;
BUT THIS YR EXODUS STARTED EARLIER THAN USUAL, AT
LEAST PARTLY BECAUSE OF POWER CUTS TO CONSERVE FUEL.
BELIEVES FOREIGNERS' DEPARTURE HAS ALMOST NO EFFECT
ON KHMERS, WHO HAVE OTHER THINGS TO WORRY ABOUT.
POINTS OUT DEPARTEES, AS USUAL, GOING ONLY FAR AS
BANGKOK, VIENTIANE, OR SAIGON TO WAIT OUT EVENTS.  IN
PAST, THEY CAME BACK WHEN &quot;EASY LIFE&quot; POSSIBLE AGAIN,
BUT NOW DIFFERENCES CONTRIBUTE TO PESSIMISM ABOUT GKR:
CONGRESS APPEARS DETERMINED  TO LIMIT US MIL AID AND
MEKONG IS BLOCKADED.  SCHANBERG SEES US OFFICIALS IN
PP IN STICKY POSITION SINCE THEY HAVE TO MAKE SITUATION
SOUND SERIOUS TO PRESSURE CONGRESS FOR MORE FUNDS, BUT
NOT SO BAD AS TO FRIGHTEN PEOPLE INTO LEAVING.  QUOTES

AMERICANS THAT MIL SITUATION NEAR HP DOES NOT JUSTIFY
EVACUATION, BUT WITH MEKONG CUT, SUPPLIES LIKELY TO
START GETTING SHORTER.  IF QUICK EVACUATION BECOMES
NECESSARY, US HAS EMERGENCY PLAN INVOLVING AIRLIFT

COMMENT AND ANALYSIS

7.  INDOCHINA

FORMER NSC MEMBER CHESTER COOPER IN WP DOES LENGTHY
ARTICLE ON FATEFUL DAY TEN YEARS AGO WHEN VC STRUCK
AIRFIELD IN PLEIKU, KILLED EIGHT AMERICANS AND
PRECIPITATED MASSIVE US RETALIATION AND INTERVENTION.

SEN HATFIELD IN LAT (2/9) AND PHINQ ARGUES US CAN'T
AFFORD TO SUPPORT THIEU SINCE AID ONLY PERPETUATES
&quot;BANKRUPT POLICY.&quot;  STATES GVN CONTINUALLY PRACTICES
DENIAL OF HUMAN RIGHTS.  SEES NO INTERNATIONAL LEGAL
OBLIGATION TO SUPPORT THIEU.  DENOUNCES IMAGE OF
MASSIVE NVA BUILDUP AS MYTH.  BELIEVES ADMIN REQUEST
MAY BE EFFORT TO BLAME CONGRESS FOR FAILURE OF POLICY.
CALLS INTERVENTION &quot;MORAL AND DIPLOMATIC DISASTER
FROM THE BEGINNING.&quot;  ADVOCATES RESTRAINT OF AID TO
MAKE CLEAR THAT WAR MUST BE BROUGHT TO END THROUGH
POLITICAL ACCOMMODATION.

M. STANTON EVANS, CHAIRMAN OF AMERICAN CONSERVATIVE
UNION, IN LAT (2/9) STATES     &quot;POROUS&quot; C-F MAKES CLEAR
THAT SVN FACES BLATANT COMMUNIST AGGRESSION.  ACCUSES

COMMITMENT OF US FORCES AND GIVE AID TO MOST VIABLE
ANTI-COMMUNIST LEADERSHIP, MEANING THIEU TODAY.
BELIEVES ONLY THING THAT COULD MAKE TRAGEDY WORSE
WOULD BE TO WASH OUR HANDS OF AFFAIR.  THIS WOULD
TRANSMIT MESSAGE OF EXHAUSTION, AND WILL RESULT IN

LOSS OF FRIENDS WHICH AS COMMUNISTS ADVANCE WE WILL
NEED.

LAT'S RESTON (2/9) SEES OLD ARGUMENTS ABOUT VN
INVOLVEMENT FADING UNDER PUBLIC PRESSURE TO END US
&quot;NIGHTMARE&quot; IN INDOCHINA, WITH NOTHING ILLUSTRATING
THIS BETTER THAN MOOD IN CONGRESS.  BELIEVES PRES AND
SECSTATE ARE IN DEEP TROUBLE WITH REQUESTS FOR MORE
FUNDS.  PROBLEM IS THAT PRES AND SECSTATE DEFINE NEED
FOR CONTINUING AID IN TOTALLY DIFFERENT WAY THAN
CONGRESS DOES.  ADMIN IS WARNING CONGRESS TO BEWARE OF
POSSIBLITY OF POLITICAL BACKLASH TO NEGATIVE AID VOTE.
BUT FEW MEMBERS BELIEVE THERE IS POLITICAL MILEAGE
TO BE GAINED FROM ADVOCATING CONTINUING FLOW OF AID
TO SVN.

MARIANNE MEANS (BOST H-A 2/6) SEES &quot;NEGATIVE&quot; POSSIBILITY
FADING FOR SEN JACKSON SINCE KENNEDY HAS BEGUN TO SIGNAL
THAT HE IS NO LONGER ADAMANTLY OPPOSED TO CANDIDACY
FOR PRES.  MEANS ATTRIBUTES THIS LARGELY TO JACKSON'S
CHANGE IN ATTITUDE TOWARD INDOCHINA WAR.  LOFTON
(PHINQ) FINDS &quot;STUNNING REVERSAL&quot; OF JACKSON'S
VIEWS IN RECENT DECLARATION, THAT HE WILL OPPOSE
SUPPLEMENTAL FOR VN.  QUOTES EARLIER, HAWKISH STATEMENTS
BY SENATOR.  BELIEVES JACKSON OWES BOTH US AND VN
PEOPLE FULLER EXPLANATION OF WHY HE HAS NOW JOINED
&quot;CUT AND RUN&quot; CROWD.

IN LETTER TO NYT, O. EDMUND CLUBB FINDS PRES, IN
RECENT STATEMENTS ADVOCATING EXTRA AID TO SVN, HAS

WRITES TO CDN (1/31) THAT INSTEAD OF LOOKING FOR WHAT
WENT WRONG WITH C-F, US WANTS TO GIVE MORE MIL AID
TO &quot;MAIN VIOLATOR&quot; THIEU.  SAYS US HAS MORAL RESPONSI-
BILITY TO GIVE SVN PEOPLE CHANCE TO EXPRESS WILL,
BUT FIRST THIEU MUST GO AND NEW ELECTIONS MUST BE
ARRANGED IN ACCORDANCE WITH C-F.  BELIEVES COMMUNISTS
INSINCERE IN CALLING FOR THIEU OUSTER, SINCE IF HE
GOES CHANGE WOULD BE WELCOMED AND LEAD TO HIGH MORALE
THAT WOULD UNIFY S VIETS.  STATES THAT NEW GOVT MAKING
MOVES TOWARD RECONCILIATION AND PEACE WOULD ATTRACT
MASSIVE SUPPORT AND UNDERMINE VC.  SEES MORE US MIL

AID AS PROLONGING SUFFERING AND RESULTING IN INEVITIBLE
VICTORY FOR COMMUNISTS.

ANTHONY LEWIS (NYT 2/10) IN FIRST OF   SERIES LABELLED
&quot;MR. KISSINGER'S WAR&quot; ASKS WHY HAK IS DOING NOTHING
TO STIMULATE   POLITICAL SOLUTION IN VN.  SAYS THIS
STEMS FROM THIEU'S VIOLATION OF C-F AFTER PARIS
SIGNING, DONE WITH AT LEAST TACIT US APPROVAL.  NOW
BATTLE TIDE SWINGS IN FAVOR OF NVN WHOSE AIMS
STILL LIMITED.  US AID REQUEST IS NEEDED ONLY FOR
PSYCHOLOGICAL PURPOSE TO SHOW CONTINUED US SUPPORT.
WHY DOES HAK CONTINUE TO SUPPORT THIEU IN BLOCKING
POLITICAL SETTLEMENT?  ANSWERS TO COME IN FUTURE
COLUMN, AND EXIST &quot;BEYOND VN.&quot;

JACK ANDERSON (WP 2/9) BASING ON CABLES ALLEGEDLY

NOT MEN REQUIRED.  POINTS TO CONTINUED SVN WILL TO
FIGHT.  SAYS CAUSE OF FREEDOM SERIOUSLY ENDANGERED IF
NO MORE AID FORTHCOMING.

MARY MCGRORY IN GLOBE (2/9) SAYS ROCKY BEWILDERED
BY REACTION TO HIS VN COMMENTS.  HOINTS TO HIS
RELUCTANCE TO GET INVOLVED IN VN DEBATE DURING PAST
10 YEARS.  SAYS CONGRESSIONAL DELEGATION PROPOSED
BY FORD SHOULD MORE APPROPRIATELY LOOK INTO PRESS
FREEDOM IN SVN.

KINGSBURY SMITH IN BOST HERALD-AMERICAN (2/7) DISCUSSES
THOMPSON'S BOOK &quot;PEACE IS NOT AT HAND.&quot;  SAYS NO
AID WOULD BE DISASTER FOR FREE WORLD.  EVENUALLY
COULD LEAD TO ABANDONMENT OF ISRAEL AND STRATEGIC
SURRENDER TO COMMUNISM.

NYT'S LELYVELD, IN HK, OBSERVES THAT FIRST POLITICAL

PROPONENT OF ABOLISHING POST OF CHAIRMAN OF REPUBLIC;
STIPULATION OF WORKERS' CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO

LONG ADVOCATE OF EXPANDED INDUSTRIAL DEMOCRACY.  STIPULA-

BUT SEES F-16, F-17 ALSO IN RUNNING; LATTER'S

TO SVN.

MARIANNE MEANS (BOST H-A 2/6) SEES &quot;NEGATIVE&quot; POSSIBILITY
FADING FOR SEN JACKSON SINCE KENNEDY HAS BEGUN TO SIGNAL
THAT HE IS NO LONGER ADAMANTLY OPPOSED TO CANDIDACY
FOR PRES.  MEANS ATTRIBUTES THIS LARGELY TO JACKSON'S
CHANGE IN ATTITUDE TOWARD INDOCHINA WAR.  LOFTON
(PHINQ) FINDS &quot;STUNNING REVERSAL&quot; OF JACKSON'S
VIEWS IN RECENT DECLARATION, THAT HE WILL OPPOSE
SUPPLEMENTAL FOR VN.  QUOTES EARLIER, HAWKISH STATEMENTS
BY SENATOR.  BELIEVES JACKSON OWES BOTH US AND VN
PEOPLE FULLER EXPLANATION OF WHY HE HAS NOW JOINED
&quot;CUT AND RUN&quot; CROWD.

IN LETTER TO NYT, O. EDMUND CLUBB FINDS PRES, IN
RECENT STATEMENTS ADVOCATING EXTRA AID TO SVN, HAS
&quot;DULLES EVANGELISM SYNDROME&quot; THAT TELLS THOSE
SUFFERING UNDER COMMUNISM THAT THEY CAN COUNT ON US.
RECALLS COMMITMENT TO CCS AND TREATY WITH TAIWAN.  NOTES
THAT WASHINGTON CANNOT ABROGATE TREATY TO ENABLE NORMAL
RELATIONS WITH PRC BECAUSE OF FEAR OF DAMAGE TO

CREDIBILITY.

EXILED LT GEN NGUYEN CHANH THI FROM WASHINGTON
WRITES TO CDN (1/31) THAT INSTEAD OF LOOKING FOR WHAT
WENT WRONG WITH C-F, US WANTS TO GIVE MORE MIL AID
TO &quot;MAIN VIOLATOR&quot; THIEU.  SAYS US HAS MORAL RESPONSI-
BILITY TO GIVE SVN PEOPLE CHANCE TO EXPRESS WILL,
BUT FIRST THIEU MUST GO AND NEW ELECTIONS MUST BE
ARRANGED IN ACCORDANCE WITH C-F.  BELIEVES COMMUNISTS
INSINCERE IN CALLING FOR THIEU OUSTER, SINCE IF HE
GOES CHANGE WOULD BE WELCOMED AND LEAD TO HIGH MORALE
THAT WOULD UNIFY S VIETS.  STATES THAT NEW GOVT MAKING
MOVES TOWARD RECONCILIATION AND PEACE WOULD ATTRACT
MASSIVE SUPPORT AND UNDERMINE VC.  SEES MORE US MIL

AID AS PROLONGING SUFFERING AND RESULTING IN INEVITIBLE
VICTORY FOR COMMUNISTS.

ANTHONY LEWIS (NYT 2/10) IN FIRST OF   SERIES LABELLED
&quot;MR. KISSINGER'S WAR&quot; ASKS WHY HAK IS DOING NOTHING
TO STIMULATE   POLITICAL SOLUTION IN VN.  SAYS THIS
STEMS FROM THIEU'S VIOLATION OF C-F AFTER PARIS
SIGNING, DONE WITH AT LEAST TACIT US APPROVAL.  NOW
BATTLE TIDE SWINGS IN FAVOR OF NVN WHOSE AIMS
STILL LIMITED.  US AID REQUEST IS NEEDED ONLY FOR
PSYCHOLOGICAL PURPOSE TO SHOW CONTINUED US SUPPORT.
WHY DOES HAK CONTINUE TO SUPPORT THIEU IN BLOCKING
POLITICAL SETTLEMENT?  ANSWERS TO COME IN FUTURE
COLUMN, AND EXIST &quot;BEYOND VN.&quot;

JACK ANDERSON (WP 2/9) BASING ON CABLES ALLEGEDLY
STOLEN FROM ELLSBERG BUT NOW IN HANDS OF HOUSE
SUBCOMMITTEE, SAYS JOHNSON ADMINISTRATION BELIEVED
WAR WON IN 1967.  THIS VIEW BASED ON DECEPTION BY
US MILITARY USING HOKED UP DOCUMENTS AND PR
CAMPAIGN.  DOS IS QUOTED AS DOUBTING SAIGON VIEW.
COMPROMISES AGREED TO WHICH WAS THAT TET OFFENSIVE
COULD NEVER HAPPEN.

CDN (2/3) EDIT OPPOSES ADDITIONAL AID TO SVN.  SAYS
VIETS HAVE TO FIND        OWN SOLUTION AND US NEED
UNCLASSIFIED

PAGE 09  STATE  031345

NOT APOLOGIZE BUT SHOULD DEVOTE ITS EFFORTS TO
PROBLEMS IT HAS   CHANCE OF SOLVING.

KILPATRICK IN CDN (2/6) SAYS CONGRESSIONAL RELUCTANCE
ON SUPPLEMENTAL AID IS   FAILURE OF WILL.  ONLY MATERIAL
NOT MEN REQUIRED.  POINTS TO CONTINUED SVN WILL TO
FIGHT.  SAYS CAUSE OF FREEDOM SERIOUSLY ENDANGERED IF
NO MORE AID FORTHCOMING.

MARY MCGRORY IN GLOBE (2/9) SAYS ROCKY BEWILDERED
BY REACTION TO HIS VN COMMENTS.  HOINTS TO HIS
RELUCTANCE TO GET INVOLVED IN VN DEBATE DURING PAST
10 YEARS.  SAYS CONGRESSIONAL DELEGATION PROPOSED
BY FORD SHOULD MORE APPROPRIATELY LOOK INTO PRESS
FREEDOM IN SVN.

KINGSBURY SMITH IN BOST HERALD-AMERICAN (2/7) DISCUSSES
THOMPSON'S BOOK &quot;PEACE IS NOT AT HAND.&quot;  SAYS NO
AID WOULD BE DISASTER FOR FREE WORLD.  EVENUALLY
COULD LEAD TO ABANDONMENT OF ISRAEL AND STRATEGIC
SURRENDER TO COMMUNISM.

8.  CHINA

NYT'S LELYVELD, IN HK, OBSERVES THAT FIRST POLITICAL
PROUNCEMENTS OF PRC'S REALIGNED &quot;AND SUPPOSEDLY
'MODERATE' LEADERSHIP&quot; ARE HEAVILY EMPHASIZING NEED
FOR DISCIPLINE AND SOCIAL ORDER.  BETWEEN LINES,
THEY SEEM SAYING THERE WILL BE LESS ROOM FOR DISSIDENCE
AND DEBATE IN CCP.  POINTS OUT THAT NEW LEADERSHIP
SEEMS TO PUT TWO FORMER ENEMIES, TENG AND CHANG, INTO
SAME HARNESS.  THEIR PRESENT RELATIONS ARE MATTER OF
SPECULATION, BUT RECORD REVEALS SOME &quot;CHOICE&quot; CHANG
REMARKS ABOUT TENG.  REMAINS TO BE SEEN WHETHER
TENG-CHANG LINE IS IN OFFING.

UCLA'S PROF BAUM TAKES EXCEPTION TO SPECULATION IN
US MEDIA THAT RECENT EVENTS IN CHINA PROVE MAO
&quot;HAS HAD IT.&quot;  POINTS OUT THAT CHOU, &quot;FOR ALL HIS
OSTENSIBLE MODERATION AND PRAGMATISM, HAS ALWAYS
BEEN INTENSELY LOYAL&quot; TO CHAIRMAN; NOR IS THERE
UNCLASSIFIED

PAGE 10  STATE  031345

ANY EVIDENCE TENG HSIAO-PING'S RECENT &quot;METEORIC
RISE&quot; OCCURED IN FACE OF MAO'S STRENOUS OPPOSITION.

AS TO NEW CONSTITUTION, BAUM SAYS MAO WAS CHIEF
PROPONENT OF ABOLISHING POST OF CHAIRMAN OF REPUBLIC;
STIPULATION OF WORKERS' CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO
STRIKE MAY ACTUALLY REPRESENT VICTORY FOR AGING MAO,
LONG ADVOCATE OF EXPANDED INDUSTRIAL DEMOCRACY.  STIPULA-
TION THAT PARTY CHAIRMAN SERVE AS PLA COMMANDER-IN CHIEF
CAN ONLY BE INTERPRETED AS NET GAIN FOR MAO.  FINALLY, AT
LAST COUNT THERE WERE NO FEWER THAN NINE ARDENT MAOISTS
SITTING ON 23-MEMBER POLITBURO (FEB 9).

CSM'S POND, IN MOSCOW, CITES FEB 9 PRAVDA ARTICLE
INDICATING SOVIET BELIEF TENG HSIAO-PING WILL NOT
LAST LONG AS CHIEF OF GENERAL STAFF.   POND CAUTIONS
THAT DIFFICULT TO KNOW JUST WHAT MIX OF KREMLIN'S
REAL ANALYSIS, WISHFUL THINKING, AND PUBLIC
PROPAGANDA REFLECTED IN SUCH ARTICLES.

TO SUN'S PARKS, IN MOSCOW, SINO-SOVIET IDEOLOGICAL
BICKERING OVER &quot;WHOSE COMMUNISM IS BETTER,&quot;  STIMULATED
BY NEW PEKING CONSTITUTION, IS MUCH MORE IMPORTANT THAN
MOST SINO-SOVIET QUARRELS OVER LAST 15 YEARS &quot;BECAUSE
IT GREATLY DIMINISHES PROSPECTS&quot; FOR RECONCILIATION.

LAT'S ELEGANT, IN HK, REPORTS BUOYANT, OPTIMISTIC
MOOD IS ABROAD IN PRC AFTER FOURTH NPC; THIS INFO
DERIVED NOT FROM OFFICIAL SOURCES, BUT FROM SPONTANEOUS
REACTION OF CHINESE IN MANY DIFFERENT PARTS OF COUNTRY
AS DEMONSTRATED IN THEIR COMMUNICATIONS TO HK RELATIVES.
CHINESE HIGHLY DEVELOPED ANTENNAE NOW TELLING THEM
BETTER TIMES ARE AHEAD.  MAINLANDERS ASKING FOR MONEY
APPARENTLY BECAUSE THEY'VE SENSED BETTER TIMES AHEAD.
PEKING-SPONSORED ORGANIZATIONS IN HK REFLECT NEW
MOOD.

ELEGANT CITES, UNDER NEW ECONOMIC POLICY, SMALL
HARBINGERS OF FREE ENTERPRISE IN CHINA.  ADDS THAT
EQUALLY IMPORTANT IS FACT NO MAJOR, DISRUPTIVE

PROSPECTIVE VISITSORS BRING ALONG GAILY COLORED CLOTHING.

9.  KOREA

UPI SEOUL (NYDN) SAYS OPPOSITION STEPS UP DRIVE
TO BOYCOTT REFERENDUM WEDNESDAY, IN FACE OF STERN
GOVT WARNINGS.

GLOBE'S STORIN IN SEOUL (2/11) AS HAVE OTHERS,
DESCRIBES DONG-A ILBO SURVIVAL OF ROKG CAMPAIGN
TO CUT AD INCOME; LOSSES MORE THAN MADE UP BY
CASH PAYMENTS FOR SYMPATHY ADS.  NOTES ROKG NOW
ALLOWING PAPERS    PRINT STATEMENTS BY KIM YOUNG
SAM, KIM DAE JUNG, PERHAPS TO IMPROVE REFERENDUM
IMAGE.  BUT ADDS MOST OBSERVERS BELIEVE PARK WOULD
WIN FAIR ELECTION, WITH ALMOST TOTAL SUPPORT OF
45 PERCENT OF POPULATION IN RURAL CONSERVATIVE
AREAS.

LAT'S JAMESON IN TOKYO (2/10) STATES NK, WHICH
BOASTED CURRENT SIX-YEAR PLAN AHEAD OF SCHEDULE,
NOW REHORTED IN DEFAULT OF PAYMENTS OF LOANS TO
FINANCE TRADE. CITES JAPANESE TRADING FIRM OFFICIAL,
RECENTLY IN PYONGYANG, THAT JAPAN HALTED STEEL
EXPORTS TO NK IN JULY WHEN NK FAILED TO PAY OFF
LETTERS OF CREDIT DISCOUNTED TO LEADING BANKS IN
EUROPE.  OPINES OIL CRISIS TOOK SEVERE TOLL IN NK.
NOTES NK MAY HAVE DIVERTED IRON ORE, DESTINED FOR
JAPAN, TO LHINA TO PAY FOR OIL; SPECULATES RESULTING
50 PERCENT SHORTFALL IN EXPORTS TO JAPAN COMPOUNDED
NK DEBT SERVICE PROBLEM.  ALSO CITES &quot;HIGH-POWERED&quot;
GOJ SOURCE THAT EXIM BANK WOULD GIVE ONLY &quot;SPARING&quot;

AND &quot;WELL-SPACED&quot; APPROVAL TO &quot;HOST&quot; OF NK APPLICATIONS
FOR LOANS TO FINANCE TRADE, TO AVOID EXACERBATING
RELATIONS WITH JAPAN'S SECOND-BEST TRADING PARTNER,
ROK.

SUN'S STORIN IN TOKYO (2/9) NOTES JAPAN ABOUT TO
BEGIN SEARCH FOR NEW GENERATION SUPERSONIC FIGHTER
TO REPLACE F-104, WHICH LIKELY TO SET PLANE MAKERS
&quot;DROOLING.&quot;  SOME AIR DEFENSE OFFICIALS ALREADY
IMPRESSED BY F-15 CAPABILITY, ESPECIALLY IN AIR-TO-
AIR COMBAT AGAINST MIG-25; BUT DOVES IN DIET SEEN
LEERY OF UNCONSTITUTIONAL OFFENSIVE CAPABILITY
IMPLICIT IN ITS LONG RANGE, AS WELL AS COST.  SAYS
F-15 MAKER, MCDONNELL-DOUGLAS, REPRESENTED IN TOKYO
BY FORMER COMMANDER OF US FORCES, JAPAN, RETIRED
USAF LT GEN GORDON GRAHAM.

BUT SEES F-16, F-17 ALSO IN RUNNING; LATTER'S
SELECTION WOULD ENHANCE COMPATIBILITY OF FORCES
SOUGHT BY US, SINCE USAF HAS ALREADY PICKED F-17
AS ITS &quot;LIGHTWEIGHT&quot; FIGHTER.  ANOTHER FACTOR IN
CHOICE IS GOJ WISH TO ASSEMBLE PLANE IN JAPAN TO
BENEFIT ECONOMY, ACQUIRE TECHNOLOGY.  ASDF TEAMS
TO STUDY CHOICES AVAILABLE IN US AND EUROPE THIS
SUMMER, RECOMMEND CHOICE OF NEW FIGHTER IN 1976,
FOR DEPLOYMENT IN 1979.  HOWEVER, ACCORDING STORIN,
EXPENSIVE AIRCRAFT PROCUREMENT, AT TIME MIKI STRESSING
HIGH PRIORITY OF SOCIAL INVESTMENT, COULD REKINDLE
KIND OF BASIC ARGUMENT ABOUT DEFENSE WHICH MARKED
EARLY 1960S.

NYT SPECIAL (TOKYO) SAYS MIYAZAWA STATEMENT IN DIET
MONDAY AGAIN BACKS GOJ AWAY FROM NHT RATIFICATION,
REVERSES EARLIER MIKI PLEDGE TO RATIFY THIS SESSION
OF DIET.  FM SAID MORE TIME NEEDED TO STUDY TREATY,
AND PROPOSED NUCLEAR INSPECTION AGREEMENT WITH IAEA.
NOTES LDP FOREIGN AFFAIRS, SECURITY COMMITTEE MEMBERS
OPPOSED NPT OVER WEEKEND, ON GROUNDS FRANCE, CHINA
HAVE NOT SIGNED.  SAYS US, OTHER NATIONS EXERTING &quot;QUIET
PRESSURE&quot; ON GOJ TO RATIFY SINCE INDIAN TEST.

FICATION, SINCE SIGNING NPT 1970: PROGRESS TOWARD

JAPAN SEES PROGRESS ONLY ON THIRD CONDITION, WITH
NEGOTIATIONS IN VIENNA MOVING TOWARD IAEA AGREEMENT
TO INSPECT JAPAN UNDER SAME STANDARDS APPLIED TO
OTHER COUNTRIES.  BUT ADDS MANY JAPANESE, LEFT AND
RIGHT, CONSIDER NPT &quot;UNEQUAL TREATY,&quot; AND GOJ DOES
NOT CONCEAL DESIRE TO BECOME UNSEC PERMANENT MEMBER,
TO GAIN EQUAL STANDING WITH FIVE PERMANENT MEMBER
