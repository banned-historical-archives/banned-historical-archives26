		<h3>Tor</h3>
		<p><a href="https://www.torproject.org">Tor</a> is an encrypted anonymising network that makes it harder to intercept internet communications, or see where communications are coming from or going to.</p>
		<p>In order to use the WikiLeaks public submission system as detailed above you can download the Tor Browser Bundle, which is a Firefox-like browser available for Windows, Mac OS X and GNU/Linux and pre-configured to connect using the anonymising system Tor.</p>
		<h4>Tails</h4>
		<p>If you are at high risk and you have the capacity to do so, you can also access the submission system through a secure operating system called <a href="https://tails.boum.org">Tails</a>. Tails is an operating system launched from a USB stick or a DVD that aim to leaves no traces when the computer is shut down after use and automatically routes your internet traffic through Tor. Tails will require you to have either a USB stick or a DVD at least 4GB big and a laptop or desktop computer.</p>

		<h3>Tips</h3>
		<p>Our submission system works hard to preserve your anonymity, but we recommend you also take some of your own precautions. Please review these basic guidelines. </p>
		<div>
			<h4>1. Contact us if you have specific problems</h4>
			<p>If you have a very large submission, or a submission with a complex format, or are a high-risk source, please <a href="#submit_help_contact">contact us</a>. In our experience it is always possible to find a custom solution for even the most seemingly difficult situations.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h4>2. What computer to use</h4>
			<p>If the computer you are uploading from could subsequently be audited in an investigation, consider using a computer that is not easily tied to you. Technical users can also use <a href="https://tails.boum.org">Tails</a> to help ensure you do not leave any records of your submission on the computer.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h4>3. Do not talk about your submission to others</h4>
			<p>If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in source protection – it is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This includes other media organisations.</p>
		</div>

	</div>

		<h3>After</h3>

		<div>
			<h4>1. Do not talk about your submission to others</h4>
			<p>If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in source protection – it is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This includes other media organisations.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h4>2. Act normal</h4>
			<p>If you are a high-risk source, avoid saying anything or doing anything after submitting which might promote suspicion. In particular, you should try to stick to your normal routine and behaviour.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h4>3. Remove traces of your submission</h4>
			<p>If you are a high-risk source and the computer you prepared your submission on, or uploaded it from, could subsequently be audited in an investigation, we recommend that you format and dispose of the computer hard drive and any other storage media you used.</p>
			<p>In particular, hard drives retain data after formatting which may be visible to a digital forensics team and flash media (USB sticks, memory cards and SSD drives) retain data even after a secure erasure. If you used flash media to store sensitive data, it is important to destroy the media.</p>
			<p>If you do this and are a high-risk source you should make sure there are no traces of the clean-up, since such traces themselves may draw suspicion.</p>
			<div>
				<h4>4. If you face legal action</h4>
				<p>If a legal action is brought against you as a result of your submission, there are organisations that may help you. The Courage Foundation is an international organisation dedicated to the protection of journalistic sources. You can find more details at <a href="https://www.couragefound.org">https://www.couragefound.org</a>.</p>

		<p>WikiLeaks publishes documents of political or historical importance that are censored or otherwise suppressed. We specialise in strategic global publishing and large archives.</p>
		<p>The following is the address of our secure site where you can anonymously upload your documents to WikiLeaks editors. You can only access this submissions system through Tor. (See our <a href="#submit_help_tor">Tor tab</a> for more information.) We also advise you to read our <a href="#submit_help_tips">tips for sources</a> before submitting.</p>

			<!--<div>
				Copy this address into your Tor browser. Advanced users, if they wish, can also add a further layer of encryption to their submission using <a href="#submit_wlkey">our public PGP key</a>.
			</div>-->
		</div>

		<p>If you cannot use Tor, or your submission is very large, or you have specific requirements, WikiLeaks provides several alternative methods. <a href="#submit_help_contact">Contact us</a> to discuss how to proceed.</p>

POLITICAL ANALYSIS: CHINA AT THE UNCSTD: A PRE-CONFERENCE
POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC PROFILE
1. BEGIN SUMMARY. THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA (PRC)
CAN BE EXPECTED TO ASSUME A LOW PROFILE AT THE UN CONFER-

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
ENCE ON SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY FOR DEVELOPMENT, TO BE HELD
IN VIENNA IN AUGUST-SEPTEMBER 1979, AND IN THE PREPARATORY
MEETINGS PRECEDING THE CONFERENCE. COMMITTED TO ITS OWN
POLICY OF RAPID INDUSTRIALIZATION AND MODERNIZATION,
CHINA WILL, IN GENERAL, SUPPORT THIRD WORLD DEMANDS FOR
IMPROVED ACCESS TO WESTERN TECHNOLOGY. IN ALL LIKELIHOOD,
HOWEVER, ITS ACTION AT THE CONFERENCE WILL BE LIMITED TO
MORAL AND BALLOT SUPPORT.
2. DESPITE ITS CONSIDERABLE POTENTIAL FOR INFLUENCE AND
LEADERSHIP AMONG THE LDCS, CHINA DOES NOT WISH TO BE SEEN
AS BEING MOTIVATED BY A DESIRE TO IMPOSE ITS WILL ON OTHER
COUNTRIES. IT ALSO WISHES TO AVOID INVOLVEMENT IN THIRD
WORLD CONTROVERSIES AS WELL AS COMMITMENTS THAT RESTRICT
ITS ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL FREEDOM OF ACTION. IT CAN BE
EXPECTED, HOWEVER, TO ENGAGE IN SHARP AND ACRIMONIOUS
CLASHES WITH THE SOVIET UNION DURING THE UNCSTD.
END SUMMARY.
3. FOREIGN POLICY
4. THE CORNERSTONE OF CHINA'S FOREIGN POLICY IS CONTAINCONFIDENTIAL
PAGE 03

STATE 238846

MENT OF SOVIET INFLUENCE THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. TO THIS
END, PEKING ADVOCATES A &quot;UNITED FRONT&quot; OF ALL THIRD WORLD
COUNTRIES.
5. THE SINO-SOVIET DISPUTE--WHICH OSTENSIBLY BEGAN OVER
IDEOLOGICAL DIFFERENCES IN 1960--HAS EVOLVED INTO SEEMINGLY IMPLACABLE HOSTILITY. PEKING VIEWS THE SOVIET
UNION AS THE WORLD'S MOST AMBITIOUS PRACTITIONER OF
COLONIALISM AND THE SOURCE OF AN &quot;INEVITABLE&quot; THIRD WORLD
WAR. AS SUCH, THE USSR IS SEEN AS POSING A DIRECT AND
LONG-TERM THREAT TO CHINA'S SECURITY.
6. THE PERCEIVED SOVIET THREAT HAS LED CHINA TO SEEK
CLOSER RELATIOSWITH THE WEST, PRESSING FOR STRONGER
MEASURES TO RESIST SOVIET EXPANSIONISM. IN THIS CONTEXT,
CHINA CONTINUES TO URGE, FOR EXAMPLE, THAT NATO BE EXPANDED
AND STRENGTHENED. PEKING EVEN GOES SO FAR AS TO APPLAUD
WESTERN INVOLVEMENT IN FORMER COLONIAL AREAS WHENEVER IT
CONSIDERS THAT SUCH INVOLVEMENT WOULD INHIBIT THE GROWTH
OF SOVIET INFLUENCE.
7. THE PRC'S RAPIDLY DEVELOPING ECONOMIC RELATIONS WITH
THE INDUSTRIALIZED WEST HAVE BEEN ONE OF THE MAJOR ELEMENTS
OF CHINA'S ECONOMIC AND FOREIGN POLICIES SINCE THE DEATH
OF MAO TSE-TUNG AND THE PURGE OF HIS LEFTIST FOLLOWERS
IN 1976. CHINA IS COUNTING ON IMPROVED RELATIONS WITH THE
INDUSTRIALIZED WEST TO FACILITATE A LARGE-SCALE TRANSFER

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
OF ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY WHICH IT HOPES WILL STIMULATE AND
AUGMENT INDIGENOUS EFFORTS TO DEVELOP A FULLY MODERNIZED
ECONOMY BY THE END OF THE CENTURY. IN PURSUIT OF DEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVES, CHINA SIGNED TRADE, AND SCIENTIFIC AND
TECHNICAL AGREEMENTS WITH JAPAN (WORTH MORE THAN DOLS 10
BILLION) AND WEST EUROPEAN COUNTRIES DURING THE FIRST HALF
OF 1978.
8. SINCE THE LATE 1960S, PEKING HAS SOUGHT TO EXPAND ITS
CONFIDENTIAL
PAGE 04

STATE 238846

OPTIONS IN VARIOUS FOREIGN POLICY AREAS AND ISSUES BY
CAUTIOUSLY RELAXING SOME OF CHINA'S IDEOLOGICAL STRICTURES
AS WELL AS ITS HISTORIC SELF-CENTEREDNESS. THE PRC,
HOWEVER, REMAINS FIERCELY COMMITTED TO ITS LONGSTANDING
PRINCIPLES OF POLITICAL SELF-DETERMINATION AND ECONOMIC
SELF-RELIANCE. PEKING CONSISTENTLY AVOIDS STEPS THAT
WOULD SUBSTANTIALLY INCREASE CHINA'S POLITICAL OR ECONOMIC DEPENDENCE ON OTHER COUNTRIES.
9. CHINA IN THE INTERNATIONAL ARENA
10. SINCE ITS ADMISSION TO THE UNITED NATIONS IN 1971,
CHINA HAS PROCLAIMED ITSELF A SPOKESMAN FOR THE DEVELOPING
COUNTRIES AND HAS BEEN A CRITIC OF THE TWO SUPERPOWERS-ESPECIALLY THE SOVIET UNION. HOPING THAT CONFLICT BETWEEN
THE SUPERPOWERS AND THE THIRD WORLD MIGHT CREATE OPENINGS
THAT WOULD ENHANCE CHINA'S OWN INFLUENCE AND PRESTIGE,
PEKING USES EVERY OPPORTUNITY TO SUPPORT THE THIRD WORLD
LINE AND BLAME THE SOVIET UNION AND THE UNITED STATES FOR
ALL GLOBAL INEQUITIES. RHETORIC DIRECTED AGAINST THE
SOVIET UNION CAN BE PARTICULARLY VIRULENT AND DISRUPTIVE.
11. THE PRC BACKS ITS MORAL SUPPORT FOR THE DEVELOPING
COUNTRIES BY VOTING A STRAIGHT THIRD WORLD TICKET WHEN BLOC
VOTING TAKES PLACE. THE ONLY EXCEPTIONS OCCUR WHEN CHINESE
NATIONAL INTERESTS MIGHT BE COMPROMISED DIRECTLY. AT THESE
TIMES, THE PRC GENERALLY DECLINES TO VOTE ON THE GROUNDS OF
&quot;IDEOLOGICAL OR POLITICAL PRINCIPLE.&quot;
12. IN CONTRAST WITH ITS UNFAILING ATTENDANCE AT FULLDRESS UN CONFERENCES AND SPECIAL SESSIONS, PEKING HAS
ADOPTED A LOW-PROFILE, HIGHLY SELECTIVE APPROACH TO PARTICIPATION IN THE UN'S COMMITTEES AND SPECIALIZED ORGANIZATIONS. POLITICAL AND IDEOLOGICAL CRITERIA, SELF-INTEREST,

PAGE 05

STATE 238846

AND LIMITATIONS ON THE NUMBER OF TRAINED PERSONNEL AVAILABLE FOR ASSIGNMENT ABROAD ALL INFLUENCE THESE DECISIONS.
13. CHINA USES ITS PRINCIPLE OF NON-INTERFERENCE IN THE

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
INTERNAL AFFAIRS OF OTHERS, FOR EXAMPLE, TO EXPLAIN ITS
REFUSAL TO JOIN OR PROVIDE FINANCIAL SUPPORT FOR ANY OF THE
UN ORGANS INVOLVED IN PEACEKEEPING ACTIVITIES. DECISIONS
TO JOIN THE UN ECONOMIC, SCIENTIFIC AND CULTURAL ORGANIZATION (UNESCO) AND THE FOOD AND AGRICULTURE ORGANIZATION
(FAO), ON THE OTHER HAND, PROBABLY WERE BASED ON THE DESIRE
FOR EASIER ACCESS TO WESTERN SCIENTIFIC INFORMATION. THE
NEED FOR IMPORTED TECHNOLOGY CAN BE OVERRIDDEN, HOWEVER,
WHEN PEKING FEELS THAT THE PRICE IS TOO HIGH--AS IN ITS
DECISION NOT TO SURRENDER ITS &quot;SOVEREIGNTY&quot; IN THE
DEVELOPMENT OF NUCLEAR RESOURCES BY JOINING THE INTERNATIONAL ATOMIC ENERGY AGENCY (IAEA).
14. THERE IS A STRIKING CONTRAST BETWEEN CHINA'S PURPOSEFULLY LOUD AND ABRASIVE RHETORIC DURING GENERAL DEBATE AND
ITS LOW-KEY APPROACH TO WORKING-LEVEL DELIBERATIONS AND
BEHIND-THE-SCENES LOBBYING. EXCEPT IN THE CASE OF THE
UN SECURITY COUNCIL, IN WHICH MEMBERS ARE OBLIGED TO
ASSUME THE PRESIDENCY ON A ROTATING BASIS, CHINESE
REPRESENTATIVES HAVE NEITHER SOUGHT THE CHAIRMANSHIP OF
ANY COMMITTEES OR SUBSIDIARY BODIES OF THE UN NOR SERVED
WHEN ASKED. AS COMMITTEE MEMBERS, THE CHINESE ARE
GENERALLY UP-TO-DATE ON THE TOPICS AT HAND AND DESIROUS OF
ADVANCING THEIR OWN KNOWLEDGE. UNLESS THEY HAVE CRITICAL
NATIONAL INTERESTS TO PURSUE, HOWEVER, THE CHINESE SELDOM
PROVIDE RELEVANT INFORMATION OR OFFER CONSTRUCTIVE IDEAS
TO THE GROUP.
15. ONLY WHEN PURSUING SPECIFIC NATIONAL INTERESTS OR,
MORE FREQUENTLY, WHEN THERE IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO CONFRONT
THE SOVIETS, DOES PEKING ASSUME AN AGGRESSIVE STANCE IN
UN COMMITTEES AND AFFILIATED ORGANIZATIONS. AGAIN, ATTACKS

ON THE SOVIETS ARE OFTEN INTENSE ENOUGH TO CONFOUND
SEVERELY COMMITTEE PROCEEDINGS.
16. CHINESE UNWILLINGNESS TO PARTICIPATE IN SUBSTANTIVE
PROCEEDINGS AT BOTH FORMAL AND INFORMAL LEVELS EVEN
EXTENDS TO AVOIDANCE OF DEVELOPING-COUNTRY ACTIVITIES.
PEKING HAS,FOR EXAMPLE, DECLINED PRC MEMBERSHIP IN THE .
GROUP OF 77 AND HAS REFUSED ANY ROLE IN THE GROUP'S EFFORTS
TO CREATE A NEW INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC ORDER (NIEO).
CHINA'S MEMBERSHIP IN THE ASIAN GROUP--ONE OF THE UN'S
FIVE OFFICIALLY RECOGNIZED CAUCUSING GROUPS--IS ONLY
NOMINAL. FURTHERMORE, CHINA IS NOT A MEMBER OF THE
NON-ALIGNED MOVEMENT AND HAS REFUSED AN INVITATION TO
JOIN THE COALITION OF COASTAL STATES AT THE LAW OF THE
SEA FORUMS.
17. PEKING'S DISINCLINATION TO TAKE AN ACTIVE ROLE IN
THIRD WORLD ORGANIZATIONS IS PROBABLY DUE LARGELY TO THE

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
IMAGE CHINA WISHES TO MAINTAIN OF NOT ACTING AS A SUPERPOWER BY IMPOSING ITS WILL ON OTHERS. ITS RELUCTANCE TO
BECOME EMBROILED IN THE INTRA-BLOC CONTROVERSIES OF THE
DEVELOPING COUNTRIES AS WELL AS ITS DESIRE TO AVOID
FINANCIALLY EXPENSIVE AND POLITICALLY RESTRICTIVE COMMITMENTS ALSO ACT AS DISINCENTIVES TO MEMBERSHIP IN
SPECIALIZED GROUPS.
18. THE POST-MAO LEADERSHIP'S MORE OPEN AND PRAGMATIC
APPROACH TO FOREIGN POLICY IS NOW ALLOWING SLIGHTLY MORE
ACTIVE PARTICIPATION IN UN-SPONSORED PROJECTS. THIS YEAR,
FOR THE FIRST TIME, STUDY GROUPS FROM THE FOOD AND
AGRICULTURE ORGANIZATION AND THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION
WERE ABLE TO VISIT THE PRC. STILL, SUCH CHANGES HAVE

SUPPORT OF THIRD WORLD INTERESTS.
19. ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT
20. CHINESE ECONOMIC GROWTH WAS SERIOUSLY DISRUPTED BY THE
TRAUMAS OF 1976, AMONG THEM: POLITICAL UPHEAVAL (CAUSED BY
THE DEATHS OF CHINA'S TOP LEADERS AND A MAJOR SUCCESSION
STRUGGLE) THAT CONTRIBUTED TO WIDESPREAD LABOR UNREST, AND
A SHATTERING EARTHQUAKE THAT LEFT THREE-QUARTERS OF A
MILLION DEAD AND DEVASTATED ONE OF CHINA'S MOST IMPORTANT
INDUSTRIAL AREAS. CHINA'S GROSS NATIONAL PRODUCT (GNP)
HAS BEEN ESTIMATED AT ABOUT DOLS 323 BILLION (1976 US DOLS)
IN 1975 AND DOLS 340 BILLION IN 1976. BY THE END OF 1977,
HOWEVER, ECONOMIC GROWTH RESUMED AS CHINA BEGAN TO RECOVER
FROM THE CHAOS AND STAGNATION OF THE PREVIOUS YEAR. THE
LEADERSHIP THAT HAS EMERGED SINCE MAO'S DEATH HAS PLACED
HIGHEST PRIORITY ON RESTORING THE ECONOMY AND MODERNIZING
CHINA BY THE YEAR 2000.
21. TO ACCOMPLISH THIS GOAL, PEKING HAS SET FORTH A 10YEAR PLAN (1976-85) THAT IS INTENDED TO CONSOLIDATE THE
ECONOMY AND ESTBLISH THE BASIS FOR MODERNIZATION IN THE
ENSUING 15 YEARS. THE KEY FEATURES OF THIS PLAN INCLUDE:
(A)--ACHIEVEMENT OF 85-PERCENT MECHANIZATION OF AGRICULTURE, WITH AGRICULTURAL OUTPUT TO INCREASE BY 4-5 PERCENT
ANNUALLY, AND GRAIN PRODUCTION TO REACH 400 MILLION METRIC
TONS (MMT) PER YEAR BY 1985 (COMPARED WITH AN ESTIMATED
280 MMT FOR 1977);
(B)--EXPANSION OF INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION AT AN ANNUAL RATE
OF 10 PERCENT, WITH ANNUAL STEEL PRODUCTION ALMOST
TRIPLING BETWEEN 1978 AND 1985;

(C)--CONSOLIDATION OF THE ECONOMY THROUGH COMPLETION OF
120 LARGE INDUSTRIAL COMPLEXES&quot; AND THE ORGANIZATION OF
&quot;14 INDUSTRIAL BASES&quot; AND &quot;SIX ECONOMIC REGIONS&quot;;
WITH GREATER CONTROL RETURNING TO THE CENTRAL AUTHORITIES;
AND
(E)--A REDUCTION IN POPULATION INCREASE FROM THE CURRENT
(ESTIMATED) ANNUAL RATE OF 1.6 PERCENT TO LESS THAN
1 PERCENT BY 1980.
22. ALL OF THESE GOALS ARE VERY AMBITIOUS. CONSEQUENTLY,
PEKING HAS GIVEN ALMOST UNPRECEDENTED ATTENTION TO THE
PIVOTAL ROLE THAT SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY MUST PLAY IN
CHINA'S DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS. IN MARCH 1978, PEKING CONVENED A NATIONAL SCIENCE CONFERENCE TO FORMALIZE PLANS FOR
COMPREHENSIVE REORGANIZATION AND REDIRECTION OF SCIENTIFIC
AND TECHNOLOGICAL WORK. MAJOR CHANGES ARE UNDER WAY
THAT WILL REMOVE MANY OF THE POLITICAL AND IDEOLOGICAL
CONSTRAINTS IMPOSED ON SCIENCE DURING AND SINCE THE
CULTURAL REVOLUTION IN THE LATE 1960S.
23. PEKING IS NOW ADVOCATING BETTER TREATMENT OF
SCIENTISTS AND EDUCATORS, INCLUDING REVERSAL OF PAST
NEGATIVE ATTITUDES TOWARD THEM, IMPROVEMENT OF THEIR
LIVING AND WORKING CONDITIONS, AND SOME INCREASES IN
MATERIAL BENEFITS.
24. EDUCATIONAL RECRUITMENT POLICIES ARE BEING OVERHAULED
TO PUT GREATER STRESS ON ACADEMIC RATHER THAN POLITICAL
QUALIFICATIONS, AND CHANGES IN CURRICULA ARE BEING MADE.
THE LEADERSHIP HAS ALSO REAFFIRMED THE CRITICAL IMPORTANCE
OF FOREIGN TECHNOLOGY TO ITS PLANS. IT CLEARLY HOPES TO

IMPORTS OF ADVANCED EQUIPMENT AND WHOLE PLANTS AND BY
INCREASING THE NUMBER AND TYPES OF TECHNICAL AND SCIENTIFIC
EXCHANGE PROGRAMS WITH ADVANCED COUNTRIES, INCLUDING THE
UNITED STATES.
25. BALANCE OF PAYMENTS AND TRADE: MERCHANDISE TRADE
ACCOUNTS FOR THE VAST BULK OF CHINA'S BALANCE OF PAYMENTS
RELATIVE TO OTHER NATIONS. THE PRC HAS RELIED VERY LITTLE
ON FOREIGN TRADE, MAINTAINING LEVELS AT LESS THAN 5 PERCENT
OF ITS GNP. CHINA'S FOREIGN TRADE, NONETHELESS, HELPS TO
PAY FOR SUCH ESSENTIAL IMPORTS AS GRAIN AND OTHER AGRI-

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
CULTURAL PRODUCTS, METALS, MACHINERY, AND WHOLE PLANTS.
CHINA'S NEW LEADERSHIP IS NOW PROCLAIMING THAT IMPORTED
TECHNOLOGY IS &quot;ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL&quot; TO ACHIEVING ITS
DECLARED GOAL OF &quot;MODERNIZATION BY THE END OF THE CENTURY.&quot;
26. PEKING SEEKS BALANCE IN ITS OVERALL TRADE. DURING THE
1960S, CHINA'S ANNUAL TRADE HELD STEADY AT AROUND DOLS 4
BILLION, RUNNING SURPLUSES OF BETWEEN DOLS 5 MILLION AND
DEFICIT OF DOLS 70 MILLION. AFTER THE CULTURAL REVOLUTION,
PEKING ADOPTED A MORE OUTWARD-LOOKING APPROACH TO ECONOMIC
MODERNIZATION, MAKING LARGE PURCHASES FROM THE WEST OF
COMPLETE PLANTS, MACHINERY, AIRCRAFT, SHIPS, METALS, AND
FERTILIZER. STRAINED BY THESE EXPENDITURES, PEKING'S
EXPORTS--ALTHOUGH EXPANDING--COULD NOT KEEP UP WITH IMPORTS
IN 1973-75. IN 1974, UNUSUALLY HIGH IMPORTS OF GRAIN AND
COTTON RESULTED IN A RECORD DEFICIT OF ALMOST DOLS 800
MILLION. REDUCED IMPORTS CUT THE TRADE DEFICIT SHARPLY
IN THE FOLLOWING YEARS, AND RESULTED IN SURPLUSES OF OVER
DOLS 1 BILLION IN BOTH 1976 AND 1977.
27. WITH MORE THAN 80 PERCENT OF ITS FOREIGN TRADE CONDUCTED WITH NON-COMMUNIST TRADERS, THE PRC DEPENDS LESS
UPON SOCIALIST TRADING PARTNERS THAN DOES ANY OTHER
CONFIDENTIAL

STATE 238846

COMMUNIST COUNTRY. JAPAN IS THE PRC'S LEADING TRADING
PARTNER (23 PERCENT IN 1976), FOLLOWED BY WESTERN EUROPE
(20.1 PERCENT IN 1976). IMPORTS OF PLANTS, TECHNOLOGY,
AND EQUIPMENT FROM THESE COUNTRIES AS WELL AS FROM THE
UNITED STATES ARE EXPECTED TO INCREASE SUBSTANTIALLY OVER
THE COMING YEARS IN ACCORDANCE WITH HINA'S PLANS FOR
RAPID MODERNIZATION. PEKING HOPES TO PAY FOR THESE
INCREASED IMPORTS THROUGH EXPANDED EXPORTS, ESPECIALLY OF
PETROLEUM AND COAL. EXPORT EARNINGS FROM THESE TWO
INDUSTRIES, HOWEVER, MAY NOT BE AS GREAT AS IS HOPED.
PRODUCTION GAINS WILL BE INCREASINGLY CONSUMED BY GROWING
DOMESTIC NEED, WHILE THE POOR QUALITY OF MUCH OF CHINA'S
PETROLEUM AND COKING COAL RESERVES REDUCES THEIR
MARKETABILITY.
28. FOREIGN DEBT: CHINA'S INSISTENCE ON SELF-RELIANCE
HAS RESULTED IN A DEEPLY INGRAINED
ELUCTANCE TO GO INTO
DEBT. AS A RESULT, PEKING HAS CONSISTENTLY REFUSED TO
.
ACCEPT DIRECT GOVERNMENT OR GOVERNMENT-GUARANTEED CREDITS
FROM FOREIGN COUNTRIES. IT HAS, HOWEVER, ACCEPTED VARIOUS
FORMS OF SUPPLIER CREDITS TIED TO SPECIFIC PURCHASES, AND
DEPOSITS (ONLY SHORT-TERM UNTIL RECENTLY) OF FOREIGN
CURRENCIES WITH BRANCHES OF THE BANK OF CHINA.
29. THROUGH THESE KINDS OF CREDITS, CHINA'S DEBT HAS GROWN

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
CONSIDERABLY DURING THE 1970S. PRIMARILY BECAUSE OF THE
USE OF CREDIT FOR COMPLETE PLANT AND AGRICULTURAL PURCHASES
IN 1973 AND 1974, THE PRC'S DEBT SERVICE RATIO ROSE FROM
4 PERCENT IN 1973 TO A HIGH OF 23 PERCENT IN 1976. BY THE
END OF 1976, OUTSTANDING EXTERNAL LIABILITIES TOTALED
ABOUT DOLS 2 BILLION. (TOTAL GOLD AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE
RESERVES HAVE BEEN ESTIMATED AT DOLS 3-4 BILLION.)
CONFIDENTIAL
PAGE 11

STATE 238846

TO ACCEPT--A GREATER VARIETY OF CREDITS THAN IT HAD IN THE
PAST IN ORDER TO FACILITATE IMPORTS OF NEEDED TECHNOLOGY,
WHOLE PLANTS, AND EQUIPMENT. YET, EVEN THOUGH THE DEBT
SERVICE RATIO CAN BE EXPECTED TO RISE IN THE COMING YEARS,
IT IS CLEAR THAT THE CHINESE INTEND TO CONTINUE RESTRAINT
IN BORROWING. IT IS UNLIKELY THAT THE PRC WILL ALLOW ITS
DEBT SERVICE RATIO TO GO MUCH HIGHER THAN ITS 1976 LEVEL.
31. OUTLOOK: WHETHER CHINA CAN EVENTUALLY SUCCEED IN
BUILDING A POWERFUL, MODERN STATE WILL DEPEND IN LARGE
MEASURE ON THE ABILITY OF THE PRESENT, MODERATE REGIME
TO CREATE A STABLE POLITICAL CLIMATE AND MOBILIZE CHINA'S
AMPLE HUMAN AND NATURAL RESOURCES. SUBSTANTIAL SHORTFALLS
IN MEETING THE AMBITIOUS GOALS THAT PEKING HAS SET FOR THE
NEXT EIGHT YEARS WOULD MEAN A SERIOUS SETBACK FOR PEKING'S
LONG-TERM PLANS, AND COULD THREATEN THE POLITICAL LONGEVITY
OF THOSE IN THE CURRENT REGIME WHO HAVE BEEN WILLING TO
SACRIFICE MAOIST ORTHODOXY IN THE NAME OF RAPID DEVELOPMENT.
32. LIKELY CHINESE ATTITUDES AT THE UNCSTD
33. WHILE THERE MAY BE SOME INTENSE VERBAL DUELING BETWEEN
THE CHINESE AND THE SOVIETS, PEKING WILL PROBABLY ADOPT A
PASSIVE APPROACH TO THE SUBSTANTIVE PROCEEDINGS AT THE
UNCSTD. MORAL AND BALLOT SUPPORT FOR THE THIRD WORLD LINE
IN GENERAL WILL BE OFFERED. WHEN THE PRC POSITION DOES NOT
COINCIDE WITH THAT LINE, THE CHINESE WILL PROBABLY REFRAIN
FROM VOTING.
34. FOOD AND AGRICULTURE: ACCORDING TO THE CHINESE,
GLOBAL FOOD SUP LY PROBLEMS ARE THE RESULT OF SUPERPOWER .
&quot;EXPLOITATION&quot; OF THE DEVELOPING COUNTRIES. NATIONAL
&quot;SELF-RELIANCE,&quot; IN THEIR VIEW, IS THE ONLY REAL SOLUTION.
DESPITE ITS FREQUENT LARGESCALE PURCHASES OF GRAIN, PEKING

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
35. NATURAL RESOURCES: CHINA STRONGLY SUPPORTS THE RIGHT
OF EVERY STATE TO EXERCISE SOVEREIGNTY OVER ITS NATURAL
RESOURCES. CONSEQUENTLY, IT HAS RESISTED DIRECT FOREIGN
INVESTMENT IN THE PRC AND HAS DECLINED MEMBERSHIP IN INTERNATIONAL REGULATORY AGENCIES, SUCH AS THE INTERNATIONAL
ATOMIC ENERGY AGENCY. ENERGY RESOURCES HAVE BEEN OF
PARTICULAR CONCERN TO THE CHINESE; PEKING SUPPORTS OPEC AND
OTHER DEVELOPING-COUNTRY PRODUCER GROUPINGS, BUT IT HAS
MADE NO EFFORTS TO JOIN THEM.
36. TRANSFER OF TECHNOLOGY: WITH ITS CURRENT EMPHASIS ON
A MAJOR ROLE FOR IMPORTED PLANT AND TECHNOLOGY IN CHINA'S
DEVELOPMENT, PEKING VIEWS SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY AS THE
&quot;COMMON WEALTH OF MANKIND.&quot; ACCORDINGLY, THE PRC IS A
STRONG SUPPORTER OF TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER BY THE DEVELOPED
COUNTRIES TO THE LDCS.
37. HEALTH AND QUALITY OF LIFE: WHILE TAKING PRECAUTIONS
TO PROTECT THEIR OWN ENVIRONMENT, THE CHINESE APPEAR TO
HAVE ONLY MINIMAL INTEREST IN GLOBAL POLLUTION PROBLEMS.
ON THE OTHER HAND, THE PRC HAS MADE A CONSIDERABLE EFFORT
AROUND THE WORLD IN THE HEALTH FIELD, THROUGH BILATERAL
ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS. A CENTRAL FEATURE OF ITS AID PROGRAMS IN AFRICA, FOR EXAMPLE, IS ITS MEDICAL ASSISTANCE
PROJECTS--ALL OF WHICH HAVE BEEN WELL-RECEIVED. STILL,
PEKING HAS NOT BEEN AS HELPFUL AS IT MIGHT BE IN PROVIDING USEFUL STATISTIPS AND INFORMATION TO INTERNATIONAL
GROUPS, SUCH AS THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION (IN WHICH
IT IS MARGINALLY ACTIVE).

38. LAW OF THE SEA: IN GENERAL, THE CHINESE SUPPORT THE
DESIRE OF MOST LDCS TO INHIBIT UNREGULATED EXPLOITATION OF
THE SEAS BY THE DEVELOPED COUNTRIES. HOWEVER, THEY HAVE
SHOWN NO INTEREST IN ANY INTERNATIONAL OCEANS AGREEMENTS,
FROM WHICH THEY FEEL THEY HAVE LITTLE TO GAIN. ON THE
QUESTION OF OCEAN POLLUTION, PEKING HAS ADOPTED A
LAISSEZ FAIRE STAND, PROBABLY BECAUSE IT DOES NOT WANT TO
SADDLE ITS RAPIDLY EXPANDING MERCHANT FLEET WITH ADDITIONAL
EXPENSES AND REGULATIONS. CHRISTOPHER

CAN BE EXPECTED TO ASSUME A LOW PROFILE AT THE UN CONFER-

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
ENCE ON SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY FOR DEVELOPMENT, TO BE HELD
IN VIENNA IN AUGUST-SEPTEMBER 1979, AND IN THE PREPARATORY
MEETINGS PRECEDING THE CONFERENCE. COMMITTED TO ITS OWN
POLICY OF RAPID INDUSTRIALIZATION AND MODERNIZATION,
CHINA WILL, IN GENERAL, SUPPORT THIRD WORLD DEMANDS FOR
IMPROVED ACCESS TO WESTERN TECHNOLOGY. IN ALL LIKELIHOOD,
HOWEVER, ITS ACTION AT THE CONFERENCE WILL BE LIMITED TO
MORAL AND BALLOT SUPPORT.
2. DESPITE ITS CONSIDERABLE POTENTIAL FOR INFLUENCE AND
LEADERSHIP AMONG THE LDCS, CHINA DOES NOT WISH TO BE SEEN
AS BEING MOTIVATED BY A DESIRE TO IMPOSE ITS WILL ON OTHER
COUNTRIES. IT ALSO WISHES TO AVOID INVOLVEMENT IN THIRD
WORLD CONTROVERSIES AS WELL AS COMMITMENTS THAT RESTRICT
ITS ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL FREEDOM OF ACTION. IT CAN BE
EXPECTED, HOWEVER, TO ENGAGE IN SHARP AND ACRIMONIOUS
CLASHES WITH THE SOVIET UNION DURING THE UNCSTD.
END SUMMARY.
3. FOREIGN POLICY
4. THE CORNERSTONE OF CHINA'S FOREIGN POLICY IS CONTAINCONFIDENTIAL
PAGE 03

STATE 238846

MENT OF SOVIET INFLUENCE THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. TO THIS
END, PEKING ADVOCATES A &quot;UNITED FRONT&quot; OF ALL THIRD WORLD
COUNTRIES.
5. THE SINO-SOVIET DISPUTE--WHICH OSTENSIBLY BEGAN OVER
IDEOLOGICAL DIFFERENCES IN 1960--HAS EVOLVED INTO SEEMINGLY IMPLACABLE HOSTILITY. PEKING VIEWS THE SOVIET
UNION AS THE WORLD'S MOST AMBITIOUS PRACTITIONER OF
COLONIALISM AND THE SOURCE OF AN &quot;INEVITABLE&quot; THIRD WORLD
WAR. AS SUCH, THE USSR IS SEEN AS POSING A DIRECT AND
LONG-TERM THREAT TO CHINA'S SECURITY.
6. THE PERCEIVED SOVIET THREAT HAS LED CHINA TO SEEK
CLOSER RELATIOSWITH THE WEST, PRESSING FOR STRONGER
MEASURES TO RESIST SOVIET EXPANSIONISM. IN THIS CONTEXT,
CHINA CONTINUES TO URGE, FOR EXAMPLE, THAT NATO BE EXPANDED
AND STRENGTHENED. PEKING EVEN GOES SO FAR AS TO APPLAUD
WESTERN INVOLVEMENT IN FORMER COLONIAL AREAS WHENEVER IT
CONSIDERS THAT SUCH INVOLVEMENT WOULD INHIBIT THE GROWTH
OF SOVIET INFLUENCE.
7. THE PRC'S RAPIDLY DEVELOPING ECONOMIC RELATIONS WITH
THE INDUSTRIALIZED WEST HAVE BEEN ONE OF THE MAJOR ELEMENTS
OF CHINA'S ECONOMIC AND FOREIGN POLICIES SINCE THE DEATH
OF MAO TSE-TUNG AND THE PURGE OF HIS LEFTIST FOLLOWERS
IN 1976. CHINA IS COUNTING ON IMPROVED RELATIONS WITH THE
INDUSTRIALIZED WEST TO FACILITATE A LARGE-SCALE TRANSFER

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
OF ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY WHICH IT HOPES WILL STIMULATE AND
AUGMENT INDIGENOUS EFFORTS TO DEVELOP A FULLY MODERNIZED
ECONOMY BY THE END OF THE CENTURY. IN PURSUIT OF DEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVES, CHINA SIGNED TRADE, AND SCIENTIFIC AND
TECHNICAL AGREEMENTS WITH JAPAN (WORTH MORE THAN DOLS 10
BILLION) AND WEST EUROPEAN COUNTRIES DURING THE FIRST HALF
OF 1978.
8. SINCE THE LATE 1960S, PEKING HAS SOUGHT TO EXPAND ITS
CONFIDENTIAL
PAGE 04

STATE 238846

OPTIONS IN VARIOUS FOREIGN POLICY AREAS AND ISSUES BY
CAUTIOUSLY RELAXING SOME OF CHINA'S IDEOLOGICAL STRICTURES
AS WELL AS ITS HISTORIC SELF-CENTEREDNESS. THE PRC,
HOWEVER, REMAINS FIERCELY COMMITTED TO ITS LONGSTANDING
PRINCIPLES OF POLITICAL SELF-DETERMINATION AND ECONOMIC
SELF-RELIANCE. PEKING CONSISTENTLY AVOIDS STEPS THAT
WOULD SUBSTANTIALLY INCREASE CHINA'S POLITICAL OR ECONOMIC DEPENDENCE ON OTHER COUNTRIES.
9. CHINA IN THE INTERNATIONAL ARENA
10. SINCE ITS ADMISSION TO THE UNITED NATIONS IN 1971,
CHINA HAS PROCLAIMED ITSELF A SPOKESMAN FOR THE DEVELOPING
COUNTRIES AND HAS BEEN A CRITIC OF THE TWO SUPERPOWERS-ESPECIALLY THE SOVIET UNION. HOPING THAT CONFLICT BETWEEN
THE SUPERPOWERS AND THE THIRD WORLD MIGHT CREATE OPENINGS
THAT WOULD ENHANCE CHINA'S OWN INFLUENCE AND PRESTIGE,
PEKING USES EVERY OPPORTUNITY TO SUPPORT THE THIRD WORLD
LINE AND BLAME THE SOVIET UNION AND THE UNITED STATES FOR
ALL GLOBAL INEQUITIES. RHETORIC DIRECTED AGAINST THE
SOVIET UNION CAN BE PARTICULARLY VIRULENT AND DISRUPTIVE.
11. THE PRC BACKS ITS MORAL SUPPORT FOR THE DEVELOPING
COUNTRIES BY VOTING A STRAIGHT THIRD WORLD TICKET WHEN BLOC
VOTING TAKES PLACE. THE ONLY EXCEPTIONS OCCUR WHEN CHINESE
NATIONAL INTERESTS MIGHT BE COMPROMISED DIRECTLY. AT THESE
TIMES, THE PRC GENERALLY DECLINES TO VOTE ON THE GROUNDS OF
&quot;IDEOLOGICAL OR POLITICAL PRINCIPLE.&quot;
12. IN CONTRAST WITH ITS UNFAILING ATTENDANCE AT FULLDRESS UN CONFERENCES AND SPECIAL SESSIONS, PEKING HAS
ADOPTED A LOW-PROFILE, HIGHLY SELECTIVE APPROACH TO PARTICIPATION IN THE UN'S COMMITTEES AND SPECIALIZED ORGANIZATIONS. POLITICAL AND IDEOLOGICAL CRITERIA, SELF-INTEREST,

PAGE 05

STATE 238846

AND LIMITATIONS ON THE NUMBER OF TRAINED PERSONNEL AVAILABLE FOR ASSIGNMENT ABROAD ALL INFLUENCE THESE DECISIONS.
13. CHINA USES ITS PRINCIPLE OF NON-INTERFERENCE IN THE

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
INTERNAL AFFAIRS OF OTHERS, FOR EXAMPLE, TO EXPLAIN ITS
REFUSAL TO JOIN OR PROVIDE FINANCIAL SUPPORT FOR ANY OF THE
UN ORGANS INVOLVED IN PEACEKEEPING ACTIVITIES. DECISIONS
TO JOIN THE UN ECONOMIC, SCIENTIFIC AND CULTURAL ORGANIZATION (UNESCO) AND THE FOOD AND AGRICULTURE ORGANIZATION
(FAO), ON THE OTHER HAND, PROBABLY WERE BASED ON THE DESIRE
FOR EASIER ACCESS TO WESTERN SCIENTIFIC INFORMATION. THE
NEED FOR IMPORTED TECHNOLOGY CAN BE OVERRIDDEN, HOWEVER,
WHEN PEKING FEELS THAT THE PRICE IS TOO HIGH--AS IN ITS
DECISION NOT TO SURRENDER ITS &quot;SOVEREIGNTY&quot; IN THE
DEVELOPMENT OF NUCLEAR RESOURCES BY JOINING THE INTERNATIONAL ATOMIC ENERGY AGENCY (IAEA).
14. THERE IS A STRIKING CONTRAST BETWEEN CHINA'S PURPOSEFULLY LOUD AND ABRASIVE RHETORIC DURING GENERAL DEBATE AND
ITS LOW-KEY APPROACH TO WORKING-LEVEL DELIBERATIONS AND
BEHIND-THE-SCENES LOBBYING. EXCEPT IN THE CASE OF THE
UN SECURITY COUNCIL, IN WHICH MEMBERS ARE OBLIGED TO
ASSUME THE PRESIDENCY ON A ROTATING BASIS, CHINESE
REPRESENTATIVES HAVE NEITHER SOUGHT THE CHAIRMANSHIP OF
ANY COMMITTEES OR SUBSIDIARY BODIES OF THE UN NOR SERVED
WHEN ASKED. AS COMMITTEE MEMBERS, THE CHINESE ARE
GENERALLY UP-TO-DATE ON THE TOPICS AT HAND AND DESIROUS OF
ADVANCING THEIR OWN KNOWLEDGE. UNLESS THEY HAVE CRITICAL
NATIONAL INTERESTS TO PURSUE, HOWEVER, THE CHINESE SELDOM
PROVIDE RELEVANT INFORMATION OR OFFER CONSTRUCTIVE IDEAS
TO THE GROUP.
15. ONLY WHEN PURSUING SPECIFIC NATIONAL INTERESTS OR,
MORE FREQUENTLY, WHEN THERE IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO CONFRONT
THE SOVIETS, DOES PEKING ASSUME AN AGGRESSIVE STANCE IN
UN COMMITTEES AND AFFILIATED ORGANIZATIONS. AGAIN, ATTACKS

ON THE SOVIETS ARE OFTEN INTENSE ENOUGH TO CONFOUND
SEVERELY COMMITTEE PROCEEDINGS.
16. CHINESE UNWILLINGNESS TO PARTICIPATE IN SUBSTANTIVE
PROCEEDINGS AT BOTH FORMAL AND INFORMAL LEVELS EVEN
EXTENDS TO AVOIDANCE OF DEVELOPING-COUNTRY ACTIVITIES.
PEKING HAS,FOR EXAMPLE, DECLINED PRC MEMBERSHIP IN THE .
GROUP OF 77 AND HAS REFUSED ANY ROLE IN THE GROUP'S EFFORTS
TO CREATE A NEW INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC ORDER (NIEO).
CHINA'S MEMBERSHIP IN THE ASIAN GROUP--ONE OF THE UN'S
FIVE OFFICIALLY RECOGNIZED CAUCUSING GROUPS--IS ONLY
NOMINAL. FURTHERMORE, CHINA IS NOT A MEMBER OF THE
NON-ALIGNED MOVEMENT AND HAS REFUSED AN INVITATION TO
JOIN THE COALITION OF COASTAL STATES AT THE LAW OF THE
SEA FORUMS.
17. PEKING'S DISINCLINATION TO TAKE AN ACTIVE ROLE IN
THIRD WORLD ORGANIZATIONS IS PROBABLY DUE LARGELY TO THE

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
IMAGE CHINA WISHES TO MAINTAIN OF NOT ACTING AS A SUPERPOWER BY IMPOSING ITS WILL ON OTHERS. ITS RELUCTANCE TO
BECOME EMBROILED IN THE INTRA-BLOC CONTROVERSIES OF THE
DEVELOPING COUNTRIES AS WELL AS ITS DESIRE TO AVOID
FINANCIALLY EXPENSIVE AND POLITICALLY RESTRICTIVE COMMITMENTS ALSO ACT AS DISINCENTIVES TO MEMBERSHIP IN
SPECIALIZED GROUPS.
18. THE POST-MAO LEADERSHIP'S MORE OPEN AND PRAGMATIC
APPROACH TO FOREIGN POLICY IS NOW ALLOWING SLIGHTLY MORE
ACTIVE PARTICIPATION IN UN-SPONSORED PROJECTS. THIS YEAR,
FOR THE FIRST TIME, STUDY GROUPS FROM THE FOOD AND
AGRICULTURE ORGANIZATION AND THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION
WERE ABLE TO VISIT THE PRC. STILL, SUCH CHANGES HAVE

PAGE 07

BEEN LARGELY SYMBOLIC. THERE HAS BEEN LITTLE INDICATION
THAT PEKING INTENDS TO ASSUME A MORE CONCRETE ROLE IN
SUPPORT OF THIRD WORLD INTERESTS.
19. ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT
20. CHINESE ECONOMIC GROWTH WAS SERIOUSLY DISRUPTED BY THE
TRAUMAS OF 1976, AMONG THEM: POLITICAL UPHEAVAL (CAUSED BY
THE DEATHS OF CHINA'S TOP LEADERS AND A MAJOR SUCCESSION
STRUGGLE) THAT CONTRIBUTED TO WIDESPREAD LABOR UNREST, AND
A SHATTERING EARTHQUAKE THAT LEFT THREE-QUARTERS OF A
MILLION DEAD AND DEVASTATED ONE OF CHINA'S MOST IMPORTANT
INDUSTRIAL AREAS. CHINA'S GROSS NATIONAL PRODUCT (GNP)
HAS BEEN ESTIMATED AT ABOUT DOLS 323 BILLION (1976 US DOLS)

HOWEVER, ECONOMIC GROWTH RESUMED AS CHINA BEGAN TO RECOVER

28. FOREIGN DEBT: CHINA'S INSISTENCE ON SELF-RELIANCE
HAS RESULTED IN A DEEPLY INGRAINED
ELUCTANCE TO GO INTO
DEBT. AS A RESULT, PEKING HAS CONSISTENTLY REFUSED TO
.
ACCEPT DIRECT GOVERNMENT OR GOVERNMENT-GUARANTEED CREDITS
FROM FOREIGN COUNTRIES. IT HAS, HOWEVER, ACCEPTED VARIOUS
FORMS OF SUPPLIER CREDITS TIED TO SPECIFIC PURCHASES, AND
DEPOSITS (ONLY SHORT-TERM UNTIL RECENTLY) OF FOREIGN
CURRENCIES WITH BRANCHES OF THE BANK OF CHINA.
29. THROUGH THESE KINDS OF CREDITS, CHINA'S DEBT HAS GROWN

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
CONSIDERABLY DURING THE 1970S. PRIMARILY BECAUSE OF THE
USE OF CREDIT FOR COMPLETE PLANT AND AGRICULTURAL PURCHASES
IN 1973 AND 1974, THE PRC'S DEBT SERVICE RATIO ROSE FROM
4 PERCENT IN 1973 TO A HIGH OF 23 PERCENT IN 1976. BY THE
END OF 1976, OUTSTANDING EXTERNAL LIABILITIES TOTALED
ABOUT DOLS 2 BILLION. (TOTAL GOLD AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE
RESERVES HAVE BEEN ESTIMATED AT DOLS 3-4 BILLION.)

TO ACCEPT--A GREATER VARIETY OF CREDITS THAN IT HAD IN THE
PAST IN ORDER TO FACILITATE IMPORTS OF NEEDED TECHNOLOGY,
WHOLE PLANTS, AND EQUIPMENT. YET, EVEN THOUGH THE DEBT
SERVICE RATIO CAN BE EXPECTED TO RISE IN THE COMING YEARS,
IT IS CLEAR THAT THE CHINESE INTEND TO CONTINUE RESTRAINT
IN BORROWING. IT IS UNLIKELY THAT THE PRC WILL ALLOW ITS
DEBT SERVICE RATIO TO GO MUCH HIGHER THAN ITS 1976 LEVEL.
31. OUTLOOK: WHETHER CHINA CAN EVENTUALLY SUCCEED IN
BUILDING A POWERFUL, MODERN STATE WILL DEPEND IN LARGE
MEASURE ON THE ABILITY OF THE PRESENT, MODERATE REGIME
TO CREATE A STABLE POLITICAL CLIMATE AND MOBILIZE CHINA'S
AMPLE HUMAN AND NATURAL RESOURCES. SUBSTANTIAL SHORTFALLS
IN MEETING THE AMBITIOUS GOALS THAT PEKING HAS SET FOR THE
NEXT EIGHT YEARS WOULD MEAN A SERIOUS SETBACK FOR PEKING'S
LONG-TERM PLANS, AND COULD THREATEN THE POLITICAL LONGEVITY
OF THOSE IN THE CURRENT REGIME WHO HAVE BEEN WILLING TO
SACRIFICE MAOIST ORTHODOXY IN THE NAME OF RAPID DEVELOPMENT.
32. LIKELY CHINESE ATTITUDES AT THE UNCSTD
33. WHILE THERE MAY BE SOME INTENSE VERBAL DUELING BETWEEN
THE CHINESE AND THE SOVIETS, PEKING WILL PROBABLY ADOPT A
PASSIVE APPROACH TO THE SUBSTANTIVE PROCEEDINGS AT THE
UNCSTD. MORAL AND BALLOT SUPPORT FOR THE THIRD WORLD LINE
IN GENERAL WILL BE OFFERED. WHEN THE PRC POSITION DOES NOT
COINCIDE WITH THAT LINE, THE CHINESE WILL PROBABLY REFRAIN
FROM VOTING.
34. FOOD AND AGRICULTURE: ACCORDING TO THE CHINESE,
GLOBAL FOOD SUP LY PROBLEMS ARE THE RESULT OF SUPERPOWER .
&quot;EXPLOITATION&quot; OF THE DEVELOPING COUNTRIES. NATIONAL
&quot;SELF-RELIANCE,&quot; IN THEIR VIEW, IS THE ONLY REAL SOLUTION.
DESPITE ITS FREQUENT LARGESCALE PURCHASES OF GRAIN, PEKING

35. NATURAL RESOURCES: CHINA STRONGLY SUPPORTS THE RIGHT
OF EVERY STATE TO EXERCISE SOVEREIGNTY OVER ITS NATURAL
RESOURCES. CONSEQUENTLY, IT HAS RESISTED DIRECT FOREIGN
INVESTMENT IN THE PRC AND HAS DECLINED MEMBERSHIP IN INTERNATIONAL REGULATORY AGENCIES, SUCH AS THE INTERNATIONAL
ATOMIC ENERGY AGENCY. ENERGY RESOURCES HAVE BEEN OF
PARTICULAR CONCERN TO THE CHINESE; PEKING SUPPORTS OPEC AND
OTHER DEVELOPING-COUNTRY PRODUCER GROUPINGS, BUT IT HAS
MADE NO EFFORTS TO JOIN THEM.
36. TRANSFER OF TECHNOLOGY: WITH ITS CURRENT EMPHASIS ON
A MAJOR ROLE FOR IMPORTED PLANT AND TECHNOLOGY IN CHINA'S
DEVELOPMENT, PEKING VIEWS SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY AS THE
&quot;COMMON WEALTH OF MANKIND.&quot; ACCORDINGLY, THE PRC IS A
STRONG SUPPORTER OF TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER BY THE DEVELOPED
COUNTRIES TO THE LDCS.
37. HEALTH AND QUALITY OF LIFE: WHILE TAKING PRECAUTIONS
TO PROTECT THEIR OWN ENVIRONMENT, THE CHINESE APPEAR TO
HAVE ONLY MINIMAL INTEREST IN GLOBAL POLLUTION PROBLEMS.
ON THE OTHER HAND, THE PRC HAS MADE A CONSIDERABLE EFFORT
AROUND THE WORLD IN THE HEALTH FIELD, THROUGH BILATERAL
ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS. A CENTRAL FEATURE OF ITS AID PROGRAMS IN AFRICA, FOR EXAMPLE, IS ITS MEDICAL ASSISTANCE
PROJECTS--ALL OF WHICH HAVE BEEN WELL-RECEIVED. STILL,
PEKING HAS NOT BEEN AS HELPFUL AS IT MIGHT BE IN PROVIDING USEFUL STATISTIPS AND INFORMATION TO INTERNATIONAL
GROUPS, SUCH AS THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION (IN WHICH
IT IS MARGINALLY ACTIVE).

38. LAW OF THE SEA: IN GENERAL, THE CHINESE SUPPORT THE
DESIRE OF MOST LDCS TO INHIBIT UNREGULATED EXPLOITATION OF
THE SEAS BY THE DEVELOPED COUNTRIES. HOWEVER, THEY HAVE
SHOWN NO INTEREST IN ANY INTERNATIONAL OCEANS AGREEMENTS,
FROM WHICH THEY FEEL THEY HAVE LITTLE TO GAIN. ON THE
QUESTION OF OCEAN POLLUTION, PEKING HAS ADOPTED A
LAISSEZ FAIRE STAND, PROBABLY BECAUSE IT DOES NOT WANT TO
SADDLE ITS RAPIDLY EXPANDING MERCHANT FLEET WITH ADDITIONAL
EXPENSES AND REGULATIONS. CHRISTOPHER
