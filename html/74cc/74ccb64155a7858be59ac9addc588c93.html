		<h3>Tor</h3>
		<p><a href="https://www.torproject.org">Tor</a> is an encrypted anonymising network that makes it harder to intercept internet communications, or see where communications are coming from or going to.</p>
		<p>In order to use the WikiLeaks public submission system as detailed above you can download the Tor Browser Bundle, which is a Firefox-like browser available for Windows, Mac OS X and GNU/Linux and pre-configured to connect using the anonymising system Tor.</p>
		<h4>Tails</h4>
		<p>If you are at high risk and you have the capacity to do so, you can also access the submission system through a secure operating system called <a href="https://tails.boum.org">Tails</a>. Tails is an operating system launched from a USB stick or a DVD that aim to leaves no traces when the computer is shut down after use and automatically routes your internet traffic through Tor. Tails will require you to have either a USB stick or a DVD at least 4GB big and a laptop or desktop computer.</p>

		<h3>Tips</h3>
		<p>Our submission system works hard to preserve your anonymity, but we recommend you also take some of your own precautions. Please review these basic guidelines. </p>
		<div>
			<h4>1. Contact us if you have specific problems</h4>
			<p>If you have a very large submission, or a submission with a complex format, or are a high-risk source, please <a href="#submit_help_contact">contact us</a>. In our experience it is always possible to find a custom solution for even the most seemingly difficult situations.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h4>2. What computer to use</h4>
			<p>If the computer you are uploading from could subsequently be audited in an investigation, consider using a computer that is not easily tied to you. Technical users can also use <a href="https://tails.boum.org">Tails</a> to help ensure you do not leave any records of your submission on the computer.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h4>3. Do not talk about your submission to others</h4>
			<p>If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in source protection – it is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This includes other media organisations.</p>
		</div>

	</div>

		<h3>After</h3>

		<div>
			<h4>1. Do not talk about your submission to others</h4>
			<p>If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in source protection – it is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This includes other media organisations.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h4>2. Act normal</h4>
			<p>If you are a high-risk source, avoid saying anything or doing anything after submitting which might promote suspicion. In particular, you should try to stick to your normal routine and behaviour.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h4>3. Remove traces of your submission</h4>
			<p>If you are a high-risk source and the computer you prepared your submission on, or uploaded it from, could subsequently be audited in an investigation, we recommend that you format and dispose of the computer hard drive and any other storage media you used.</p>
			<p>In particular, hard drives retain data after formatting which may be visible to a digital forensics team and flash media (USB sticks, memory cards and SSD drives) retain data even after a secure erasure. If you used flash media to store sensitive data, it is important to destroy the media.</p>
			<p>If you do this and are a high-risk source you should make sure there are no traces of the clean-up, since such traces themselves may draw suspicion.</p>
			<div>
				<h4>4. If you face legal action</h4>
				<p>If a legal action is brought against you as a result of your submission, there are organisations that may help you. The Courage Foundation is an international organisation dedicated to the protection of journalistic sources. You can find more details at <a href="https://www.couragefound.org">https://www.couragefound.org</a>.</p>

		<p>WikiLeaks publishes documents of political or historical importance that are censored or otherwise suppressed. We specialise in strategic global publishing and large archives.</p>
		<p>The following is the address of our secure site where you can anonymously upload your documents to WikiLeaks editors. You can only access this submissions system through Tor. (See our <a href="#submit_help_tor">Tor tab</a> for more information.) We also advise you to read our <a href="#submit_help_tips">tips for sources</a> before submitting.</p>

			<!--<div>
				Copy this address into your Tor browser. Advanced users, if they wish, can also add a further layer of encryption to their submission using <a href="#submit_wlkey">our public PGP key</a>.
			</div>-->
		</div>

		<p>If you cannot use Tor, or your submission is very large, or you have specific requirements, WikiLeaks provides several alternative methods. <a href="#submit_help_contact">Contact us</a> to discuss how to proceed.</p>

MME WANG: YOU HAVE TRAVELED IN SINKIANG AND KWANGTUNG
AND I HOPE THAT MADAME KANG DIDN'T MAKE YOU TOO TIRED.
YOU ARE OUR GUEST AND YOU HAVE TRAVELED A LONG WAY TO
VISIT US. AFTER TWO YEARS YOU HAVE RETURNED TO VISIT
SINKIANG AND KWANGTUNG. WHAT IS YOUR IMPRESSION OF
THESE PLACES.

SEN. MANSFIELD: I WAS VERY IMPRESSED. THIS WAS MY
FIRST VISIT TO SINKIANG. I FOUND CALM, COMPETENT PEOPLE
IN SINKIANG, INCLUDING THE MINORITY NATIONALITIES.
SINKIANG REMINDS MR. DIKEOS AND MYSELF OF OUR OWN STATE
OF MONTANA. THE TOPOGRAPHY AND PEOPLE AND PRODUCE ARE
COMPARABLE EXCEPT FOR SINKIANG'S PEANUT CROP. I WAS
ASTOUNDED WITH THE PROGRESS IN KWANGTUNG. I NOTICED
THE VAST INCREASE IN TRAFFIC IN PEKING AND THE WELL-
BEING OF THE PEOPLE. THERE HAS BEEN A LOT OF PROGRESS.
YOU HAVE COME A LONG WAY IN ACHIEVING STABILITY AND
ECONOMIC PROGRESS. THERE IS A LONG WAY STILL TO GO. WE
HAVE HAD A VERY HEARTENING EXPERIENCE. WE WERE WELL
RECEIVED EVERYWHERE. WE LEARNED A LOT MORE THAN WE KNEW.

MME WANG: ALL THIS PROGRESS HAS BEEN SCORED UNDER
THE CORRECT LEADERSHIP OF CHAIRMAN MAO, BY IMPLEMENTING
THE CORRECT LINES OF CHAIRMAN MAO AND BY THE GUIDANCE AND
BRILLIANCE OF CHAIRMAN MAO'S THOUGHT. OF COURSE
WHAT WE HAVE ACHIEVED IS NOT ENOUGH. IN THE DAYS AHEAD,
INHERITING THE BEQUEST OF CHAIRMAN MAO, WE WILL CONTINUE
THE REVOLUTIONARY CAUSE AND MARCH ALONG THE GREAT
REVOLUTIONARY COURSE CHARTED BY VMAIRMAN MAO,TO WIN AND
TO STRIVE FOR GREATER PROGRESS AND ACHIEVEMENTS. THE WHOLE
PARTY, ARMY AND PEOPLE IN OUR COUNTRY ARE DEEPLY GRIEVED
AT THE DEATH OF CHAIRMAN MAO. WE ARE DETERMINED TO
TURN GRIEF INTO STRENGTH AND TO RESPOND TO THE CALL OF
THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE, TO RALLY MORE CLOSELY AROUND THE
CENTRAL COMMITTEE. THE BRILLIANT THOUGHT OF MAO TSE-TUNG
WILL ALWAYS CONTINUE TO GUIDE US. WE WILL CONTINUE TO
MARCH ALONG THE COURSE CHARTED BY HIM AND WILL ALWAYS
REMEMBER OUR GREAT LEADER.

C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 2 OF 4 PEKING 2047

EXDIS

WHEN EVERY ONE OF US RECOLLECTS HOW WE GREW UP AND
THE EARTHSHAKING CHANGES IN OUR MOTHERLAND AND THE
THRIVING SCENE OF OUR MOTHERLAND WE CAN NOT FORGET OUR
GREAT LEADER. THERE WOULD BE NO CHINA OF TODAY IF THERE
HAD BEEN NO CHAIRMAN MAO.

WHEN WE RECALL THE OPENING OF RELATIONS BETWEEN CHINA
AND THE UNITED STATES IT WAS ALSO CHAIRMAN MAO WHO
MADE THIS GREAT DECISION WHICH LED TO THE OPENING OF
RELATIONS WITH THE UNITED STATES. (AT THIS POINT MME
WANG WAS WEEPING AS WAS TANG, WEN-SHENG.)

SEN. MANSFIELD: WE ARE WELL AWARE OF THAT FACT.
WE HAVE SEEN THE GRIEF OF YOUR PEOPLE IN THIS YEAR OF
TRAGEDY BECAUSE OF THE DEATH OF CHOU EN-LAI, OF CHU TE
AND OTHER SMALLER EARTHQUAKES, BUT LIKE THE PHOENIX CHINA
WILL RISE OUT OF THIS TRAGEDY AND WILL TURN GRIEF INTO
STRENGTH AND PRODUCE MORE FOR ITS PEOPLE.

WHEN MRS. MANSFIELD AND I SAW CHOU EN-LAI A YEAR AGO,
HE TOLD US THE PERSON RESPONSIBLE FOR INITIATING
RELATIONS BETWEEN CHINA AND THE UNITED STATES WAS
CHAIRMAN MAO, WHO HAD READ AN ARTICLE IN THE &quot;FOREIGN
CONFIDENTIAL

CONFIDENTIAL

PAGE 02        PEKING 02047  02 OF 04  091011Z

AFFAIRS QUARTERLY&quot; WRITTEN BY NIXON BEFORE NIXON BECAME
PRESIDENT AND ON THE BASIS OF THAT ARTICLE THIS
RELATIONSHIP HAD BEEN BROUGHT ABOUT. THIS IS EVIDENCE
OF THE FORESIGHT OF CHAIRMAN MAO IN SEEKING NORMALIZATION
BETWEEN OUR TWO NATIONS. (AT THIS POINT THE INTERPRETER
WAS WEEPING AND WAS NOT TRANSLATING SENATOR MANSFIELD'S
WORDS EXACTLY.)

MME WANG: THAT IS TRUE.

SEN. MANSFIELD: MADAME VICE MINISTER, HOW DO YOU
THINK RELATIONS BETWEEN OUR TWO COUNTRIES SHAPE UP
AT THIS TIME?

MME WANG: MAY I KNOW YOUR OBSERVATIONS AND VIEWS ON
RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN OUR TWO COUNTRIES?

SEN. MANSFIELD; I BELIEVE THEY ARE PROGRESSING,
PERHAPS NOT AS FAST AS THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA OR
WE WOULD DESIRE. THE SHANGHAI COMMUNIQUE STATES UNEQUIVOCALLY
THAT THERE ARE NOT TWO CHINAS BUT ONE CHINA. THE
IMPLEMENTATION OF THE SHANGHAI COMMUNIQUE IS NOT AS FAST
AS SOME OF US WOULD LIKE BUT PROGRESS HAS BEEN MADE AND
WILL BE MADE. AFTER THE ELECTION PRESIDENT FORD OR MR.
CARTER WILL BE ABLE, ON THE BASIS OF A NEW FOUR-YEAR TERM,
TO GIVE THE KIND OF ATTENTION AND CONSIDERATION TO CHINA-U.S.
RELATIONS WHICH HAS NOT BEEN POSSIBLE LATELY BECAUSE OF
FACTORS YOU UNDERSTAND, INCLUDING THE SHORTNESS
OF PRESIDENT FORD'S TERM AFTER NIXON'S RESIGNATION, THE
PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN WHICH BEGAN ONE YEAR AGO AND THE
ELECTION WHICH ON NOVEMBER 2ND WILL DECIDE WHO WILL BE
PRESIDENT ON JANUARY 20, 1976.

MME WANG: ON THE QUESTION OF NORMALIZATION I WOULD
LIKE TO EXPRESS MY VIEWS ALEO. IN HIS REPORT TO THE
GOVERNMENT AT THE FOURTH NATIONAL PEOPLE'S CONGRESS
CHOU EN-LAI POINTED OUT THAT PROVIDED BOTH PARTIES
ABIDE BY THE PRINCIPLES OF THE SHANGHAI COMMUNIQUE,
SINO-AMERICAN RELATIONS CAN BE IMPROVED AND THIS POINT
WAS ALSO MENTIONED BY SENATOR MANSFIELD A FEW MINUTES AGO.
ON THE QUESTION OF NORMALIZATION I AM SURE THAT
CONFIDENTIAL

SENATOR MANSFIELD AND OTHER FRIENDS SITTING HERE ARE
VERY CLEAR ON WHAT OUR STAND IS. THAT IS THE JAPANESE
FORMULA AND ALSO THE THREE PRINCIPLES; NAMELY
1) ABROGATION OF THE TREATY; 2) WITHDRAWAL OF THE
AMERICAN TROOPS AND 3) SEVERANCE OF DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS.
FURTHERMORE, IT WILL NOT DO IF ANY ONE OF THESE
THREE PRINCIPLES IS MISSING AND IT ALSO WILL NOT DO
IF YOU UNDERTAKE ANY DISGUISED FORM. THERE IS NO
OTHER ALTERNATIVE. WE DO NOT BELIEVE IN SO-CALLED
PEACEFUL TRANSITION. AS CHAIRMAN MAO TEACHES US, IF YOU
DON'T USE A BROOM TO SWEEP DUST THE DUST WILL NOT RUN
AWAY ITSELF.
THE GROUP OF REACTIONARIES IN TAIWAN WILL NOT LAY DOWN
THEIR BUTCHERS' NIVES OF THEIR OWN ACCORD. THEREFORE,
WE DON'T BELIEVE IN PEACEFUL TJANSITION AND WE BASE
OKRSELVES ON A FOOTING TO FIGHT.

OF COURSE, WHEN WE SHALL LIBERATE TAIWAN IS OUR OWN
INTERNAL AFFAIR AND NO OTHER COUNTRY HAS THE RIGHT TO
INTERFERE. THIS STAND OF OURS HAS BEEN MADE CLEAR TO
MANY OF OUR AMERICAN FRIENDS.

SEN. MANSFIELD: WELL, I WOULDN'T DISAGREE ABOUT WHAT HAS BEEN
SAID ABOUT WHAT THE CHINESE POSITION IS. IT HAS BEEN REITERATED
MANY TIMES. IT WAS UNDERSTOOD WHEN CHOU EN-LAI AND NIXON SIGNED
THE SHANGHAI COMMUNIQUE AND IT WAS ANTICIPATED THEN, AND STILL IS,
THAT WHEN THE JOINING OF TAIWAN AND THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA
TAKES PLACE THAT WILL BE BY PEACEFUL MEANS.

AS WE ALL KNOW, THERE HAVE BEEN UPS AND DOWNS ON THE TAIWAN
QUESTION. AS FAR AS TROOP WITHDRAWALS ARE CONCERNED, THERE HAS
BEEN A
REDUCTION FROM OVER 10,000 TO LESS THAN 2,000. AS FAR AS
THE JAPANESE FORMULA IS CONCERNED, THAT WAS STATED IN THE LAST
VISIT IN  1974. I'M SURE, VICE MINISTER WANG, YOU RECOGNIZE THAT
ON OUR PART THERE ARE A LOT OF KNOTS TO BE UNTIED. THAT WILL TAKE
A LITTLE TIME. IN THEIR HISTORY, THE CHINESE HAVE BEEN NOTED FOR
THEIR PATIENCE AND FOR THEIR UNDERSTANDING OF PRACTICAL SITUATIONS,
AND I AM SURE YOU ARE AWARE THAT IT WILL TAKE MORE TIME TO UNTANGLE
THESE KNOTS BEFORE WE CAN ACHIEVE OUR GOAL OF NORMALIZATION.
FURTHERMORE, UNDER OUR CONSTITUTION THE PRESIDENT RATHER THAN THE
CONFIDENTIAL

PAGE 04        PEKING 02047  02 OF 04  091011Z

CONGRESS MUST DO THIS. PRESIDENT FORD IN HONOLULU LAST YEAR STATED
THAT THE US GOAL WAS &quot;FULL NORMALIZATION OF RELATIONS WITH THE
PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA.&quot;

MME WANG: IF THIS QUESTION IS NOT SOLVED AND IF IT IS PROLONGED
THEN THE RESPONSIBILITY IS NOT ON THE SIDE OF CHINA, BUT ON THE
SIDE OF THE UNITED STATES.

SEN. MANSFIELD: I'VE INDICATED THAT THERE ARE MANY KNOTS TO UNTIE
AND THAT IT WILL TAKE TIME.

MME WANG: I THINK WE HAVE BEEN PATIENT ENOUGH. WE HAVE WAITED FOR
MORE THAN 27 YEARS NOW.

SEN. MANSFIELD: THAT IS A LONG TIME, BUT PRESIDENT NIXON VISITED
CHINA LESS THAN FIVE YEARS AGO AND THAT SHOULD BE TAKEN INTO CON-
SIDERATION AS WELL AS THE OVER 20-YEAR SPAN.

MME WANG: ON THIS ISSUE WE FEEL THAT IT IS THE UNITED STATES THAT
OWES US A DEBT AND IT IS NOT US WHO OWES THE US A DEBT.

SEN. MANSFIELD: WELL, I THINK IT'S UP TO THE UNITED STATES TO
FULFILL ITS PART OF THE SHANGHAI COMMUNIQUE.

MME WANG: WELL, WE HAVE A SAYING THAT IT IS UP TO THE DOERS TO
UNDO THE KNOW.

SEN. MANSFIELD: AGAIN, ALL I CAN COUNSEL IS PATIENCE. IT HAS BEEN
A DIFFICULT YEAR FOR US AND FOR YOU. THE SHANGHAI COMMUNIQUE WAS
SIGNED WITH GOOD FAITH ON BOTH SIDES AND THERE IS ONLY A STUMBLING
BLOCK ON THE ROAD TO FULL NORMALIZATION OF RELATIONS.

YOU MENTIONED THE JAPANESE FORMULA. UNDER THAT FORMULA, JAPAN
WITHDREW ITS RELATIONS WITH TAIWAN AND ESTABLISHED DIPLOMATIC
RELATIONS WITH PEKING. UNDER THAT FORMULA, JAPAN CONTINUED TO TRADE
WITH TAIWAN AND ITS TRADE WITH TAIWAN IS NOW LARGER THAN EVER BEFORE.
UNDER THE JAPANESE FORMULA, YOU DO HAVE A FORMULA FOR SUBTERFUGE
BECAUSE JAPAN HAS BENEFITTED TREMENDOUSLY. THERE ARE TRADE ORGANI-
ZATIONS IN TOKYO AND TAIPEI. THIS IS A SUBTERFUGE BECAUSE THE
JAPANESE ORGANIZATION IN TAIWAN IS HEADED BY A FORMER JAPANESE
AMBASSADOR AN I ASSUME THERE ARE FOREIGN SERVICE PERSONNEL IN THE
TAIWAN ORGANIZATION IN TOKYO. SO EVEN JAPAN HAS ITS INS AND OUTS
AND HAS NOT CUT THE KNOW COMPLETELY. THIS JAPANESE FORMULA IS NO
CLEARCUT SEPARATION OF RELATIONS WHICH CHINA APPARENTLY WANTS IN
ALL ASPECTS OF US RELATIONS WITH TAIWAN.

THAT IS THE BIG OBSTACLE THAT CONFRONTS BOTH OF US BEFORE FULL
NORMALIZATION CAN BE ACHIEVED. YOU RPOSITION IS CLEARCUT ALL THE
WAY THROUGH. I'M SURE YOU RECOGNIZE THE DIFFICULTY WHICH CONFRONTS
US, BUT ARE THERE ANY OTHER AREAS OF DIFFERENCES BETWEEN OUR TWO
COUNTRIES WHICH YOU THINK ARE OF SIGNIFICANCE?

MME WANG: (INITIALLY, THE INTERPRETER MIS-TRANSLATED SENATOR
MANSFIELD'S QUESTION AND MADAM WANG THOUGHT THAT HE WAS STILL
REFERRING TO TAIWAN. TANG WENSHENG CORRECTED THE INTERPRETER.)
WELL, AS TO OUR PRINCIPLED STAND ON TAIWAN, WE HAT STATED IT TIME
AND AGAIN AND WE HAVE MADE IT CLEAR, AND THERE IS NO ALTERNATIVE.
AS FOR OTHER DIFFERENCES, YOU MIGHT ASK PRESIDENT FORD OR SECRETARY
KISSINGER.

SEN. MANSFIELD; YOUR STAND ON TAIWAN IS CLEAR TO ALL, BUT WHAT
OTHER PROBLEMS ARE THERE BETWEEN US?

MME WANG: MAY I KNOW WHAT IS YOUR VIEW?

SEN. MANSFIELD: I AM ASKING THE QUESTION.

MME WANG: WILL WE BECOME FOOTBALL PLAYERS PASSING THE BALL BACK AND
FORTH? PERHAPS I CAN PLAY FULLBACK.

SEN. MANSFIELD: PERHAPS I CAN ANSWER MY OWN QUESTION.

PAGE 03        PEKING 02047  03 OF 04  091001Z

MME WANG: WELL, I FEEL, UNDER THE PRESENT STATE OF AFFAIRS, THE
STATE OF RELATIONS BETWEEN CHINA AND THE UNITED STATES COULD ONLY
BE WHAT IT IS AT THE MOMENT.

SEN. MANSFIELD: I TAKE IT, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF TAIWAN, THEY ARE
SATISFACTORY?

MME WANG: WELL, IN THE PRESENT WORLD OUR TWO COUNTRIES SHARE MANY
COMMON POINTS. TAIWAN IS A SMALL POINT. INTERNATIONAL ISSUES ARE
IN COMPARISON BIG ISSUES.

SEN. MANSIFLED: THERE ARE WORLD ISSUES AND THE CHINESE POSITION AS
LEADER OF THE THIRD WORLD NATIONS IS WELL KNOWN, AS IS CHINESE
SYMPATHY WITH UNDER-DEVELOPED NATIONS.

AS FAR AS THE QUESTION OF SINO-US TRADE IS CONCERNED, AFTER PRESIDENT
NIXON'S VISIT TRADE INTIALLY WAS HEAVILY IN OUR FAVOR, BUT THIS
SITUATION IS NOT ALLEVIATED AND THE TRADE BALANCE IS EVENING OUT.

WHILE WE WERE IN SINKIANG, CHINA EXPLODED ANOTHER NUCLEAR DEVICE.
THIS IS EVIDENCE OF GREAT PROGRESS, BUT CHINA'S POSITION IS NOT IN
FAVOR OF CONTROL OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS. CHINA, HOWEVER, IS IN FAVOR
OF COMPLETE DISARMAMENT. THIS COULD BE A CONTRADICTION. CHINA IS
ALSO IN FAVOR OF NON-FIRST USE OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS. I ALSO AGREE
WITH THIS STAND AND I DON'T BELIEVE IN FIRST STRIKES.

IN OIL, OUR IMPORTS CONSTITUTE APPROXIMATELY 50PCT OF OUR ANNUAL
REQUIREMENTS AND A GREAT DEAL IS WASTED. YOU, ON THE OTHER HAND, ARE
SELF-SUFFICIENT IN OIL. I ASSUME YOU HAVE TREMENDOUS RESERVES,
PARTICULARLY IN OFFSHORE OIL RESOURCES AND ON THE CONTINENTAL SHELF
AND IN THE POHAI GULF. YOU COULD BE AN OIL EXPORTING
NATION IF YOU DESIRED.

THERE ARE MAFY THINGS IN CHINA'S FAVOR. YOU ARE SELF-RELIANT IN
DEVELOPING YOUR OWN RESOURCES TO FILL YOUR OWN NEEDS. YOU REFUSED
OUTSIDE HELP AFTER THE TANSHAN EARTHQUAKE AND THIS WAS TO CHINA'S
CREDIT. I WISH OTHER COUNTRIES COULD BE AS SELF-RELIANT.

FRANKLY, I KNOW OF NO MAJOR DIFFERENCES OUTSIDE OF TAIWAN. I DON'T
THINK PRESIDENT FORED WOULD HAVE ASKED ME TO UNDERTAKE THIS MISSION
AND GIVEN ME A LETTER WHICH I SENT TO YOUR LIAISON OFFICE IN WASH-

INGTON, NOR WOULD THERE BE SO MANY EXCHANGES OF CONGRESSMEN AND
SCHOLARS UNLESS IT WAS THE DESIRE OF BOTH SIDES TO OBVIATE DIFFERENCE
S
AND REACH MUTUAL UNDERSTANDING IN ALL AREAS.

MME WANG: WE, INDEED, BELONG TO THE COUNTRIES OF THE THIRD WORLD,
BUT WE ARE NOT ITS LEADER AND WE DO NOT SEEK LEADERSHIP. CHAIRMAN
MAO TEACHES US NOT TO SEEK HEGEMONY AND WE MUST ACT RESOLUTELY IN
ACCORDANCE WITH THE INSTRUCTIONS OF CHAIRMAN MAO.

SEN. MANSFIELD: SOMETIMES YOU DON'T SEEK LEADERSHIP BUT IT IS
THRUST UPON YOU.

MME WANG: YOU HAVE VISITED JAPAN LATELY. MAY I HAVE YOUR OBSERVA-S

TIONS ON THE POLITICAL SCENE IN JAPAN AND ON JAPAN'S FOREIGN POLICY?

SEN. MANSFIELD: JAPAN'S FOREIGN POLICY IS TIED TO THE UNITED STATES,
AS YOU KNOW. AS LONG AS THAT TIE EXISTS, YOU WON'T HAVE A RESURGENCE
OF MILITARISM IN JAPAN. ON THE DOMESTIC SIDE, PRIME MINISTER MIKI

IS IN DIFFICULTY WITH HIS OWN PARTY PARTIALLY BECAUSE HE IS EXPOSING
THE LOCKHEED SCANDAL AS IT AFFECTS JAPAN'S BUSINESSMEN AND POLITICIANS.

WHETHER OR NOT MIKI WILLSURVIVE IS AN OPEN QUESTION, BUT HE HAS THE
PRESS AND THE PEOPLE WITH HIM AND I THINK HE HAS DONE A SUPERB JOB
UNDER DIFFICULT CIRCUMSTANCES.

ON THE ONE HAND, JAPAN IS CONCERNED WITH ITS FISHING RIGHTS ON THE
OPEN SEAS. ON THE OTHER HAND, IT IS CONCERNED WITH THE RUSSIAN
INCREASE IN NAVAL STRENGTH NOT ONLY ON THE SEAS NEAR JAPAN. JAPAN'S
STRENGTH LIES IN ITS ECONOMY AS AN INDISTRIAL NATION. IT RANKS
THIRD IN THE WORLD. IT HAS STRUGGLED WITH GRAVE INFLATION AND PRINCES
ARE SKY HIGH. THERE ARE NO CONTROLS ON INFLATION AS THERE ARE HERE.
BUT JAPAN IS COMPETITIVE IN ITS CAPITALISTIC MARKETS. IT ALSO
CARRIES ON A LARGE TRADE WITH THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA.

PERHAPS SENATOR GLENN COULD NOW ASK A QUESTION.

SEN. GLENN: I WOULD LIKE TO EXPRESS MY PERSONAL APPRECIATION FOR
THE HOSPITALITY SHOWN TO US DURING OUR VISIT TO CHINA. WE TRAVELED
FROM EAST TO WEST AND FROM NORTH TO SOUTH AND OUR TWO COUNTRIES ARE
VERY SIMILAR IN TOPOGRAPHY AND SIZE. WE HAVE SEEN THAT CHINA TAKES
A VERY PRACTICAL APPROACH TO ITS AGRICULTURE. THE CHINESE HAVE A
CONFIDENTIAL

CONFIDENTIAL

PAGE 02        PEKING 02047  04 OF 04  091021Z

REPUTATION FOR BEING VERY PRACTICAL AND CHAIRMAN MAO WAS A VERY
PRACTICAL MAN WHEN HE SAID THAT THE MAJOR PROBLEMS SHOULD BE FACED
NOW AND THAT MINOR PROBLEMS SHOULD BE DEALT WITH LATER. IT WOULD
APPEAR TO ME THAT TAIWAN SHOULD ALSO BE LOOKED AT IN THE CONTEXT OF
MAJOR AND MINOR PROBLEMS. I UNDERSTAND THE TIES OF PEOPLE AND LAND
THAT MAKE THIS A VERY AGGRAVATING PROBLEM FOR THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC
OF CHINA. IT IS A PROBLEM THAT MUST BE RESOLVED. TAIWAN IS NOT A
THREAT TO MAINLAND CHINA BUT MORE A THORN IN ITS SIDE THAT MUST BE
RESOLVED AT SOME DUTURE TIME. I SAY THAT IT IS ONLY A THORN IN THE
SIDE BECAUSE IT MUST SEEM THAT THERE IS A GUN AT CHINA'S HEAD WITH
ONE MILLION SOVIET TROOPS ON CHINA'S BORDER. IN THIS MATTER OF
RUSSIA, IT SEEMS THAT WE HAVE A COMMON CONCERN THAT UNITES OUR
COUNTRIES. I AGREE COMPLETELY THAT TAIWAN SHOULD BE RESOLVED, BUT
THE PROBLEM OF RUSSIA IS A REAL THREAT TO CHINA WHILE TAIWAN IS NOT.
WOULD YOU CARE TO COMMENT?

MME WANG: THE SHANGHAI COMMUNIQUE IS VERY CLEAR. IT STATED EXPLICITLY
THAT TAIWAN IS A PROVINCE OF CHINA AND THAT IT IS AN INALIENABLE
PART OF CHINA. AS TO WHEN AND HOW WE WILL LIBERATE TAIWAN, THAT
IS OUR OWN AFFAIR AND, SINCE IT IS OUR INTERNAL AFFAIR, NO ONE HAS
THE RIGHT TO INTERFERE. AS TO THE QUESTION OF THE THREAT TO CHINA
BY THE SOVIET UNION BEING THDMAJOR THREAT AGAINST CHINA, I DON'T
VIEW THE QUESTION IN THAT WAY. IT IS TRUE THAT THE SOVIET UNION IS A
THREAT TO CHINA, BUT ITS THREAT IS MAINLY DIRECTED AGAINST THE UNITED
STATES. THE UNITED STATES HAS MANY AREAS OF INTEREST TO DEFEND IN
ALL PARTS OF THE WORLD AND THE SOVIET UNION IS OUT FOR WORLD HEGEMONY
.
AND SUCH A SITUATION CAN NEVER BE CHANGED.

THE ISSUE OF TAIWAN IN COMPARISON TO WORLD ISSUES IS A MINOR ISSUE.
WORLD ISSUES ARE MAJOR. UNDER THE PRESENT SITUATION, WE SHARE MANY
COMMON POINTS AND WE MUST FACE OUR COMMON RASCAL (WANG PA TAN).

IN THE WEST AND IN THE UNITED STATES THERE IS AN APPEASEMENT THINKING
TOWARDS THE SOVIET UNION WHICH IS VERY DANGEROUS.

SEN. MANSFIELD: DO YOU MEAN DETENTE?

MME WANG: YES.

SEN. MANSFIELD: WHAT DO YOU THINK OF US TROOPS BEING STATIONED IN
CONFIDENTIAL

CONFIDENTIAL

PAGE 03        PEKING 02047  04 OF 04  091021Z

KOREA, OKINAWA AND THE PHILIPPINES?

MME WANG: IT HAS BEEN OUR CONSISTENT STAND TO OPPOSE THE STATIONING
OF TROOPS OR CONSTRUCTION OF MILITARY BASES ON ANY COUNTRY BY ANOTHER
COUNTRY. WE DO NOT HAVE ANY SOLDIERS STATIONED ABROAD.

SEN. MANSFIELD: WHAT ABOUT NATO, WOULD CHINA APPROVE OF THE WITH
DRAWAL OF TROOPS FROM WESTERN EUROPE?

MME WANG: THIS IS YOUR OWN AFFAIR AND WE HAVE NO SUGGESTIONS TO OFFER
.

AT THIS POINT MADAME WANG SUGGESTED THAT EVERYONE CALL IT A DAY AND
SAID THAT PROFESSOR CHOU PEI-YUAN WOULD LIKE TO INVITE EVERYONE TO
DINNER AS AN EXPRESSION OF FRIENDSHIP, SENTIMENT AND GOOD FEELING.
SHE ALSO MENTIONED THAT ON SATURDAY A VICE PREMIER (NAME UNSPECIFIED)
WOULD LIKE TO MEET AND HAVE A TALK WITH SENATOR MANSFIELD AND HIS
GROUP. SHE MENTIONED THAT IF THERE WERE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS, THEY
COULD BE RAISED WITH THE VICE PREMIER.

IN THE GENERAL DISCUSSION WHEN EVERYONE WAS TAKING THEIR LEAVE,
MADEAME WANG SAID TO SENATOR MANSFIELD THAT WE DO NOT SEEK TO HIDE
OUR VIEWS JUST BECAUSE OUR SOCIAL SYSTEMS ARE DIFFERENT.

YOU ARE OUR GUEST AND YOU HAVE TRAVELED A LONG WAY TO
VISIT US. AFTER TWO YEARS YOU HAVE RETURNED TO VISIT
SINKIANG AND KWANGTUNG. WHAT IS YOUR IMPRESSION OF
THESE PLACES.

SEN. MANSFIELD: I WAS VERY IMPRESSED. THIS WAS MY
FIRST VISIT TO SINKIANG. I FOUND CALM, COMPETENT PEOPLE
IN SINKIANG, INCLUDING THE MINORITY NATIONALITIES.
SINKIANG REMINDS MR. DIKEOS AND MYSELF OF OUR OWN STATE
OF MONTANA. THE TOPOGRAPHY AND PEOPLE AND PRODUCE ARE
COMPARABLE EXCEPT FOR SINKIANG'S PEANUT CROP. I WAS
ASTOUNDED WITH THE PROGRESS IN KWANGTUNG. I NOTICED
THE VAST INCREASE IN TRAFFIC IN PEKING AND THE WELL-
BEING OF THE PEOPLE. THERE HAS BEEN A LOT OF PROGRESS.
YOU HAVE COME A LONG WAY IN ACHIEVING STABILITY AND
ECONOMIC PROGRESS. THERE IS A LONG WAY STILL TO GO. WE
HAVE HAD A VERY HEARTENING EXPERIENCE. WE WERE WELL
RECEIVED EVERYWHERE. WE LEARNED A LOT MORE THAN WE KNEW.

MME WANG: ALL THIS PROGRESS HAS BEEN SCORED UNDER
THE CORRECT LEADERSHIP OF CHAIRMAN MAO, BY IMPLEMENTING
THE CORRECT LINES OF CHAIRMAN MAO AND BY THE GUIDANCE AND
BRILLIANCE OF CHAIRMAN MAO'S THOUGHT. OF COURSE
WHAT WE HAVE ACHIEVED IS NOT ENOUGH. IN THE DAYS AHEAD,
INHERITING THE BEQUEST OF CHAIRMAN MAO, WE WILL CONTINUE
THE REVOLUTIONARY CAUSE AND MARCH ALONG THE GREAT
REVOLUTIONARY COURSE CHARTED BY VMAIRMAN MAO,TO WIN AND
TO STRIVE FOR GREATER PROGRESS AND ACHIEVEMENTS. THE WHOLE
PARTY, ARMY AND PEOPLE IN OUR COUNTRY ARE DEEPLY GRIEVED
AT THE DEATH OF CHAIRMAN MAO. WE ARE DETERMINED TO
TURN GRIEF INTO STRENGTH AND TO RESPOND TO THE CALL OF
THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE, TO RALLY MORE CLOSELY AROUND THE
CENTRAL COMMITTEE. THE BRILLIANT THOUGHT OF MAO TSE-TUNG
WILL ALWAYS CONTINUE TO GUIDE US. WE WILL CONTINUE TO
MARCH ALONG THE COURSE CHARTED BY HIM AND WILL ALWAYS

WHEN EVERY ONE OF US RECOLLECTS HOW WE GREW UP AND
THE EARTHSHAKING CHANGES IN OUR MOTHERLAND AND THE
THRIVING SCENE OF OUR MOTHERLAND WE CAN NOT FORGET OUR
GREAT LEADER. THERE WOULD BE NO CHINA OF TODAY IF THERE
HAD BEEN NO CHAIRMAN MAO.

WHEN WE RECALL THE OPENING OF RELATIONS BETWEEN CHINA
AND THE UNITED STATES IT WAS ALSO CHAIRMAN MAO WHO
MADE THIS GREAT DECISION WHICH LED TO THE OPENING OF
RELATIONS WITH THE UNITED STATES. (AT THIS POINT MME
WANG WAS WEEPING AS WAS TANG, WEN-SHENG.)

SEN. MANSFIELD: WE ARE WELL AWARE OF THAT FACT.
WE HAVE SEEN THE GRIEF OF YOUR PEOPLE IN THIS YEAR OF
TRAGEDY BECAUSE OF THE DEATH OF CHOU EN-LAI, OF CHU TE
AND OTHER SMALLER EARTHQUAKES, BUT LIKE THE PHOENIX CHINA
WILL RISE OUT OF THIS TRAGEDY AND WILL TURN GRIEF INTO
STRENGTH AND PRODUCE MORE FOR ITS PEOPLE.

WHEN MRS. MANSFIELD AND I SAW CHOU EN-LAI A YEAR AGO,
HE TOLD US THE PERSON RESPONSIBLE FOR INITIATING
RELATIONS BETWEEN CHINA AND THE UNITED STATES WAS
CHAIRMAN MAO, WHO HAD READ AN ARTICLE IN THE &quot;FOREIGN
CONFIDENTIAL

CONFIDENTIAL

PAGE 02        PEKING 02047  02 OF 04  091011Z

AFFAIRS QUARTERLY&quot; WRITTEN BY NIXON BEFORE NIXON BECAME
PRESIDENT AND ON THE BASIS OF THAT ARTICLE THIS
RELATIONSHIP HAD BEEN BROUGHT ABOUT. THIS IS EVIDENCE
OF THE FORESIGHT OF CHAIRMAN MAO IN SEEKING NORMALIZATION
BETWEEN OUR TWO NATIONS. (AT THIS POINT THE INTERPRETER
WAS WEEPING AND WAS NOT TRANSLATING SENATOR MANSFIELD'S
WORDS EXACTLY.)

MME WANG: THAT IS TRUE.

SEN. MANSFIELD: MADAME VICE MINISTER, HOW DO YOU
THINK RELATIONS BETWEEN OUR TWO COUNTRIES SHAPE UP
AT THIS TIME?

MME WANG: MAY I KNOW YOUR OBSERVATIONS AND VIEWS ON
RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN OUR TWO COUNTRIES?

SEN. MANSFIELD; I BELIEVE THEY ARE PROGRESSING,
PERHAPS NOT AS FAST AS THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA OR
WE WOULD DESIRE. THE SHANGHAI COMMUNIQUE STATES UNEQUIVOCALLY
THAT THERE ARE NOT TWO CHINAS BUT ONE CHINA. THE
IMPLEMENTATION OF THE SHANGHAI COMMUNIQUE IS NOT AS FAST
AS SOME OF US WOULD LIKE BUT PROGRESS HAS BEEN MADE AND
WILL BE MADE. AFTER THE ELECTION PRESIDENT FORD OR MR.
CARTER WILL BE ABLE, ON THE BASIS OF A NEW FOUR-YEAR TERM,
TO GIVE THE KIND OF ATTENTION AND CONSIDERATION TO CHINA-U.S.
RELATIONS WHICH HAS NOT BEEN POSSIBLE LATELY BECAUSE OF
FACTORS YOU UNDERSTAND, INCLUDING THE SHORTNESS
OF PRESIDENT FORD'S TERM AFTER NIXON'S RESIGNATION, THE
PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN WHICH BEGAN ONE YEAR AGO AND THE
ELECTION WHICH ON NOVEMBER 2ND WILL DECIDE WHO WILL BE
PRESIDENT ON JANUARY 20, 1976.

MME WANG: ON THE QUESTION OF NORMALIZATION I WOULD
LIKE TO EXPRESS MY VIEWS ALEO. IN HIS REPORT TO THE
GOVERNMENT AT THE FOURTH NATIONAL PEOPLE'S CONGRESS
CHOU EN-LAI POINTED OUT THAT PROVIDED BOTH PARTIES
ABIDE BY THE PRINCIPLES OF THE SHANGHAI COMMUNIQUE,
SINO-AMERICAN RELATIONS CAN BE IMPROVED AND THIS POINT
WAS ALSO MENTIONED BY SENATOR MANSFIELD A FEW MINUTES AGO.
ON THE QUESTION OF NORMALIZATION I AM SURE THAT
CONFIDENTIAL

CONFIDENTIAL

PAGE 03        PEKING 02047  02 OF 04  091011Z

SENATOR MANSFIELD AND OTHER FRIENDS SITTING HERE ARE
VERY CLEAR ON WHAT OUR STAND IS. THAT IS THE JAPANESE
FORMULA AND ALSO THE THREE PRINCIPLES; NAMELY
1) ABROGATION OF THE TREATY; 2) WITHDRAWAL OF THE
AMERICAN TROOPS AND 3) SEVERANCE OF DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS.
FURTHERMORE, IT WILL NOT DO IF ANY ONE OF THESE
THREE PRINCIPLES IS MISSING AND IT ALSO WILL NOT DO
IF YOU UNDERTAKE ANY DISGUISED FORM. THERE IS NO
OTHER ALTERNATIVE. WE DO NOT BELIEVE IN SO-CALLED
PEACEFUL TRANSITION. AS CHAIRMAN MAO TEACHES US, IF YOU
DON'T USE A BROOM TO SWEEP DUST THE DUST WILL NOT RUN
AWAY ITSELF.
THE GROUP OF REACTIONARIES IN TAIWAN WILL NOT LAY DOWN
THEIR BUTCHERS' NIVES OF THEIR OWN ACCORD. THEREFORE,
WE DON'T BELIEVE IN PEACEFUL TJANSITION AND WE BASE
OKRSELVES ON A FOOTING TO FIGHT.

OF COURSE, WHEN WE SHALL LIBERATE TAIWAN IS OUR OWN
INTERNAL AFFAIR AND NO OTHER COUNTRY HAS THE RIGHT TO
INTERFERE. THIS STAND OF OURS HAS BEEN MADE CLEAR TO
MANY OF OUR AMERICAN FRIENDS.

SEN. MANSFIELD: WELL, I WOULDN'T DISAGREE ABOUT WHAT HAS BEEN
SAID ABOUT WHAT THE CHINESE POSITION IS. IT HAS BEEN REITERATED
MANY TIMES. IT WAS UNDERSTOOD WHEN CHOU EN-LAI AND NIXON SIGNED
THE SHANGHAI COMMUNIQUE AND IT WAS ANTICIPATED THEN, AND STILL IS,
THAT WHEN THE JOINING OF TAIWAN AND THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA
TAKES PLACE THAT WILL BE BY PEACEFUL MEANS.

AS WE ALL KNOW, THERE HAVE BEEN UPS AND DOWNS ON THE TAIWAN
QUESTION. AS FAR AS TROOP WITHDRAWALS ARE CONCERNED, THERE HAS
BEEN A
REDUCTION FROM OVER 10,000 TO LESS THAN 2,000. AS FAR AS
THE JAPANESE FORMULA IS CONCERNED, THAT WAS STATED IN THE LAST
VISIT IN  1974. I'M SURE, VICE MINISTER WANG, YOU RECOGNIZE THAT
ON OUR PART THERE ARE A LOT OF KNOTS TO BE UNTIED. THAT WILL TAKE
A LITTLE TIME. IN THEIR HISTORY, THE CHINESE HAVE BEEN NOTED FOR
THEIR PATIENCE AND FOR THEIR UNDERSTANDING OF PRACTICAL SITUATIONS,
AND I AM SURE YOU ARE AWARE THAT IT WILL TAKE MORE TIME TO UNTANGLE
THESE KNOTS BEFORE WE CAN ACHIEVE OUR GOAL OF NORMALIZATION.
FURTHERMORE, UNDER OUR CONSTITUTION THE PRESIDENT RATHER THAN THE
CONFIDENTIAL

CONFIDENTIAL

PAGE 04        PEKING 02047  02 OF 04  091011Z

CONGRESS MUST DO THIS. PRESIDENT FORD IN HONOLULU LAST YEAR STATED
THAT THE US GOAL WAS &quot;FULL NORMALIZATION OF RELATIONS WITH THE
PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA.&quot;

MME WANG: IF THIS QUESTION IS NOT SOLVED AND IF IT IS PROLONGED
THEN THE RESPONSIBILITY IS NOT ON THE SIDE OF CHINA, BUT ON THE
SIDE OF THE UNITED STATES.

EXDIS

SEN. MANSFIELD: I'VE INDICATED THAT THERE ARE MANY KNOTS TO UNTIE
AND THAT IT WILL TAKE TIME.

MME WANG: I THINK WE HAVE BEEN PATIENT ENOUGH. WE HAVE WAITED FOR
MORE THAN 27 YEARS NOW.

SEN. MANSFIELD: THAT IS A LONG TIME, BUT PRESIDENT NIXON VISITED
CHINA LESS THAN FIVE YEARS AGO AND THAT SHOULD BE TAKEN INTO CON-
SIDERATION AS WELL AS THE OVER 20-YEAR SPAN.

MME WANG: ON THIS ISSUE WE FEEL THAT IT IS THE UNITED STATES THAT
OWES US A DEBT AND IT IS NOT US WHO OWES THE US A DEBT.

SEN. MANSFIELD: WELL, I THINK IT'S UP TO THE UNITED STATES TO
FULFILL ITS PART OF THE SHANGHAI COMMUNIQUE.

MME WANG: WELL, WE HAVE A SAYING THAT IT IS UP TO THE DOERS TO
UNDO THE KNOW.

SEN. MANSFIELD: AGAIN, ALL I CAN COUNSEL IS PATIENCE. IT HAS BEEN
A DIFFICULT YEAR FOR US AND FOR YOU. THE SHANGHAI COMMUNIQUE WAS
SIGNED WITH GOOD FAITH ON BOTH SIDES AND THERE IS ONLY A STUMBLING
BLOCK ON THE ROAD TO FULL NORMALIZATION OF RELATIONS.

YOU MENTIONED THE JAPANESE FORMULA. UNDER THAT FORMULA, JAPAN
WITHDREW ITS RELATIONS WITH TAIWAN AND ESTABLISHED DIPLOMATIC
RELATIONS WITH PEKING. UNDER THAT FORMULA, JAPAN CONTINUED TO TRADE
WITH TAIWAN AND ITS TRADE WITH TAIWAN IS NOW LARGER THAN EVER BEFORE.
UNDER THE JAPANESE FORMULA, YOU DO HAVE A FORMULA FOR SUBTERFUGE
BECAUSE JAPAN HAS BENEFITTED TREMENDOUSLY. THERE ARE TRADE ORGANI-
ZATIONS IN TOKYO AND TAIPEI. THIS IS A SUBTERFUGE BECAUSE THE
JAPANESE ORGANIZATION IN TAIWAN IS HEADED BY A FORMER JAPANESE
AMBASSADOR AN I ASSUME THERE ARE FOREIGN SERVICE PERSONNEL IN THE
TAIWAN ORGANIZATION IN TOKYO. SO EVEN JAPAN HAS ITS INS AND OUTS
AND HAS NOT CUT THE KNOW COMPLETELY. THIS JAPANESE FORMULA IS NO
CLEARCUT SEPARATION OF RELATIONS WHICH CHINA APPARENTLY WANTS IN
ALL ASPECTS OF US RELATIONS WITH TAIWAN.

THAT IS THE BIG OBSTACLE THAT CONFRONTS BOTH OF US BEFORE FULL
NORMALIZATION CAN BE ACHIEVED. YOU RPOSITION IS CLEARCUT ALL THE
WAY THROUGH. I'M SURE YOU RECOGNIZE THE DIFFICULTY WHICH CONFRONTS
US, BUT ARE THERE ANY OTHER AREAS OF DIFFERENCES BETWEEN OUR TWO
COUNTRIES WHICH YOU THINK ARE OF SIGNIFICANCE?

MME WANG: (INITIALLY, THE INTERPRETER MIS-TRANSLATED SENATOR
MANSFIELD'S QUESTION AND MADAM WANG THOUGHT THAT HE WAS STILL
REFERRING TO TAIWAN. TANG WENSHENG CORRECTED THE INTERPRETER.)
WELL, AS TO OUR PRINCIPLED STAND ON TAIWAN, WE HAT STATED IT TIME
AND AGAIN AND WE HAVE MADE IT CLEAR, AND THERE IS NO ALTERNATIVE.
AS FOR OTHER DIFFERENCES, YOU MIGHT ASK PRESIDENT FORD OR SECRETARY
KISSINGER.

SEN. MANSFIELD; YOUR STAND ON TAIWAN IS CLEAR TO ALL, BUT WHAT
OTHER PROBLEMS ARE THERE BETWEEN US?

MME WANG: MAY I KNOW WHAT IS YOUR VIEW?

SEN. MANSFIELD: I AM ASKING THE QUESTION.

MME WANG: WILL WE BECOME FOOTBALL PLAYERS PASSING THE BALL BACK AND
FORTH? PERHAPS I CAN PLAY FULLBACK.

SEN. MANSFIELD: PERHAPS I CAN ANSWER MY OWN QUESTION.

MME WANG: WELL, I FEEL, UNDER THE PRESENT STATE OF AFFAIRS, THE
STATE OF RELATIONS BETWEEN CHINA AND THE UNITED STATES COULD ONLY
BE WHAT IT IS AT THE MOMENT.

SEN. MANSFIELD: I TAKE IT, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF TAIWAN, THEY ARE
SATISFACTORY?

MME WANG: WELL, IN THE PRESENT WORLD OUR TWO COUNTRIES SHARE MANY
COMMON POINTS. TAIWAN IS A SMALL POINT. INTERNATIONAL ISSUES ARE
IN COMPARISON BIG ISSUES.

SEN. MANSIFLED: THERE ARE WORLD ISSUES AND THE CHINESE POSITION AS
LEADER OF THE THIRD WORLD NATIONS IS WELL KNOWN, AS IS CHINESE
SYMPATHY WITH UNDER-DEVELOPED NATIONS.

AS FAR AS THE QUESTION OF SINO-US TRADE IS CONCERNED, AFTER PRESIDENT
NIXON'S VISIT TRADE INTIALLY WAS HEAVILY IN OUR FAVOR, BUT THIS
SITUATION IS NOT ALLEVIATED AND THE TRADE BALANCE IS EVENING OUT.

WHILE WE WERE IN SINKIANG, CHINA EXPLODED ANOTHER NUCLEAR DEVICE.
THIS IS EVIDENCE OF GREAT PROGRESS, BUT CHINA'S POSITION IS NOT IN
FAVOR OF CONTROL OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS. CHINA, HOWEVER, IS IN FAVOR
OF COMPLETE DISARMAMENT. THIS COULD BE A CONTRADICTION. CHINA IS
ALSO IN FAVOR OF NON-FIRST USE OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS. I ALSO AGREE
WITH THIS STAND AND I DON'T BELIEVE IN FIRST STRIKES.

IN OIL, OUR IMPORTS CONSTITUTE APPROXIMATELY 50PCT OF OUR ANNUAL
REQUIREMENTS AND A GREAT DEAL IS WASTED. YOU, ON THE OTHER HAND, ARE
SELF-SUFFICIENT IN OIL. I ASSUME YOU HAVE TREMENDOUS RESERVES,
PARTICULARLY IN OFFSHORE OIL RESOURCES AND ON THE CONTINENTAL SHELF
AND IN THE POHAI GULF. YOU COULD BE AN OIL EXPORTING
NATION IF YOU DESIRED.

THERE ARE MAFY THINGS IN CHINA'S FAVOR. YOU ARE SELF-RELIANT IN
DEVELOPING YOUR OWN RESOURCES TO FILL YOUR OWN NEEDS. YOU REFUSED
OUTSIDE HELP AFTER THE TANSHAN EARTHQUAKE AND THIS WAS TO CHINA'S
CREDIT. I WISH OTHER COUNTRIES COULD BE AS SELF-RELIANT.

FRANKLY, I KNOW OF NO MAJOR DIFFERENCES OUTSIDE OF TAIWAN. I DON'T
THINK PRESIDENT FORED WOULD HAVE ASKED ME TO UNDERTAKE THIS MISSION
AND GIVEN ME A LETTER WHICH I SENT TO YOUR LIAISON OFFICE IN WASH-

INGTON, NOR WOULD THERE BE SO MANY EXCHANGES OF CONGRESSMEN AND
SCHOLARS UNLESS IT WAS THE DESIRE OF BOTH SIDES TO OBVIATE DIFFERENCE
S
AND REACH MUTUAL UNDERSTANDING IN ALL AREAS.

MME WANG: WE, INDEED, BELONG TO THE COUNTRIES OF THE THIRD WORLD,
BUT WE ARE NOT ITS LEADER AND WE DO NOT SEEK LEADERSHIP. CHAIRMAN
MAO TEACHES US NOT TO SEEK HEGEMONY AND WE MUST ACT RESOLUTELY IN
ACCORDANCE WITH THE INSTRUCTIONS OF CHAIRMAN MAO.

SEN. MANSFIELD: SOMETIMES YOU DON'T SEEK LEADERSHIP BUT IT IS
THRUST UPON YOU.

MME WANG: YOU HAVE VISITED JAPAN LATELY. MAY I HAVE YOUR OBSERVA-S

TIONS ON THE POLITICAL SCENE IN JAPAN AND ON JAPAN'S FOREIGN POLICY?

SEN. MANSFIELD: JAPAN'S FOREIGN POLICY IS TIED TO THE UNITED STATES,
AS YOU KNOW. AS LONG AS THAT TIE EXISTS, YOU WON'T HAVE A RESURGENCE
OF MILITARISM IN JAPAN. ON THE DOMESTIC SIDE, PRIME MINISTER MIKI

IS IN DIFFICULTY WITH HIS OWN PARTY PARTIALLY BECAUSE HE IS EXPOSING
THE LOCKHEED SCANDAL AS IT AFFECTS JAPAN'S BUSINESSMEN AND POLITICIANS.

WHETHER OR NOT MIKI WILLSURVIVE IS AN OPEN QUESTION, BUT HE HAS THE
PRESS AND THE PEOPLE WITH HIM AND I THINK HE HAS DONE A SUPERB JOB
UNDER DIFFICULT CIRCUMSTANCES.

ON THE ONE HAND, JAPAN IS CONCERNED WITH ITS FISHING RIGHTS ON THE
OPEN SEAS. ON THE OTHER HAND, IT IS CONCERNED WITH THE RUSSIAN
INCREASE IN NAVAL STRENGTH NOT ONLY ON THE SEAS NEAR JAPAN. JAPAN'S
STRENGTH LIES IN ITS ECONOMY AS AN INDISTRIAL NATION. IT RANKS
THIRD IN THE WORLD. IT HAS STRUGGLED WITH GRAVE INFLATION AND PRINCES
ARE SKY HIGH. THERE ARE NO CONTROLS ON INFLATION AS THERE ARE HERE.
BUT JAPAN IS COMPETITIVE IN ITS CAPITALISTIC MARKETS. IT ALSO
CARRIES ON A LARGE TRADE WITH THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA.

PERHAPS SENATOR GLENN COULD NOW ASK A QUESTION.

SEN. GLENN: I WOULD LIKE TO EXPRESS MY PERSONAL APPRECIATION FOR
THE HOSPITALITY SHOWN TO US DURING OUR VISIT TO CHINA. WE TRAVELED
FROM EAST TO WEST AND FROM NORTH TO SOUTH AND OUR TWO COUNTRIES ARE
VERY SIMILAR IN TOPOGRAPHY AND SIZE. WE HAVE SEEN THAT CHINA TAKES
A VERY PRACTICAL APPROACH TO ITS AGRICULTURE. THE CHINESE HAVE A

REPUTATION FOR BEING VERY PRACTICAL AND CHAIRMAN MAO WAS A VERY
PRACTICAL MAN WHEN HE SAID THAT THE MAJOR PROBLEMS SHOULD BE FACED
NOW AND THAT MINOR PROBLEMS SHOULD BE DEALT WITH LATER. IT WOULD
APPEAR TO ME THAT TAIWAN SHOULD ALSO BE LOOKED AT IN THE CONTEXT OF
MAJOR AND MINOR PROBLEMS. I UNDERSTAND THE TIES OF PEOPLE AND LAND
THAT MAKE THIS A VERY AGGRAVATING PROBLEM FOR THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC
OF CHINA. IT IS A PROBLEM THAT MUST BE RESOLVED. TAIWAN IS NOT A
THREAT TO MAINLAND CHINA BUT MORE A THORN IN ITS SIDE THAT MUST BE
RESOLVED AT SOME DUTURE TIME. I SAY THAT IT IS ONLY A THORN IN THE
SIDE BECAUSE IT MUST SEEM THAT THERE IS A GUN AT CHINA'S HEAD WITH
ONE MILLION SOVIET TROOPS ON CHINA'S BORDER. IN THIS MATTER OF
RUSSIA, IT SEEMS THAT WE HAVE A COMMON CONCERN THAT UNITES OUR
COUNTRIES. I AGREE COMPLETELY THAT TAIWAN SHOULD BE RESOLVED, BUT
THE PROBLEM OF RUSSIA IS A REAL THREAT TO CHINA WHILE TAIWAN IS NOT.
WOULD YOU CARE TO COMMENT?

MME WANG: THE SHANGHAI COMMUNIQUE IS VERY CLEAR. IT STATED EXPLICITLY
THAT TAIWAN IS A PROVINCE OF CHINA AND THAT IT IS AN INALIENABLE
PART OF CHINA. AS TO WHEN AND HOW WE WILL LIBERATE TAIWAN, THAT
IS OUR OWN AFFAIR AND, SINCE IT IS OUR INTERNAL AFFAIR, NO ONE HAS
THE RIGHT TO INTERFERE. AS TO THE QUESTION OF THE THREAT TO CHINA
BY THE SOVIET UNION BEING THDMAJOR THREAT AGAINST CHINA, I DON'T
VIEW THE QUESTION IN THAT WAY. IT IS TRUE THAT THE SOVIET UNION IS A
THREAT TO CHINA, BUT ITS THREAT IS MAINLY DIRECTED AGAINST THE UNITED
STATES. THE UNITED STATES HAS MANY AREAS OF INTEREST TO DEFEND IN
ALL PARTS OF THE WORLD AND THE SOVIET UNION IS OUT FOR WORLD HEGEMONY
.
AND SUCH A SITUATION CAN NEVER BE CHANGED.

THE ISSUE OF TAIWAN IN COMPARISON TO WORLD ISSUES IS A MINOR ISSUE.
WORLD ISSUES ARE MAJOR. UNDER THE PRESENT SITUATION, WE SHARE MANY
COMMON POINTS AND WE MUST FACE OUR COMMON RASCAL (WANG PA TAN).

IN THE WEST AND IN THE UNITED STATES THERE IS AN APPEASEMENT THINKING
TOWARDS THE SOVIET UNION WHICH IS VERY DANGEROUS.

SEN. MANSFIELD: DO YOU MEAN DETENTE?

MME WANG: YES.

SEN. MANSFIELD: WHAT DO YOU THINK OF US TROOPS BEING STATIONED IN
CONFIDENTIAL

CONFIDENTIAL

PAGE 03        PEKING 02047  04 OF 04  091021Z

KOREA, OKINAWA AND THE PHILIPPINES?

MME WANG: IT HAS BEEN OUR CONSISTENT STAND TO OPPOSE THE STATIONING
OF TROOPS OR CONSTRUCTION OF MILITARY BASES ON ANY COUNTRY BY ANOTHER
COUNTRY. WE DO NOT HAVE ANY SOLDIERS STATIONED ABROAD.

SEN. MANSFIELD: WHAT ABOUT NATO, WOULD CHINA APPROVE OF THE WITH
DRAWAL OF TROOPS FROM WESTERN EUROPE?

MME WANG: THIS IS YOUR OWN AFFAIR AND WE HAVE NO SUGGESTIONS TO OFFER
.

AT THIS POINT MADAME WANG SUGGESTED THAT EVERYONE CALL IT A DAY AND
SAID THAT PROFESSOR CHOU PEI-YUAN WOULD LIKE TO INVITE EVERYONE TO
DINNER AS AN EXPRESSION OF FRIENDSHIP, SENTIMENT AND GOOD FEELING.
SHE ALSO MENTIONED THAT ON SATURDAY A VICE PREMIER (NAME UNSPECIFIED)
WOULD LIKE TO MEET AND HAVE A TALK WITH SENATOR MANSFIELD AND HIS
GROUP. SHE MENTIONED THAT IF THERE WERE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS, THEY
COULD BE RAISED WITH THE VICE PREMIER.

IN THE GENERAL DISCUSSION WHEN EVERYONE WAS TAKING THEIR LEAVE,
MADEAME WANG SAID TO SENATOR MANSFIELD THAT WE DO NOT SEEK TO HIDE
OUR VIEWS JUST BECAUSE OUR SOCIAL SYSTEMS ARE DIFFERENT.

3. FOR USUN: PLEASE PASS THIS MESSAGE TO AMBASSADOR GATES UPON
HIS ARRIVAL IN NEW YORK.
