		<h3>Tor</h3>
		<p><a href="https://www.torproject.org">Tor</a> is an encrypted anonymising network that makes it harder to intercept internet communications, or see where communications are coming from or going to.</p>
		<p>In order to use the WikiLeaks public submission system as detailed above you can download the Tor Browser Bundle, which is a Firefox-like browser available for Windows, Mac OS X and GNU/Linux and pre-configured to connect using the anonymising system Tor.</p>
		<h4>Tails</h4>
		<p>If you are at high risk and you have the capacity to do so, you can also access the submission system through a secure operating system called <a href="https://tails.boum.org">Tails</a>. Tails is an operating system launched from a USB stick or a DVD that aim to leaves no traces when the computer is shut down after use and automatically routes your internet traffic through Tor. Tails will require you to have either a USB stick or a DVD at least 4GB big and a laptop or desktop computer.</p>

		<h3>Tips</h3>
		<p>Our submission system works hard to preserve your anonymity, but we recommend you also take some of your own precautions. Please review these basic guidelines. </p>
		<div>
			<h4>1. Contact us if you have specific problems</h4>
			<p>If you have a very large submission, or a submission with a complex format, or are a high-risk source, please <a href="#submit_help_contact">contact us</a>. In our experience it is always possible to find a custom solution for even the most seemingly difficult situations.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h4>2. What computer to use</h4>
			<p>If the computer you are uploading from could subsequently be audited in an investigation, consider using a computer that is not easily tied to you. Technical users can also use <a href="https://tails.boum.org">Tails</a> to help ensure you do not leave any records of your submission on the computer.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h4>3. Do not talk about your submission to others</h4>
			<p>If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in source protection – it is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This includes other media organisations.</p>
		</div>

	</div>

		<h3>After</h3>

		<div>
			<h4>1. Do not talk about your submission to others</h4>
			<p>If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in source protection – it is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This includes other media organisations.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h4>2. Act normal</h4>
			<p>If you are a high-risk source, avoid saying anything or doing anything after submitting which might promote suspicion. In particular, you should try to stick to your normal routine and behaviour.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h4>3. Remove traces of your submission</h4>
			<p>If you are a high-risk source and the computer you prepared your submission on, or uploaded it from, could subsequently be audited in an investigation, we recommend that you format and dispose of the computer hard drive and any other storage media you used.</p>
			<p>In particular, hard drives retain data after formatting which may be visible to a digital forensics team and flash media (USB sticks, memory cards and SSD drives) retain data even after a secure erasure. If you used flash media to store sensitive data, it is important to destroy the media.</p>
			<p>If you do this and are a high-risk source you should make sure there are no traces of the clean-up, since such traces themselves may draw suspicion.</p>
			<div>
				<h4>4. If you face legal action</h4>
				<p>If a legal action is brought against you as a result of your submission, there are organisations that may help you. The Courage Foundation is an international organisation dedicated to the protection of journalistic sources. You can find more details at <a href="https://www.couragefound.org">https://www.couragefound.org</a>.</p>

		<p>WikiLeaks publishes documents of political or historical importance that are censored or otherwise suppressed. We specialise in strategic global publishing and large archives.</p>
		<p>The following is the address of our secure site where you can anonymously upload your documents to WikiLeaks editors. You can only access this submissions system through Tor. (See our <a href="#submit_help_tor">Tor tab</a> for more information.) We also advise you to read our <a href="#submit_help_tips">tips for sources</a> before submitting.</p>

			<!--<div>
				Copy this address into your Tor browser. Advanced users, if they wish, can also add a further layer of encryption to their submission using <a href="#submit_wlkey">our public PGP key</a>.
			</div>-->
		</div>

		<p>If you cannot use Tor, or your submission is very large, or you have specific requirements, WikiLeaks provides several alternative methods. <a href="#submit_help_contact">Contact us</a> to discuss how to proceed.</p>

SITUATION IN CHINA. ACCORDINGLY, I WILL FIRST
DEVOTE A FEW REMARKS TO THE DOMESTIC SITUATION HERE.
4. 1977 HAS JUST PASSED. 1976 WAS NOT AN ORDINARYP
YEAR AND THERE WERE GREAT CHANGES UNDER THE LEADERSHIP OF CHAIRMAN HUA KUO-FENG THE GANG OF FOUR COUNTER
REVOLUTIONARY CONSPIRATORY CLIQUE WAS SMASHED. WE
WERE ABLE TO AVOID A MAJOR SPLIT. PERHAPS WE
SUCCEEDED IN AVOIDING CIVIL WAR. AFTER THE OVERTHROW OF THE GANG OF FOUR, 1977 WAS A MAJOR TURNING
POINT IN OUR FORTUNES. IN OTHER WORDS, IN 1977
CHINA ENTERED A NEW PERIOD OF GREAT DEVELOPMENT.
5. PRIOR TO THEIR OVERTHROW, THE GANG OF FOUR
CONTROLLED A PORTION OF STATE POWER WHICH THEY EXPLOITED AND CAUSED GREAT DAMAGE TO THE POLITICAL,
IDEOLOGICAL AND ECONOMIC HEALTH OF THE COUNTRY.
6. IN 1976 WE ALSO LOST OUR THREE GREAT LEADERS.
THE PEOPLE AND THE PARTY FELT IMMENSE GRIEF. MAO,
CHOU EN-LAI AND CHU TEH AND THE OTHER OLD LEADERS
LED THE PEOPLE IN THEIR STRUGGLE FOR
INDEPENDENCE AGAINST IMPERIALISM AND BUREAUCRATIC
CAPITALISM TO ESTABLISH A NEW PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC
OF CHINA. THE PRC WAS FOUNDED AFTER OUR LEADERS
HAD LED THE PEOPLE THROUGH MANY DIFFICULTIES AND THE

COUNTRY AAD EXPERIENCED MANY TWISTS AND TURNS AS THE
PEOPLE STRIVED TO BUILD SOCIALSIM. DURING THE
DIFFICULT PERIOD AFTER THE PASSING OF OUR THREE
GREAT LEADERS, THE GANG OF FOUR ENGAGED IN A FRENZIED EFFORT TO USURP POWER. OUR NEWSPAPERS HAVE
ALREADY CARRIED MUCH INFORMATION ON THIS AND PERHAPS
THERE IS NO NEED TO GO INTO IT. DURING THE PERIOD
OF THE GREAT PROLETARIAN CULTURAL REVOLUTION, THE
GANG OF FOUR AND LIN PAIO ENGAGED IN DESTRUCTIVE
ACTIVITIES. AT THAT TIME WE SAW THE EVIL DOINGS
OF LIN PIAO AND THE GANG OF FOUR JUST AS INDIVIDUAL
MISTAKES AND DEVIATIONS. OVER A LONG PERIOD
HOWEVER, CHAIRMAN MAO LED THE PARTY AGAINST LIN
PIAO. AFTERWARDS HE LED THE PARTY AGAINST THE GANG
OF FOUR AND SYSTEMATICALLY CRITICIZED THE.
7. CHAIRMAN MAO PROVIDED US WITH THE THREE GREAT
PRINCIPLES AGAINST SPLITTISM AND CHARGED THE GANG OF
FOUR WITH VIOLATING THESE PRINCIPLES. HE CRITICIZED
THE GANG OF FOUR AT MEETINGS OF THE POLITBURO AND
POINTED OUT THAT CHIANG CHING HAD WILD AMBITIONS.
SHE WANTED WANG HUNG-WEN TO BECOME CHAIRMAN OF THE

COUNTRY AND SHE HERSELF TO BECOME CHAIRMAN OF THE
PARTY. CHAIRMAN MAO WARNED US OF THIS.
8. CHOU EN-LAI WAS ALSO A VICTIM OF ATTACKS BY THE
GANG OF FOUR. THEY ATTEMPTED TOSUPPLANT HIM AND
TO FORM THEIR OWN CABINET. CHAIRMAN MAO, HOWEVER,
EXPRESSED A DETERMINATION TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM OF
THE GANG OF FOUR IF NOT DURING THAT YEAR, THEN IN
THE NEXT. HE ARRANGED TO BAR THE GANG OF FOUR IN
THEIR EFFORTS TO USURP SUPREME POWER OVER THE
PARTY AND THE STATE. WHEN CHOU WAS CRITICALY ILL
CHAIRMAN MAO APPOINTED TENG HSIAO-PINT TO PRESIDE
OVER THE DAY TO DAY WORK OF THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE,

CENTRAL COMMITTEE AND THE MAN IN CHARGE OF THE DAY
TO DAY OPERATIONS OF THE STATE COUNCIL AND THE
CENTRAL COMMITTEE. HE TOLD HUA KUO-FENG THAT WITH
HUA IN CHARGE HE WAS AT EASE.
9. CHARMAN MAO MADE CLEAR HIS INTENTION TO CHOOSE
HUA AS HIS SUCCESSOR. HE WAS DETERMINED NOT TO LET
THE GANG OF FOUR GET CONTROL OVER THE LEADERSHIP.
IN THIS SITUATION, THE GANG OF FOUR HAD NO WAY OUT
BUT TO RESORT TO SCHEMING AND PLOTTING. THEY
ATTEMPTED TO DESTROY MARXISM-LENINISM AND THE
THOUGHTS OF CHAIRMAN MAO, CREATE CONFUSION AND
TOPPLE DOWN THE LEADERSHIP FROM THE CENTER DOWN TO
THE LOCAL LEVEL. WHEN CHAIRMAN MAO WAS ILL AND PARTICULARLY AFTER HE DIED, THEIR EFFORTS BECAME EVEN MORE
FRENZIED. THEY TRIED TO CREATE THE IMPRESSION THAT
ALL VETERAN CADRES WERE DEMOCRATS (SIC). THEY
FOUND IT DIFFICULT TO CREATE A FOOTHOLD IN THE
MILITARY AND THUS THEY ATTEMPTED TO MAKE A SECOND
MILITARY FORCE OUT OF THE MILITIA. THEY EVEN DISTRIBUTED
GUNS AND AMMUNITION TO THE MILITIA FOR THE PREPARATIONS OF A COUP
D'ETAT. THE SITUATION WAS VERY TENSE AFTER CHAIRMAN
MAO DIED. THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE LED BY HUA KUO-FENG DECIDED
TO ARREST THE GANG OF FOUR WHO WERE IN A MINORITY
IN THE POLITBURO AND WERE AN EVEN SMALLER FORCE IN THE
CENTRAL COMMITTEE ITSELF.
10. AFTER THE ARREST OF THE GANG OF FOUR AND THE
FRUSTRATION OF THEIR SCHEMES, THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE
MADE KNOWN THEIR PLANS SO PEOPLE AND THE

OF CHARMAN MAO'S CRITICISM MET WITH A WARM RECEPTION
FROM THE PEOPLE. WE SAY THAT THE SMASHING OF THE GANG
OF FOUR WAS A GREAT VICTORY, A VICTORY ACHIEVED
WITHOUT A DROP OF BLOODSHED OR A SHOT FIRED.
MILLIONS OF PEOPLE CELEBRATED, EVEN IN SHANGHAI
WHICH HAD BEEN A CENTER OF THE GANG OF FOUR'S
ACTIVITIES. THERE WERE TWO RASONS WHY WE ACHIEVED
VICTORY OVER THE GANG OF FOUR. FIRST, THE EFFORTS
OF CHAIRMAN MAO HIMSELF. SECOND, THE FACT THAT THE
PEOPLE,ARMY AND PARTY, HAD BEEN TEMEPERED IN STRUGGLE
SUCH AS THE GREAT PROLETARIAN CULTURAL REVOLUTION.
SO THAT THEY HAVE HIGH POLITICAL CONSCIOUSNESS.
11. TWENTIY-EIGHT YEARS HAVE ELAPSED SINCE THE
PEOPLE'S REUBLIC OF CHINA WAS FOUNDED IN 1949.
APART FROM THE POLITICAL FIELD THERE HAS BEEN
CONSIDERABLE DEVELOPMENT ECONOMICALLY TOO. CHINA,
HOWEVER, IS STILL DEVELOPING AND IS STILL VERY BACKWARD. OWING TO THE SABOTAGE OF THE GANG OF FOUR
WE HAVE UNDERGONE A LONG PERIOD OF STAGNATION,
ESPECIALLY IN OUR INDUSTRY. CHAIRMAN HUA HAS TOLD US TO

IN THE POSITION YOUR GOVERNMENT MIGHT TAKE SHOULD
THE SECURITY COUNCIL PASS A RESOLUTION ON ECONOMIC
SANCTIONS AGAINST SOUTH AFRICA. FINALLY, I WAS
CURIOUS AS TO WHETHER CHINA MIGHT SUPPORT THE
BRITISH AND AMERICAN INITIATIVE ON RHODESIA.
14. HUANG: AFRICA HAS BEEN A VERY TROUBLED AREA
IN 1977. BESIDES BEING ENGAGED IN MANY ACTIVITIES
IN THE MIDDLE EAST AND THE MEDITERRANANEN THE
SOVIET UNION IS ALSO INVOLVED IN MANY OFFENSIVE
ACTIVITIES IN AFRICA. SOVIET ACTIVITY IS PART
OF A WORLDWIDE HEGEMONISTIC PLAN. AFTER THEIR
TEMPORARY SUCCESS IN ANGOLA, THE SOVIET UNION
INTENDS TO USE THAT COUNTRY AS A BASE FOR ITS
MERCENARY FORCES' INVASION OF ZAIRE AND TO STICK
THEIR HANDS INTO THE ZIMBABWE SITUATION AS PART OF
THEIR PLAN FOR WORLD HEGEMONY. THE SOVIET UNION
WANTS TO CONTROL ROUTES INTO THE INDIAN OCEAN AND THE
SOUTHERN ATLANTIC. THIS IS PART OF THEIR PLAN OF
DEPLOYMENT FOR THE FINAL BATTLE FOR WORLD HEGEMONY.

APART FROM THAT THE SOVIETS IN THE HORN OF AFRICA
ARE ATTEMPTING TO CONTROL EHTIOPIA AND SOMALIA.
THEY HAVE GRANTED MILITARY ASSISTANCE IN AN ATTEMPT
TO CONTROL ETHIOPIA AND ALSO WISH TO COME BACK TO
SOMALIA IN ORDER TO DOMINATE THE RED SEA. THEIR
STRATEGY IN THE MIDDLE EAST IS TO CONTROL THE FLOW
OF RESOURCES, IN OTHER WORDS, OIL. IF THEY ARE ABLE
TO GAIN CONTROL OVER THE OIL OF THE MIDDLE EAST

THEY WILL BE ABLE TO SUFFOCATE WESTERN EUROPE AND
BRING THE EUROPEANS TO THEIR KNEES WITHOUT WAR. THE
SOVIET UNION HARBORS WILD AMBITIONS.

15. THE FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEM IS HOW TO SUPPORT THE
JUST DEMANDS OF THE AFRICANS AND PALESTINIAN
PEOPLE AGAINST HEGEMONISM. OUR APPROACH DIFFERS
FROM THAT OF THE US. THE US PAYS EXCESSIVE ATTENTION
TO THE MILITARYASPECTS OF THE PROBLEM. YOU WANT TO
USE SOUTH AFRICAN AND RHODESIAN MILITARY FORCES TO
COUNTER THE SOVIET UNION. IN THE MIDDLE EAST YOU
DEPEND EXCESSIVELY ON ISRAELI MILITARY
FORCE TO COUNTER THAT OF THE ARABS AND THE SOVIET
UNION. HOWEVER, SMITH AND VORSTER IN SOUTH AFRICA
ARE A NET MINUS FOR THE US. ISRAEL'S OBDURATE AND
IRRATIONAL POLICIES ARE ALSO NET MINUSES FOR THE US
IN THE MIDDLE EAST. WE HOPE THAT IF THE US AS WELL
AS ITS ALLIES WERE TO RESULUTELY SUPPORT THE JUST
DEMANDS OF THE AFRICANS AND ARABS IT MIGHT BE
POSSIBLE TO MAINTAIN THE US POSITIONIN THE AREAS
AND THE SITUATION WOULD BE MORE STABLE. HOWEVER,
US SUPPORT FOR A RECALCITRANT ZIONIST REGIME WHICH
BRUTALLY REPRESSES THE ARAB PEOPLE ONLY ENDANGERS
THESE GOVERNMENTS WHICH GENUINELY OPPOSE SOVIET
EXPANSIONISM, SUCH AS THAT OF EGYPTIAN PRESIDENT
SADAT. WE HAVE NOTED SOME CHANGES IN THIS AREA BUT
THEY ARE NOT SUFFICIENT TO MEET THE STRATEGIC DEMANDS.

16. WITH REGARD TO THE PROBLEM OF SOUTH AFRICA,
MANY COUNTRIES HAVE RAISED THE DEMAND THAT THE SECURITY
COUNCIL ADOPT MILITARY AND ECONOMIC SANCTIONS
AGAINST SOUTH AFRICA. THESE JUST DEMANDS SHOULD BE
SUPPORTED.
17. IT IS DIFFICULT TO SAY WHETHER THE US AND BRITISH
PROPOSAL FOR RHODESIA IS ACHIEVING ANY SUCCESS. THE
SOVIET UNION HAS INTERFERED IN THE LIBERATION STRUGGLE
ON A LARGE SACLE. THE US INTENDS TO PRECLUDE SOVIET
INTERFERENCE BUT THERE AARE DIFFICULTIES. POSSIBLY
THE US AND BRITISH PLAN CANNOT TAKE EFFECT FOR A
LONG TIMEBECAUSE INSUFFICIENT PRESSURE HAS BEEN
APPLIED ON SMITH AND NOT ENOUGH ATTENTION PAID TO THE
BLACK AFRICANS IN RHODESIA.

THE MIDDLE EAST.
20. HUANG: I ASSUME BEFOREHAND THAT YOU ARE ALL
CLEAR ON CHINESE POSITION WITH REGARD TO ISSUES IN
THE MIDDLE EAST. WE HAVE SUGGESTED TO THE US THAT
IT ADOPT A POLICY OF USING TWO HANDS. ONE HAND SHOULD
SUPPORT THE EXISTENCE OF IRAEL. THE OTHER SHOULD

DRIFTING FURTHERAND FURTHER AWAY.

AFRICA. THIS MEANS THAT THE US PREFERS PEACEFUL
MEANS TO RESOLVE AFRICA'S PROBLEMS. WITH REGARD

22. HUANG: THE ROOT SOURCE IS RIVALRY BETWEEN THE
TWO SUPERPOWERS. FIRST, THE SOVIET UNION WANTED TO
CONTROL SOMALIA AND MAINTAIN BASES THERE. THEN THEY
CAPITALIZED ON THE SITUATION EXISTING BETWEEN THE
TWO COUNTRIES.
23. RICHMOND. WE HAVE JUST TALKED TO AMBASSADOR
HAO ON THE ISSUE OF NORMALIZATION OF RELATIONS BETWEEN THE US AND THE PRC. ARE THERE OTHER AREAS
BESIDES THE TAIWAN ISSUE IN WHICH OUR RELATIONS
MIGHT BE NORMALIZE? IN OTHER WORDS, COULD THERE
BE EXPANDED CONTACTS IN TRADE, INDUSTRY, AGRICULTURE,
AND CULTURAL EXCHANGES?
24. HUANG: THE CRUCIAL POINT IN NORMLAIZATION IS
THE TAIWAN PROBLEM. THERE IS NO WAY TO AVOID THIS.
SINCE PRESIDENT NIXON IN 1972 VISITED CHINA AND SIGNED
THE SHANGHAI COMMUNIQUE OUR RELATIONS HAVE DEVELOPED
STEADILY AND THAT IS A GOOD DEVELOPMENT. ACTUALLY
NIXON THEN VISUALIZEED THE NORMALIZATION OF RELATIONS
IN THE MIDDLE OF HIS SECOND TERM BUT THERE EMERGED

PEKING 00066 03 OF 03 070952Z

CERTAIN POLITICAL PROBLEMS WHICH LED TO THE POSTPONING OF NORMALIZATION. THE POSITION TAKEN BY CHINA
IS THAT TAIWAN IS PART OF CHINA AND THAT THE RETURN
OF TAIWAN IS AN INTEGRAL PART OF THE UNIFICATION OF
THE WHOLE COUNTRY. ALL THE PEOPLE IN CHINA ARE
FAMILIAR WITH THE SLOGAN THAT WE ARE DETERMINED TO
LIBERATE TAIWAN. IT IS A PROMISE BY THE PARTY AND
GOVERNMENT TO THE PEOPLE. HOW THIS IS DONE AND
WHEN IS NOT A SUBJECT TO BE INCLUDED IN NEGOTIATIONS
WITH FOREIGN COUNTRIES. WE HAVE MADE CLEAR OUR
VIEWS ON THIS POINT TO OUR AMERICAN FRIENDS. WE
HAVE INFORMED YOU OF THE THREE PRINCIPLES FOR THE
RESOLUTION OF THE TAIWAN PROBLEM. THE US, HOWEVER,
HAS NOT MADE UP ITS MIND. WE CAN WAIT, BUT NOT
INDEFINITELY. OUR AMERICAN FRIENDS HAVE PUT FORWARD
A STRING OF PROPOSALS. THE CENTRAL PART OF THESE
PROPOSALS IS THE IDEA THAT THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT
IS NOT TO USE FORCE. FRANKLY THIS CONSITUTES
INTERFERENCE IN CHINA'S INTERNAL AFFAIRS AND IS A
TWO CHINAS CONCEPT WHICH WE CANNOT ACCEPT.
25. MEANWHILE OTHER ASPECTS OF OUR RELATIONSHIP

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
CAN CONTINUE TO DEVELOP ACCORDING TO THE SHANGHAI
COMMUNIQUE. THESE INCLUDE CULTURAL EXCHANGES AND

DEVELOPMENTS IN ALL THESE FIELDSS HAVE THEIR LIMITS.
I RECALL WHEN THE COMMITTEE FOR THE PRESENT
DANGER WAS HERE WE DISCUSSED FOREIGN TRADE AND THE
SALE OF A CERTAIN COMPUTER WHICH MR. PACKARD SAID
THE STATE DEPARTMENT HAD NOT GRANTED PRMISSION FOR

ADVERSARY AND PUTS CHINA IN THE SAME POSITION AS THE

26. THE PROBLEM OF ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT IN CHINA WAS
DISCUSSED AT THE 11TH CENTRAL COMMITTEE MEETING AND
THE 5TH NATIONAL PEOPLE'S CONGRESS WILL NO DOUBT
REITARATE THAT WE ARE RESOLVED TO REALIZE THE
&quot;FOUR MODERNIZATIONS&quot; BY THE YEAR 2000. WE ARE
WILLING TO ENTER INTO COOPERATION WITH FOREIGN
COUNTRIES BUT OUR FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLE REMAINS
SELF-RELIANCE. WE DO NOT REST OUR PLANS FOR ACHIEVING
THE FOUR MODERNIZATIONS ON THE BAASIS OF THE IMPORTATION OF WHOLE PLANTS OR TECHNOLOGY FROM FOREIGN
COUNTRIES. I SUGGEST THAT YOU MIGHT GO INTO MORE
DETAIL ON THIS POINT WITH MINISTER OF FOREIGN TRADE
LI CHIANG.
27. HART: I HAVETWO POINTS. FIRST, THE US CONGRESS IS NOW PLAYING A GREATER ROLE IN THE FORMULATION OF FOREIGN POLICY. IT MAY BE DIFFICULT FOR
OUR FRIENDS TO UNDERSTAND BUT WE SHOULD MAKE CLEAR
THAT CONGRESSIONAL COMMITTEES CANNOT DICTATE FOREIGN
POLICY BUT ARE GOING TO ASSUME A LARGER ROLE
IN ITS FORMULATION. SECONDLY, OUR NEGOTIATIONS WITH
THE SOVIET UNION ON THE LIMITATION OF STRATEGIC
ARMS HAVE BEEN INTERPRETED BY OUR GOVERNMENT
AND OTHERS AS DEMONSTRATING WEAKNESS AND MISUNDERSTANDING
OF THE SOVIET THREAT. BOTH THE AMINISTRATION AND
CONGRESS REALIZE THAT THE SOVIET UNION MIGHT NOT
LIVE UP TO ITS GREEMENTS. AND WE KNOW THAT WE
SHOULD NOT LET DOWN OUR GUARD WITH RESPECT TO
CONVENTIONAL WARFARE. EVEN IF WE DO ACHIEVE A SALT

ON YOUR REMARKS. THE SOVIETS AND THE US ARE ENGAGED
IN A RIVALRY FOR HEGEMONY. THIS IS AN OBJECTIVE
FACT. SECRETARY VANCE HIMSELF HAS SAID THAT
COMPETITION BETWEEN THE US AND THE SOVIET UNION IS
AN OBJECTIVE FACT. WE SAY THAT THIS IS A CONTRADICTION WHICH IS IRRECONCILABLE. DESPITE NEGOTIATIONS
BOTH ARE NOW PREPARING FOR WAR. PAST EXPERIENCE HAS
SHOWN THAT NEGOTIATIONS ARE UNABLE TO PREVENT CMPETITION IN ACCUMULATING ARMS. YOU HAVE BEEN UNABLE
TO CHECK THE MOMENTUM IN THE SOVIET BUILDUP. THE
US HAS IMPORTANT INTERESTS TO PROTECT AND THE
SOVIETS WANT TO EXPAND. THE RIVALRY IS BOUND TO LEAD
TO WAR. YOU MIGHT THINK THAT IS AVOIDABLE. WE
DIVERGE FROM THIS VIEW. THIRTY-TWO YEARS HAVE ALREADY
PASSED SINCE WORLD WAR II. WE DO NOT BELIEVE IN
LASTING PEACE. IN OUR VIEW WAR WILL BREAK OUT SOONER
OR LATER. THIS WILL NOT BE THROUGH ANY DESIRE
OF THE THIRD WORLD NOR THE SECOND WORLD. THESE
COUNTRIES DO NOT HAVE THE STRENGTH AND NEED A PEACEFUL ENVIRONMENT TO BUILD UPTHEIR ECONOMIES. WE
HOPE PEACE CAN CONTINUE AS LONG AS POSSIBLE BUT MUST
BE VIGILANT IN OUR PREPARATIONS FOR WAR. WE TELL
OUR PEOPLE IF WAR SHOULD BREAK OUT WE WILL PREPARE
FOR IT. SHOULD IT COME EITHER EARLY OR LATE OR
BY NUCLEAR OR CONVENTIONAL. I DO NOT MEAN THAT
CHINA IS BELLICOSE BUT THAT WE MUST PREPARE FOR A
WAR THAT MIGHT BE IMPOSED ON US. WE HAVE NEITHER
SOLDIERS NOR BASES ABROAD. WE HAVE NO INTENTION TO
BECOME A SUPERPOWER. THIS IS WRITTEN INTO OUR
PARTY'S RESLUTIONS AND INTO OUR CONSTITUTION. WITH
REGARD TO YOU SECOND POINT. WE MUST RESOLUTELY

EASY FOR THE SOVIETS TO GO TO WAR. ON THE OTHER
HAND YOUHAVE TO GO THROUGH VARIOUS CONSTITUTIONAL

SITUATION IN CHINA. ACCORDINGLY, I WILL FIRST
DEVOTE A FEW REMARKS TO THE DOMESTIC SITUATION HERE.
4. 1977 HAS JUST PASSED. 1976 WAS NOT AN ORDINARYP
YEAR AND THERE WERE GREAT CHANGES UNDER THE LEADERSHIP OF CHAIRMAN HUA KUO-FENG THE GANG OF FOUR COUNTER
REVOLUTIONARY CONSPIRATORY CLIQUE WAS SMASHED. WE
WERE ABLE TO AVOID A MAJOR SPLIT. PERHAPS WE
SUCCEEDED IN AVOIDING CIVIL WAR. AFTER THE OVERTHROW OF THE GANG OF FOUR, 1977 WAS A MAJOR TURNING
POINT IN OUR FORTUNES. IN OTHER WORDS, IN 1977
CHINA ENTERED A NEW PERIOD OF GREAT DEVELOPMENT.
5. PRIOR TO THEIR OVERTHROW, THE GANG OF FOUR
CONTROLLED A PORTION OF STATE POWER WHICH THEY EXPLOITED AND CAUSED GREAT DAMAGE TO THE POLITICAL,
IDEOLOGICAL AND ECONOMIC HEALTH OF THE COUNTRY.
6. IN 1976 WE ALSO LOST OUR THREE GREAT LEADERS.
THE PEOPLE AND THE PARTY FELT IMMENSE GRIEF. MAO,
CHOU EN-LAI AND CHU TEH AND THE OTHER OLD LEADERS
LED THE PEOPLE IN THEIR STRUGGLE FOR
INDEPENDENCE AGAINST IMPERIALISM AND BUREAUCRATIC
CAPITALISM TO ESTABLISH A NEW PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC
OF CHINA. THE PRC WAS FOUNDED AFTER OUR LEADERS
HAD LED THE PEOPLE THROUGH MANY DIFFICULTIES AND THE

COUNTRY AAD EXPERIENCED MANY TWISTS AND TURNS AS THE
PEOPLE STRIVED TO BUILD SOCIALSIM. DURING THE
DIFFICULT PERIOD AFTER THE PASSING OF OUR THREE
GREAT LEADERS, THE GANG OF FOUR ENGAGED IN A FRENZIED EFFORT TO USURP POWER. OUR NEWSPAPERS HAVE
ALREADY CARRIED MUCH INFORMATION ON THIS AND PERHAPS
THERE IS NO NEED TO GO INTO IT. DURING THE PERIOD
OF THE GREAT PROLETARIAN CULTURAL REVOLUTION, THE
GANG OF FOUR AND LIN PAIO ENGAGED IN DESTRUCTIVE
ACTIVITIES. AT THAT TIME WE SAW THE EVIL DOINGS
OF LIN PIAO AND THE GANG OF FOUR JUST AS INDIVIDUAL
MISTAKES AND DEVIATIONS. OVER A LONG PERIOD
HOWEVER, CHAIRMAN MAO LED THE PARTY AGAINST LIN
PIAO. AFTERWARDS HE LED THE PARTY AGAINST THE GANG
OF FOUR AND SYSTEMATICALLY CRITICIZED THE.
7. CHAIRMAN MAO PROVIDED US WITH THE THREE GREAT
PRINCIPLES AGAINST SPLITTISM AND CHARGED THE GANG OF
FOUR WITH VIOLATING THESE PRINCIPLES. HE CRITICIZED
THE GANG OF FOUR AT MEETINGS OF THE POLITBURO AND
POINTED OUT THAT CHIANG CHING HAD WILD AMBITIONS.
SHE WANTED WANG HUNG-WEN TO BECOME CHAIRMAN OF THE

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
COUNTRY AND SHE HERSELF TO BECOME CHAIRMAN OF THE
PARTY. CHAIRMAN MAO WARNED US OF THIS.
8. CHOU EN-LAI WAS ALSO A VICTIM OF ATTACKS BY THE
GANG OF FOUR. THEY ATTEMPTED TOSUPPLANT HIM AND
TO FORM THEIR OWN CABINET. CHAIRMAN MAO, HOWEVER,
EXPRESSED A DETERMINATION TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM OF
THE GANG OF FOUR IF NOT DURING THAT YEAR, THEN IN
THE NEXT. HE ARRANGED TO BAR THE GANG OF FOUR IN
THEIR EFFORTS TO USURP SUPREME POWER OVER THE
PARTY AND THE STATE. WHEN CHOU WAS CRITICALY ILL
CHAIRMAN MAO APPOINTED TENG HSIAO-PINT TO PRESIDE
OVER THE DAY TO DAY WORK OF THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE,

CENTRAL COMMITTEE AND THE MAN IN CHARGE OF THE DAY
TO DAY OPERATIONS OF THE STATE COUNCIL AND THE
CENTRAL COMMITTEE. HE TOLD HUA KUO-FENG THAT WITH
HUA IN CHARGE HE WAS AT EASE.
9. CHARMAN MAO MADE CLEAR HIS INTENTION TO CHOOSE
HUA AS HIS SUCCESSOR. HE WAS DETERMINED NOT TO LET
THE GANG OF FOUR GET CONTROL OVER THE LEADERSHIP.
IN THIS SITUATION, THE GANG OF FOUR HAD NO WAY OUT
BUT TO RESORT TO SCHEMING AND PLOTTING. THEY
ATTEMPTED TO DESTROY MARXISM-LENINISM AND THE
THOUGHTS OF CHAIRMAN MAO, CREATE CONFUSION AND
TOPPLE DOWN THE LEADERSHIP FROM THE CENTER DOWN TO
THE LOCAL LEVEL. WHEN CHAIRMAN MAO WAS ILL AND PARTICULARLY AFTER HE DIED, THEIR EFFORTS BECAME EVEN MORE
FRENZIED. THEY TRIED TO CREATE THE IMPRESSION THAT
ALL VETERAN CADRES WERE DEMOCRATS (SIC). THEY
FOUND IT DIFFICULT TO CREATE A FOOTHOLD IN THE
MILITARY AND THUS THEY ATTEMPTED TO MAKE A SECOND
MILITARY FORCE OUT OF THE MILITIA. THEY EVEN DISTRIBUTED
GUNS AND AMMUNITION TO THE MILITIA FOR THE PREPARATIONS OF A COUP
D'ETAT. THE SITUATION WAS VERY TENSE AFTER CHAIRMAN
MAO DIED. THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE LED BY HUA KUO-FENG DECIDED
TO ARREST THE GANG OF FOUR WHO WERE IN A MINORITY
IN THE POLITBURO AND WERE AN EVEN SMALLER FORCE IN THE
CENTRAL COMMITTEE ITSELF.

FROM THE PEOPLE. WE SAY THAT THE SMASHING OF THE GANG
OF FOUR WAS A GREAT VICTORY, A VICTORY ACHIEVED
WITHOUT A DROP OF BLOODSHED OR A SHOT FIRED.
MILLIONS OF PEOPLE CELEBRATED, EVEN IN SHANGHAI
WHICH HAD BEEN A CENTER OF THE GANG OF FOUR'S
ACTIVITIES. THERE WERE TWO RASONS WHY WE ACHIEVED
VICTORY OVER THE GANG OF FOUR. FIRST, THE EFFORTS
OF CHAIRMAN MAO HIMSELF. SECOND, THE FACT THAT THE
PEOPLE,ARMY AND PARTY, HAD BEEN TEMEPERED IN STRUGGLE
SUCH AS THE GREAT PROLETARIAN CULTURAL REVOLUTION.
SO THAT THEY HAVE HIGH POLITICAL CONSCIOUSNESS.

APART FROM THE POLITICAL FIELD THERE HAS BEEN
CONSIDERABLE DEVELOPMENT ECONOMICALLY TOO. CHINA,
HOWEVER, IS STILL DEVELOPING AND IS STILL VERY BACKWARD. OWING TO THE SABOTAGE OF THE GANG OF FOUR
WE HAVE UNDERGONE A LONG PERIOD OF STAGNATION,

12. NOW, PERHAPS, YOU WOULD LIKETO ASK SOME QUESTIONS.
13. CONGRESSMAN WHALEN: YOUR COUNTRY HAS CONSIDERABLE EXPERIENCE IN AFRICA. THE TANZAM RAILWAY IS A
GREAT EXAMPLE OF WHAT ONE COUNTRY CAN DO FOR
ANOTHER. IN CONNECTION WITH DEVELOPMENTS IN AFRICA
GENERALLY, I WONDER HOW YOUR DELEGATION VOTED ON THE
FOUR RECENT UNITED NATIONS SECURITY COUNCIL DRAFT RESOLUTIONS
DEALING WITH SOUTHERNAFRICA. I AM ALSO INTERESTED
IN THE POSITION YOUR GOVERNMENT MIGHT TAKE SHOULD
THE SECURITY COUNCIL PASS A RESOLUTION ON ECONOMIC
SANCTIONS AGAINST SOUTH AFRICA. FINALLY, I WAS
CURIOUS AS TO WHETHER CHINA MIGHT SUPPORT THE
BRITISH AND AMERICAN INITIATIVE ON RHODESIA.
14. HUANG: AFRICA HAS BEEN A VERY TROUBLED AREA
IN 1977. BESIDES BEING ENGAGED IN MANY ACTIVITIES
IN THE MIDDLE EAST AND THE MEDITERRANANEN THE
SOVIET UNION IS ALSO INVOLVED IN MANY OFFENSIVE
ACTIVITIES IN AFRICA. SOVIET ACTIVITY IS PART
OF A WORLDWIDE HEGEMONISTIC PLAN. AFTER THEIR
TEMPORARY SUCCESS IN ANGOLA, THE SOVIET UNION
INTENDS TO USE THAT COUNTRY AS A BASE FOR ITS
MERCENARY FORCES' INVASION OF ZAIRE AND TO STICK
THEIR HANDS INTO THE ZIMBABWE SITUATION AS PART OF
THEIR PLAN FOR WORLD HEGEMONY. THE SOVIET UNION
WANTS TO CONTROL ROUTES INTO THE INDIAN OCEAN AND THE
SOUTHERN ATLANTIC. THIS IS PART OF THEIR PLAN OF
DEPLOYMENT FOR THE FINAL BATTLE FOR WORLD HEGEMONY.

ARE ATTEMPTING TO CONTROL EHTIOPIA AND SOMALIA.
THEY HAVE GRANTED MILITARY ASSISTANCE IN AN ATTEMPT
TO CONTROL ETHIOPIA AND ALSO WISH TO COME BACK TO

STRATEGY IN THE MIDDLE EAST IS TO CONTROL THE FLOW

THEY WILL BE ABLE TO SUFFOCATE WESTERN EUROPE AND
BRING THE EUROPEANS TO THEIR KNEES WITHOUT WAR. THE
SOVIET UNION HARBORS WILD AMBITIONS.

15. THE FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEM IS HOW TO SUPPORT THE
JUST DEMANDS OF THE AFRICANS AND PALESTINIAN
PEOPLE AGAINST HEGEMONISM. OUR APPROACH DIFFERS
FROM THAT OF THE US. THE US PAYS EXCESSIVE ATTENTION
TO THE MILITARYASPECTS OF THE PROBLEM. YOU WANT TO
USE SOUTH AFRICAN AND RHODESIAN MILITARY FORCES TO
COUNTER THE SOVIET UNION. IN THE MIDDLE EAST YOU
DEPEND EXCESSIVELY ON ISRAELI MILITARY
FORCE TO COUNTER THAT OF THE ARABS AND THE SOVIET
UNION. HOWEVER, SMITH AND VORSTER IN SOUTH AFRICA
ARE A NET MINUS FOR THE US. ISRAEL'S OBDURATE AND
IRRATIONAL POLICIES ARE ALSO NET MINUSES FOR THE US
IN THE MIDDLE EAST. WE HOPE THAT IF THE US AS WELL
AS ITS ALLIES WERE TO RESULUTELY SUPPORT THE JUST
DEMANDS OF THE AFRICANS AND ARABS IT MIGHT BE
POSSIBLE TO MAINTAIN THE US POSITIONIN THE AREAS

US SUPPORT FOR A RECALCITRANT ZIONIST REGIME WHICH

MANY COUNTRIES HAVE RAISED THE DEMAND THAT THE SECURITY
COUNCIL ADOPT MILITARY AND ECONOMIC SANCTIONS
AGAINST SOUTH AFRICA. THESE JUST DEMANDS SHOULD BE
SUPPORTED.
17. IT IS DIFFICULT TO SAY WHETHER THE US AND BRITISH
PROPOSAL FOR RHODESIA IS ACHIEVING ANY SUCCESS. THE
SOVIET UNION HAS INTERFERED IN THE LIBERATION STRUGGLE
ON A LARGE SACLE. THE US INTENDS TO PRECLUDE SOVIET
INTERFERENCE BUT THERE AARE DIFFICULTIES. POSSIBLY
THE US AND BRITISH PLAN CANNOT TAKE EFFECT FOR A

19. MATHIAS: PERHAPS THE FOREIGN MINISTER MIGHT
COMMENT ON THE RECENT SOVIET-US JOINT STATEMENT ON
THE MIDDLE EAST.
20. HUANG: I ASSUME BEFOREHAND THAT YOU ARE ALL
CLEAR ON CHINESE POSITION WITH REGARD TO ISSUES IN
THE MIDDLE EAST. WE HAVE SUGGESTED TO THE US THAT
IT ADOPT A POLICY OF USING TWO HANDS. ONE HAND SHOULD
SUPPORT THE EXISTENCE OF IRAEL. THE OTHER SHOULD
BE EXTENDED TOWARDS THE ARABS TO MAKE THEM
RESIST THE SOVIET UNION. WITH REGARD TO THE QUESTION

WISE OR NOT. THE GENEVA CONFERENCE SEEMS TO BE
DRIFTING FURTHERAND FURTHER AWAY.
21. WHALEN: THE US GOVERNMENT SHARES THE HOPES
AND ASPIRATIONS OF THE MAJORITIES OF PEOPLE IN
AFRICA. THIS MEANS THAT THE US PREFERS PEACEFUL
MEANS TO RESOLVE AFRICA'S PROBLEMS. WITH REGARD
TO THE SOMALIA-ETHIOPIA STRUGGLE, IT IS OUR UNDERSTANDING THAT THE SOMALIS ACTUALLY STARTED THE FIGHTING
AND THAT THE SOVIET UNION HAS LARGELY CONTRIBUTED TO

C O N F I D E N T I A L SECTION 3 OF 3 PEKING 0066
A DEFENSIVE OPERATION.
22. HUANG: THE ROOT SOURCE IS RIVALRY BETWEEN THE
TWO SUPERPOWERS. FIRST, THE SOVIET UNION WANTED TO
CONTROL SOMALIA AND MAINTAIN BASES THERE. THEN THEY
CAPITALIZED ON THE SITUATION EXISTING BETWEEN THE
TWO COUNTRIES.
23. RICHMOND. WE HAVE JUST TALKED TO AMBASSADOR
HAO ON THE ISSUE OF NORMALIZATION OF RELATIONS BETWEEN THE US AND THE PRC. ARE THERE OTHER AREAS
BESIDES THE TAIWAN ISSUE IN WHICH OUR RELATIONS
MIGHT BE NORMALIZE? IN OTHER WORDS, COULD THERE
BE EXPANDED CONTACTS IN TRADE, INDUSTRY, AGRICULTURE,
AND CULTURAL EXCHANGES?
24. HUANG: THE CRUCIAL POINT IN NORMLAIZATION IS
THE TAIWAN PROBLEM. THERE IS NO WAY TO AVOID THIS.
SINCE PRESIDENT NIXON IN 1972 VISITED CHINA AND SIGNED
THE SHANGHAI COMMUNIQUE OUR RELATIONS HAVE DEVELOPED
STEADILY AND THAT IS A GOOD DEVELOPMENT. ACTUALLY
NIXON THEN VISUALIZEED THE NORMALIZATION OF RELATIONS
IN THE MIDDLE OF HIS SECOND TERM BUT THERE EMERGED
CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL
PAGE 02

PEKING 00066 03 OF 03 070952Z

CERTAIN POLITICAL PROBLEMS WHICH LED TO THE POSTPONING OF NORMALIZATION. THE POSITION TAKEN BY CHINA
IS THAT TAIWAN IS PART OF CHINA AND THAT THE RETURN
OF TAIWAN IS AN INTEGRAL PART OF THE UNIFICATION OF
THE WHOLE COUNTRY. ALL THE PEOPLE IN CHINA ARE
FAMILIAR WITH THE SLOGAN THAT WE ARE DETERMINED TO
LIBERATE TAIWAN. IT IS A PROMISE BY THE PARTY AND
GOVERNMENT TO THE PEOPLE. HOW THIS IS DONE AND
WHEN IS NOT A SUBJECT TO BE INCLUDED IN NEGOTIATIONS
WITH FOREIGN COUNTRIES. WE HAVE MADE CLEAR OUR
VIEWS ON THIS POINT TO OUR AMERICAN FRIENDS. WE
HAVE INFORMED YOU OF THE THREE PRINCIPLES FOR THE
RESOLUTION OF THE TAIWAN PROBLEM. THE US, HOWEVER,
HAS NOT MADE UP ITS MIND. WE CAN WAIT, BUT NOT
INDEFINITELY. OUR AMERICAN FRIENDS HAVE PUT FORWARD
A STRING OF PROPOSALS. THE CENTRAL PART OF THESE
PROPOSALS IS THE IDEA THAT THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT
IS NOT TO USE FORCE. FRANKLY THIS CONSITUTES
INTERFERENCE IN CHINA'S INTERNAL AFFAIRS AND IS A
TWO CHINAS CONCEPT WHICH WE CANNOT ACCEPT.
25. MEANWHILE OTHER ASPECTS OF OUR RELATIONSHIP

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
CAN CONTINUE TO DEVELOP ACCORDING TO THE SHANGHAI
COMMUNIQUE. THESE INCLUDE CULTURAL EXCHANGES AND
TRADE. BUT IN THE ABSENCE OF NORMAL RELATIONS,
DEVELOPMENTS IN ALL THESE FIELDSS HAVE THEIR LIMITS.
I RECALL WHEN THE COMMITTEE FOR THE PRESENT
DANGER WAS HERE WE DISCUSSED FOREIGN TRADE AND THE
SALE OF A CERTAIN COMPUTER WHICH MR. PACKARD SAID
THE STATE DEPARTMENT HAD NOT GRANTED PRMISSION FOR
EXPORT. THE US PERHAPS STILL REGARDS CHINA AS AN
ADVERSARY AND PUTS CHINA IN THE SAME POSITION AS THE
SOVIET UNION. YOU TRY TO STRIKKE A BALANCE BETWEEN
CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL
PAGE 03

PEKING 00066 03 OF 03 070952Z

THE SOVIET UNION ANDCHINA.
26. THE PROBLEM OF ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT IN CHINA WAS
DISCUSSED AT THE 11TH CENTRAL COMMITTEE MEETING AND
THE 5TH NATIONAL PEOPLE'S CONGRESS WILL NO DOUBT
REITARATE THAT WE ARE RESOLVED TO REALIZE THE
&quot;FOUR MODERNIZATIONS&quot; BY THE YEAR 2000. WE ARE
WILLING TO ENTER INTO COOPERATION WITH FOREIGN
COUNTRIES BUT OUR FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLE REMAINS
SELF-RELIANCE. WE DO NOT REST OUR PLANS FOR ACHIEVING
THE FOUR MODERNIZATIONS ON THE BAASIS OF THE IMPORTATION OF WHOLE PLANTS OR TECHNOLOGY FROM FOREIGN
COUNTRIES. I SUGGEST THAT YOU MIGHT GO INTO MORE
DETAIL ON THIS POINT WITH MINISTER OF FOREIGN TRADE
LI CHIANG.
27. HART: I HAVETWO POINTS. FIRST, THE US CONGRESS IS NOW PLAYING A GREATER ROLE IN THE FORMULATION OF FOREIGN POLICY. IT MAY BE DIFFICULT FOR
OUR FRIENDS TO UNDERSTAND BUT WE SHOULD MAKE CLEAR
THAT CONGRESSIONAL COMMITTEES CANNOT DICTATE FOREIGN
POLICY BUT ARE GOING TO ASSUME A LARGER ROLE
IN ITS FORMULATION. SECONDLY, OUR NEGOTIATIONS WITH
THE SOVIET UNION ON THE LIMITATION OF STRATEGIC
ARMS HAVE BEEN INTERPRETED BY OUR GOVERNMENT
AND OTHERS AS DEMONSTRATING WEAKNESS AND MISUNDERSTANDING
OF THE SOVIET THREAT. BOTH THE AMINISTRATION AND
CONGRESS REALIZE THAT THE SOVIET UNION MIGHT NOT
LIVE UP TO ITS GREEMENTS. AND WE KNOW THAT WE
SHOULD NOT LET DOWN OUR GUARD WITH RESPECT TO
CONVENTIONAL WARFARE. EVEN IF WE DO ACHIEVE A SALT
AAGREEMENT WE STILL HAVE OBLIGATIONS TO OUR FRIENDS
AROUND THE WORLD AN PARTICULARLY THOSE OF WESTERN
EUROPE.

ON YOUR REMARKS. THE SOVIETS AND THE US ARE ENGAGED
IN A RIVALRY FOR HEGEMONY. THIS IS AN OBJECTIVE
FACT. SECRETARY VANCE HIMSELF HAS SAID THAT
COMPETITION BETWEEN THE US AND THE SOVIET UNION IS
AN OBJECTIVE FACT. WE SAY THAT THIS IS A CONTRADICTION WHICH IS IRRECONCILABLE. DESPITE NEGOTIATIONS
BOTH ARE NOW PREPARING FOR WAR. PAST EXPERIENCE HAS
SHOWN THAT NEGOTIATIONS ARE UNABLE TO PREVENT CMPETITION IN ACCUMULATING ARMS. YOU HAVE BEEN UNABLE
TO CHECK THE MOMENTUM IN THE SOVIET BUILDUP. THE
US HAS IMPORTANT INTERESTS TO PROTECT AND THE
SOVIETS WANT TO EXPAND. THE RIVALRY IS BOUND TO LEAD
TO WAR. YOU MIGHT THINK THAT IS AVOIDABLE. WE
DIVERGE FROM THIS VIEW. THIRTY-TWO YEARS HAVE ALREADY
PASSED SINCE WORLD WAR II. WE DO NOT BELIEVE IN
LASTING PEACE. IN OUR VIEW WAR WILL BREAK OUT SOONER
OR LATER. THIS WILL NOT BE THROUGH ANY DESIRE
OF THE THIRD WORLD NOR THE SECOND WORLD. THESE
COUNTRIES DO NOT HAVE THE STRENGTH AND NEED A PEACEFUL ENVIRONMENT TO BUILD UPTHEIR ECONOMIES. WE
HOPE PEACE CAN CONTINUE AS LONG AS POSSIBLE BUT MUST
BE VIGILANT IN OUR PREPARATIONS FOR WAR. WE TELL
OUR PEOPLE IF WAR SHOULD BREAK OUT WE WILL PREPARE
FOR IT. SHOULD IT COME EITHER EARLY OR LATE OR
BY NUCLEAR OR CONVENTIONAL. I DO NOT MEAN THAT
CHINA IS BELLICOSE BUT THAT WE MUST PREPARE FOR A
WAR THAT MIGHT BE IMPOSED ON US. WE HAVE NEITHER
SOLDIERS NOR BASES ABROAD. WE HAVE NO INTENTION TO
BECOME A SUPERPOWER. THIS IS WRITTEN INTO OUR
PARTY'S RESLUTIONS AND INTO OUR CONSTITUTION. WITH
REGARD TO YOU SECOND POINT. WE MUST RESOLUTELY
STRUGGLE AGAINST AGGRESSION. THE SOVIET UNION IS
ON THE OFFENSIVE, THE US ON THE DEFENSIVE. THEY ARE

CONSTANTLY TESTING YOUR RESOLVE. THE SOVIET UNION
IS A FASCIST ECONOMY BASED ON STATE CAPITALISM.
IT HAS A WILD URGE FOR WORLD HEGEMONY WHICH CAUSES
IT TO MAKE ENORMOUS WAR PREPARATIONS. IT WOULD BE
EASY FOR THE SOVIETS TO GO TO WAR. ON THE OTHER
HAND YOUHAVE TO GO THROUGH VARIOUS CONSTITUTIONAL
PROCEDURES. ALTHOUGH WE ARE OPPOSED TO THE RIVALRY
BETWEEN THE SUPERPOWERS, WE BELIEVE THAT THE SOVIETS
ARE THE MOST DANGEROUS AND ARE THE CHIEF ENEMY
OF THE PEOPLE OF THE WORLD. NEGOTIATIONSSHOULD BE

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
AIMED AT THE ENEMY AND NOT AT YOURSELF. THIS KIND
OF NEGOTIATIONS SHOULD LEAVE NO ILLUSIONS BEHIND.
29. AFTER THE MEETING BROKE UP FOREIGN MINISTER
HUANG STATED, &quot;I WOULDLIKE MY FRIENDS TO CONVEY THE
MESSAGE TO THE CONGRESS THAT RELATIONS BETWEEN CHINA
AND THE UNITED STATES ARE A POLITICAL AND NOT A
DIPLOMATIC MATTER. I HOPETHAT THE US WILL CONSIDER
THIS RELATIONSHIP FROM A POINT OF VIEW OF ITS
LONG TERM STRATEGIC INTERESTS.&quot;
