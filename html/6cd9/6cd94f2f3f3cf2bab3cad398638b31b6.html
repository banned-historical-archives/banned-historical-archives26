		<h3>Tor</h3>
		<p><a href="https://www.torproject.org">Tor</a> is an encrypted anonymising network that makes it harder to intercept internet communications, or see where communications are coming from or going to.</p>
		<p>In order to use the WikiLeaks public submission system as detailed above you can download the Tor Browser Bundle, which is a Firefox-like browser available for Windows, Mac OS X and GNU/Linux and pre-configured to connect using the anonymising system Tor.</p>
		<h4>Tails</h4>
		<p>If you are at high risk and you have the capacity to do so, you can also access the submission system through a secure operating system called <a href="https://tails.boum.org">Tails</a>. Tails is an operating system launched from a USB stick or a DVD that aim to leaves no traces when the computer is shut down after use and automatically routes your internet traffic through Tor. Tails will require you to have either a USB stick or a DVD at least 4GB big and a laptop or desktop computer.</p>

		<h3>Tips</h3>
		<p>Our submission system works hard to preserve your anonymity, but we recommend you also take some of your own precautions. Please review these basic guidelines. </p>
		<div>
			<h4>1. Contact us if you have specific problems</h4>
			<p>If you have a very large submission, or a submission with a complex format, or are a high-risk source, please <a href="#submit_help_contact">contact us</a>. In our experience it is always possible to find a custom solution for even the most seemingly difficult situations.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h4>2. What computer to use</h4>
			<p>If the computer you are uploading from could subsequently be audited in an investigation, consider using a computer that is not easily tied to you. Technical users can also use <a href="https://tails.boum.org">Tails</a> to help ensure you do not leave any records of your submission on the computer.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h4>3. Do not talk about your submission to others</h4>
			<p>If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in source protection – it is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This includes other media organisations.</p>
		</div>

	</div>

		<h3>After</h3>

		<div>
			<h4>1. Do not talk about your submission to others</h4>
			<p>If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in source protection – it is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This includes other media organisations.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h4>2. Act normal</h4>
			<p>If you are a high-risk source, avoid saying anything or doing anything after submitting which might promote suspicion. In particular, you should try to stick to your normal routine and behaviour.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h4>3. Remove traces of your submission</h4>
			<p>If you are a high-risk source and the computer you prepared your submission on, or uploaded it from, could subsequently be audited in an investigation, we recommend that you format and dispose of the computer hard drive and any other storage media you used.</p>
			<p>In particular, hard drives retain data after formatting which may be visible to a digital forensics team and flash media (USB sticks, memory cards and SSD drives) retain data even after a secure erasure. If you used flash media to store sensitive data, it is important to destroy the media.</p>
			<p>If you do this and are a high-risk source you should make sure there are no traces of the clean-up, since such traces themselves may draw suspicion.</p>
			<div>
				<h4>4. If you face legal action</h4>
				<p>If a legal action is brought against you as a result of your submission, there are organisations that may help you. The Courage Foundation is an international organisation dedicated to the protection of journalistic sources. You can find more details at <a href="https://www.couragefound.org">https://www.couragefound.org</a>.</p>

		<p>WikiLeaks publishes documents of political or historical importance that are censored or otherwise suppressed. We specialise in strategic global publishing and large archives.</p>
		<p>The following is the address of our secure site where you can anonymously upload your documents to WikiLeaks editors. You can only access this submissions system through Tor. (See our <a href="#submit_help_tor">Tor tab</a> for more information.) We also advise you to read our <a href="#submit_help_tips">tips for sources</a> before submitting.</p>

			<!--<div>
				Copy this address into your Tor browser. Advanced users, if they wish, can also add a further layer of encryption to their submission using <a href="#submit_wlkey">our public PGP key</a>.
			</div>-->
		</div>

		<p>If you cannot use Tor, or your submission is very large, or you have specific requirements, WikiLeaks provides several alternative methods. <a href="#submit_help_contact">Contact us</a> to discuss how to proceed.</p>

NEGOTS--MEANING ACKNOWLEDGEMENT BY TAIWAN THAT CHINA
HAS BEEN AT LEAST TECHNICALLY &quot;REUNIFIED&quot;; TAIWAN COULD
NOT CLAIM TO BE INDEPENDENT ROC OR RIGHTFUL GOVT OF ALL
CHINA EVEN IF DENG'S OFFER HAS NO OTHER HIDDEN CONDITIONS,
IT WOULD REQUIRE CCK GOVT CONSIDER SOME PAINFUL STEPS.
NYT SUGGESTS THAT IN SHORT RUN, TAIWAN LOOKS SAFE IN
SPURNING DENG'S PROPOSAL; BUT IF OVER TIME TAIPEI FAILS
ENTER INTO NEGOTS WITH PEKING, ITS PRESENT SAFETY MAY
DISAPPEAR; FEELS DENG'S CAREFUL WARNING -- THAT FAILURE
NEGOTIATE MAY FORCE PEKING RESORT TO FORCE -- IS THREAT/
PREDICTION IN EQUAL MEASURE. THINKS DENG HAS POINTED
WAY WITHOUT BREACHING ASSUMPTIONS ON WHICH PRES CARTER
RECOGNIZED PEKING--BUT TAIWAN MUST CONCLUDE ONE DAY THAT
IT PREFERS NEGOTIATE SEPARATE IDENTITY RATHER THAN HAVE
FIGHT FOR IT ON ANOTHER DAY.

CAN EXPLORE THEIR RELS BEST BY FUNCTIONAL EXPERIMENTS

TAIWAN PREMIER YS SUN TO RESPOND. SUGGESTS PRC/TAIWAN
CAN EXPLORE THEIR RELS BEST BY FUNCTIONAL EXPERIMENTS
WITHOUT TALKING ABOUT REUNIFICATION--WHAT THEY NEED ARE
CULTURAL EXCHANGES/FAMILY UNIFICATIONS/FREE TRAVEL IN
BOTH DIRECTIONS/POSTAL AND TRADE LINKS/FREE INFO EXCHANGES. DOUBTS TAIWAN HAS COURAGE FOR ALL THIS AT ONCE/
OR THAT PEKING WOULE RISK GREATER FERMENT.
BUT SUN ASSERTS PERHAPS EACH SIDE COULD RISK SMALL BEGINNINGS; UNIFICATION DEMANDS ARE SELF-DEFEATING, THEIR
REITERATION COULD HAVE CHIEF EFFECT OF PREVENTING CO-OP
PROGRESS IN THAT DIRECTION. HOWEVER, CONCLUDES DENG IS
NOT REALLY WOOING TAIWAN YET--HE IS REALLY PREPARING FOR
US VISIT, AND DOING SMOOTH JOB OF IT SO FAR.
PROF RN WELLS (ST LAWRENDE U, CANTON NY) WRITES NYT (1/14

ABROGATION OF TAIWAN DEFENSE TREATY--WHICH IS PRINCIPALLY
POL QUESTION. HOLDS THAT COURTS CANNOT REVERSE DIPLO
RECOGNITION OF PRC/NOR WILL THEY COMPEL PRES HONOR
TREATY; IF COURT RULES FOR CARTER OR DISMISSES SUIT--&quot;2
VERY PROBABLE OUTCOMES&quot;--THEN CONGRESS COMES UP LOSER
AGAIN.
ACCORDING WELLS, MORE APPROPRIATE ACTION WOULD HAVE BEEN
INTRODUCTION OF SENATE RESOLUTION, OR IN BOTH HOUSES, EXPRESSING DISAPPROVAL OF PRES' ACTIONS IN TERMINATING DIPLO
RELS/DEFENSE TREATY WITH TAIWAN.

SAYS THIS RELATIONSHIP SEEMS FALL EASILY WITHIN PEKING'S
CONCEPT OF &quot;MUTUAL BENEFIT,&quot; AND NO ONE IN CHINA BREATHES
WORD OF &quot;LIBERATING&quot; ENTIRELY DEFENSELESS HK. DECLARES
TAIWAN MIGHT BECOME EVEN LARGER/MORE VITAL HK. MAINTAINS
THIS NO PIPE DREAM, IF ONE JUDGES ACTIONS/WORDS OF PRC
AUTHORITIES BEFORE/AFTER NORMALIZATION WITH US; OR IF ONE
JUDGES BY ILLICIT TRADE THAT HAS ALREADY BEEN SEEPING BETWEEN ISLAND/MAINLAND FOR DECADES.

BUT WINTER WEATHER RULED OUT LOOK AT WHEAT/CORN FARMS.

US OFFICIALS FEARED HOSTILE RECEPTION FROM TAIWAN SUPPORTERS; BUT SEATTLE HAS BECOME INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT GATEWAY TO EASIA/CENTER OF AEROSPACE INDUSTRY THAT PRODUCED
