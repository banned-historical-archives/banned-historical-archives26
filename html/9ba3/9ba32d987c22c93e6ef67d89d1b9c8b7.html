		<h3>Tor</h3>
		<p><a href="https://www.torproject.org">Tor</a> is an encrypted anonymising network that makes it harder to intercept internet communications, or see where communications are coming from or going to.</p>
		<p>In order to use the WikiLeaks public submission system as detailed above you can download the Tor Browser Bundle, which is a Firefox-like browser available for Windows, Mac OS X and GNU/Linux and pre-configured to connect using the anonymising system Tor.</p>
		<h4>Tails</h4>
		<p>If you are at high risk and you have the capacity to do so, you can also access the submission system through a secure operating system called <a href="https://tails.boum.org">Tails</a>. Tails is an operating system launched from a USB stick or a DVD that aim to leaves no traces when the computer is shut down after use and automatically routes your internet traffic through Tor. Tails will require you to have either a USB stick or a DVD at least 4GB big and a laptop or desktop computer.</p>

		<h3>Tips</h3>
		<p>Our submission system works hard to preserve your anonymity, but we recommend you also take some of your own precautions. Please review these basic guidelines. </p>
		<div>
			<h4>1. Contact us if you have specific problems</h4>
			<p>If you have a very large submission, or a submission with a complex format, or are a high-risk source, please <a href="#submit_help_contact">contact us</a>. In our experience it is always possible to find a custom solution for even the most seemingly difficult situations.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h4>2. What computer to use</h4>
			<p>If the computer you are uploading from could subsequently be audited in an investigation, consider using a computer that is not easily tied to you. Technical users can also use <a href="https://tails.boum.org">Tails</a> to help ensure you do not leave any records of your submission on the computer.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h4>3. Do not talk about your submission to others</h4>
			<p>If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in source protection – it is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This includes other media organisations.</p>
		</div>

	</div>

		<h3>After</h3>

		<div>
			<h4>1. Do not talk about your submission to others</h4>
			<p>If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in source protection – it is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This includes other media organisations.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h4>2. Act normal</h4>
			<p>If you are a high-risk source, avoid saying anything or doing anything after submitting which might promote suspicion. In particular, you should try to stick to your normal routine and behaviour.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h4>3. Remove traces of your submission</h4>
			<p>If you are a high-risk source and the computer you prepared your submission on, or uploaded it from, could subsequently be audited in an investigation, we recommend that you format and dispose of the computer hard drive and any other storage media you used.</p>
			<p>In particular, hard drives retain data after formatting which may be visible to a digital forensics team and flash media (USB sticks, memory cards and SSD drives) retain data even after a secure erasure. If you used flash media to store sensitive data, it is important to destroy the media.</p>
			<p>If you do this and are a high-risk source you should make sure there are no traces of the clean-up, since such traces themselves may draw suspicion.</p>
			<div>
				<h4>4. If you face legal action</h4>
				<p>If a legal action is brought against you as a result of your submission, there are organisations that may help you. The Courage Foundation is an international organisation dedicated to the protection of journalistic sources. You can find more details at <a href="https://www.couragefound.org">https://www.couragefound.org</a>.</p>

		<p>WikiLeaks publishes documents of political or historical importance that are censored or otherwise suppressed. We specialise in strategic global publishing and large archives.</p>
		<p>The following is the address of our secure site where you can anonymously upload your documents to WikiLeaks editors. You can only access this submissions system through Tor. (See our <a href="#submit_help_tor">Tor tab</a> for more information.) We also advise you to read our <a href="#submit_help_tips">tips for sources</a> before submitting.</p>

			<!--<div>
				Copy this address into your Tor browser. Advanced users, if they wish, can also add a further layer of encryption to their submission using <a href="#submit_wlkey">our public PGP key</a>.
			</div>-->
		</div>

		<p>If you cannot use Tor, or your submission is very large, or you have specific requirements, WikiLeaks provides several alternative methods. <a href="#submit_help_contact">Contact us</a> to discuss how to proceed.</p>

15.  KOREA

WSJ'S PEARLSTINE, AT &quot;HILL 229,&quot; SK, WRITES OF GEN
HOLLINGSWORTH, COMMANDER OF 183,000-MAN US-UK I CORPS
GROUP, RESPONSIBLE FOR DEFENDING CENTRAL PART OF DMZ
AND 6.5 MILLION IN SEOUL AGAINST ANY NK ATTACK.  GEN SAYS
IF REDS ATTACK, &quot;THEY HAVE TO BRING THEIR TANKS THROUGH
HERE.  AND WHEN  THEY DO, I AM GOING TO MURDER THEM.&quot;
PEARLSTINE NOTES &quot;HOLLY&quot; IS &quot;ONE OF THOSE GENERALS WHO
IS TOTALLY COMMITTED TO MAYHEM,&quot; ACCORDING SENIOR SFRC
STAFFER, AND HIS WORDS SHOULD BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY.
RECOGNIZING VN ENDED US APPETITE FOR LONG ASIAN GROUND
WARMS.  HOLLINGSWORTH SAYS HE HAS PREPARED FOR &quot;SHORT,
VIOLENT WAR&quot;; WOULD SEEK END IT WITHIN 9 DAYS, RELYING
ON HEAVY ARTILLERY, MASSIVE AIR SUPPORT, INCLUDING
B-52 BOMBERS NOW ON GUAM.

PEARLSTINE OBSERVES WHILE GEN CONVINCED HIS SHORT-WAR
PLAN WOULD WORK, THERE ARE OTHERS WHO HOLD SUCH SANGUINE
PROMISES SUSPECT.  CITES ONE US MIL OFFICIAL THAT THERE
ISN'T ENOUGH ARTILLERY IN PLACE TO SUSTAIN VIOLENT CONFLICT
&quot;HOLLY&quot; EVISIONS; AND JAPANESE DEFENSE ANALYSTS THINK
WOULD BE AT LEAST SEVERAL MONTHS BEFORE SK, US TROOPS,
COULD END WAR WITH NK.  COMMENTS THAT IF SO&quot; PRESSURE
MIGHT BUILD ON PRC AND SOVIET TO ENTER FRAY AND ON US TO

INCREASE TROOP COMMITMENTS; ULTIMATELY, US MIGHT ALSO FEEL
COMPELLED USE NUKES.  NOTES GEN'S IMAGE AS &quot;HIP SHOOTER,&quot;
EARNED IN VN FIGHTING, IS OVERDRAWN, ACCORDING HIS
DEFENDERS, INCLUDING SOME TOP OFFICIALS AMEMBASSY SEOUL;
THEY ASSERT HIS REPUTATION FOR VIOLENCE MAY NOW SERVE AS
IMPORTANT DETERRENT TO NK AGGRESSION ALONG DMZ.  EMBASSY
OFFICIAL WHO KNOWS HIM WELL SAYS DESPITE &quot;WILD&quot; IMAGE,
'HOLLY&quot; FOLLOWS ORDERS, EASIER TO WORK WITH THAN OTHER,
LESS FLAMBOYANT US MIL BRASS IN SK.  ONE US  MIL
OFFICIAL IN SK SAYS HOLLINGSWORTH IS ONLY GENERAL IN

PAGE 11  STATE  008239

WORLD WHO TELLS ENEMY EXACTLY WHAT HIS PLANS ARE, AND
HAS PROBABLY KEPT NK FROM MISCALCULATING WHEN EVALUATING
US DEFENSES.

PEARLSTINE NOTES GEN CREDITED WITH IMPROVING PREPAREDNESS,
MORALE OF US, SK FORCES DURING TIME HE HAS HEADED I
CORPS, JUNKING PREDECESSORS' DEFENSE STRATEGY OF RETREAT
IN FACE OF ATTACK, AND REVAMPING TROOPS' TRAINING PROGRAMS.
HIS PRESENCE HAS ENCOURAGED SK MIL LEADERS, SOME OF
WHOM IMPRESSED THAT HE SPENDS SO MUCH TIME ALONG DMZ AND
I CORPS HQS.  HE HAS ALSO TRIED DEVELOP RAPPORT WITH
SK FARMERS, VILLAGERS LIVING NEAR DMZ.  &quot;HOLLY&quot; LAVISH
WITH PRAISE FOR SKOREANS, DOESN'T SHARE CONCERN OF
MANY AMERICANS ABOUT PRES PARK'S AUTHORITARIAN GOVT.
MANY US MIL OFFICIALS IN SK THINK HE COULD HANDLE
STILWELL'S  JOB AS COMMANDING GENERAL ALL TROOPS
IN SK; BUT OTHERS, INCLUDING SOME DOD OFFICIALS, STILL
QUESTION WHETHER HE IS DIPLOMATIC ENOUGH FOR ASSIGNMENT.
