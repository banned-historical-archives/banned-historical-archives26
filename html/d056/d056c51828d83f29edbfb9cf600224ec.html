		<h3>Tor</h3>
		<p><a href="https://www.torproject.org">Tor</a> is an encrypted anonymising network that makes it harder to intercept internet communications, or see where communications are coming from or going to.</p>
		<p>In order to use the WikiLeaks public submission system as detailed above you can download the Tor Browser Bundle, which is a Firefox-like browser available for Windows, Mac OS X and GNU/Linux and pre-configured to connect using the anonymising system Tor.</p>
		<h4>Tails</h4>
		<p>If you are at high risk and you have the capacity to do so, you can also access the submission system through a secure operating system called <a href="https://tails.boum.org">Tails</a>. Tails is an operating system launched from a USB stick or a DVD that aim to leaves no traces when the computer is shut down after use and automatically routes your internet traffic through Tor. Tails will require you to have either a USB stick or a DVD at least 4GB big and a laptop or desktop computer.</p>

		<h3>Tips</h3>
		<p>Our submission system works hard to preserve your anonymity, but we recommend you also take some of your own precautions. Please review these basic guidelines. </p>
		<div>
			<h4>1. Contact us if you have specific problems</h4>
			<p>If you have a very large submission, or a submission with a complex format, or are a high-risk source, please <a href="#submit_help_contact">contact us</a>. In our experience it is always possible to find a custom solution for even the most seemingly difficult situations.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h4>2. What computer to use</h4>
			<p>If the computer you are uploading from could subsequently be audited in an investigation, consider using a computer that is not easily tied to you. Technical users can also use <a href="https://tails.boum.org">Tails</a> to help ensure you do not leave any records of your submission on the computer.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h4>3. Do not talk about your submission to others</h4>
			<p>If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in source protection – it is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This includes other media organisations.</p>
		</div>

	</div>

		<h3>After</h3>

		<div>
			<h4>1. Do not talk about your submission to others</h4>
			<p>If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in source protection – it is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This includes other media organisations.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h4>2. Act normal</h4>
			<p>If you are a high-risk source, avoid saying anything or doing anything after submitting which might promote suspicion. In particular, you should try to stick to your normal routine and behaviour.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h4>3. Remove traces of your submission</h4>
			<p>If you are a high-risk source and the computer you prepared your submission on, or uploaded it from, could subsequently be audited in an investigation, we recommend that you format and dispose of the computer hard drive and any other storage media you used.</p>
			<p>In particular, hard drives retain data after formatting which may be visible to a digital forensics team and flash media (USB sticks, memory cards and SSD drives) retain data even after a secure erasure. If you used flash media to store sensitive data, it is important to destroy the media.</p>
			<p>If you do this and are a high-risk source you should make sure there are no traces of the clean-up, since such traces themselves may draw suspicion.</p>
			<div>
				<h4>4. If you face legal action</h4>
				<p>If a legal action is brought against you as a result of your submission, there are organisations that may help you. The Courage Foundation is an international organisation dedicated to the protection of journalistic sources. You can find more details at <a href="https://www.couragefound.org">https://www.couragefound.org</a>.</p>

		<p>WikiLeaks publishes documents of political or historical importance that are censored or otherwise suppressed. We specialise in strategic global publishing and large archives.</p>
		<p>The following is the address of our secure site where you can anonymously upload your documents to WikiLeaks editors. You can only access this submissions system through Tor. (See our <a href="#submit_help_tor">Tor tab</a> for more information.) We also advise you to read our <a href="#submit_help_tips">tips for sources</a> before submitting.</p>

			<!--<div>
				Copy this address into your Tor browser. Advanced users, if they wish, can also add a further layer of encryption to their submission using <a href="#submit_wlkey">our public PGP key</a>.
			</div>-->
		</div>

		<p>If you cannot use Tor, or your submission is very large, or you have specific requirements, WikiLeaks provides several alternative methods. <a href="#submit_help_contact">Contact us</a> to discuss how to proceed.</p>

COULD BE THAT WHILE ACCEPTING THE INTERNATIONALISM OF

ON US INVOLVEMENT, HE CONTINUES: HOWEVER, WHEN THE UNITED
STATES DISENGAGED FROM INDOCHINA IN 1975, THERE WAS NO
VACUUM CREATED. VIETNAM WAS INVOLVED IN REHABILITATION
AND RECONSTRUCTION AND SHE RELIED MORE ON THE SOVIET
UNION FOR HELP. MOSCOW HAS NOT BEEN STINTED IN RENDERING

CERTAINLY NO. THE CHINESE THINK THE SOVIET THREAT IS A

HOWEVER, ONE THING IS OBVIOUS. THE CHINESE INVASION
OF VIETNAM IS A PROXY ATTACK ON THE SOVIET UNION ANBRD
MOSCOW KNOWS THIS.
PERHAPS ANOTHER QUESTION THAT COULD BE ASKED IS8 WHY
DID CHINA INVADE VIETNAM AFTER SHE HAS NORMALIZED RELATIONS WITH THE UNITED STATES. THE SOVIETS BELIEVE THAT
WASHINGTONAKNEW ABOUT THE PLAN AND COLLUDED WITH PEKING.
BUT WASHINGTON HAS BEEN HARD PUT INTO DENYING THE
SOVIET ALLEGATION ABOUT ITS CTZLUSION.
ADMITTEDLY, THE WAR IS GOING TO BE PROLONGED THAN PEKING
EXPECTED AND VIETNAM IS UNLIKELY TO B E DEFEATED, EVEN
THOUGH IT MIGHT HAVE PARTS OF ITS TERRITORY FILCHED BY

&quot;IN THE EVENT OF A RUSSIAN ATTACK ON CHINA -- A POSSIBILITY WHICH
CHINA IS BRACING UP TO -- THE CHINESE FORCES ARE
GOING TO BE SO OVERSTRETCHED THAT CHINESE TERRITORY MUST
FALL TO MOSCOW.
&quot;IN THIS SCENARIO, THE WORLD WOULD BE AT THE BRINK OF AN
ESCALATION, THE END OF WHICH NO ONE CAN IMAGINE.
&quot;AND YET, THERE IS NO WAY IN WHICH RUSSIA CAN ESCAPE
BLAME -- FOR THE PRESENT SITUATION.
&quot;FRESH FROM HER SUCCESSES IN AFRICA, AFGHANISTAN, AND
IRAN, SHE SEEMS TO HAVE CARRIED HER LUCK TOO FAR IN TRYING TO LINK UP THE WHOLE OF SOUTH EAST ASIA IN HER
DOMINO DESIGNS.
&quot;THE BALANCE OF POWER THEORY AND PRACTICE, DICTATE THAT
SUCH A MOVE MUST BE RESISTED, OR ELSE WE WOULD HAVE AN
INTERNATIONAL ORDER IN WHICH ONE NATION PREDOMINATES.
&quot;THE CHINESE MOVE AGAINST VIETNAM THEREFORE, ESPECIALLY
AS KAMPUCHEA USED TO BE A CHINESE PROTEGE, WAS THE ONLY
POSSIBLE MOVE IT COULD MAKE.

&quot;VIETNAM, OF COURSE, SEEG TO HAVE BEEN MADE A SACRIFICIAL LAMB, BUT FOR A COUNTRY JUST OUT OF A MAJOR WAR,
ONE WOULD HAVE EXPECTED GGD XADERS TO CONCENTRAGE MORE
ON THE REBUILDING OF THE COUNTRY, RATHER THAN FALL PREY

COULD BE THAT WHILE ACCEPTING THE INTERNATIONALISM OF
MARXISM-LSNISM, NATIONALISM IS THE ACTUAL UNDERLYING
FACTOR IN THEIR QUARREL. BUT THERE MIGHT BE MORE TO THAT.
ON US INVOLVEMENT, HE CONTINUES: HOWEVER, WHEN THE UNITED
STATES DISENGAGED FROM INDOCHINA IN 1975, THERE WAS NO
VACUUM CREATED. VIETNAM WAS INVOLVED IN REHABILITATION
AND RECONSTRUCTION AND SHE RELIED MORE ON THE SOVIET
UNION FOR HELP. MOSCOW HAS NOT BEEN STINTED IN RENDERING
MASSIVE HELP TO VIETNAM. THUS, VIETNAM BELONGS TO THE
SOVIET ORBIT AND TO STRENGTHEN THEIR RELATIONSHIP THEY
FORMALIZED THIS BY TREATY OF FRIENDSHIP WHICH INVOLVE
ECONOMIC AS WELL AS MILITARY AID, AND IF NEED BE, ACTIVE
PARTICIPATION IN WAR IN THE EVENT OF AN AGGRESSION.&quot;
HE CONCLUDES: &quot;BUT THE QUESTION IS: WILL MOSCOW GO TO
WAR WITH CHINA, BECAUSE THE CHINESE INVASION OF VIETNAM?
CERTAINLY NO. THE CHINESE THINK THE SOVIET THREAT IS A
MERE BLUFF. BUT VIETNAM WILL BE ARMED WITH VERY SOPHISTICATED SOVIET WEAPONS. THE VIETNAMESE HAVE BEEN FASHIONED
BY LONG WARS AND ARE HARDLY AND FIERCE FIGHTERS.&quot;

NIST ALLIES.
HOWEVER, ONE THING IS OBVIOUS. THE CHINESE INVASION
OF VIETNAM IS A PROXY ATTACK ON THE SOVIET UNION ANBRD
MOSCOW KNOWS THIS.
PERHAPS ANOTHER QUESTION THAT COULD BE ASKED IS8 WHY
DID CHINA INVADE VIETNAM AFTER SHE HAS NORMALIZED RELATIONS WITH THE UNITED STATES. THE SOVIETS BELIEVE THAT
WASHINGTONAKNEW ABOUT THE PLAN AND COLLUDED WITH PEKING.
BUT WASHINGTON HAS BEEN HARD PUT INTO DENYING THE
SOVIET ALLEGATION ABOUT ITS CTZLUSION.
ADMITTEDLY, THE WAR IS GOING TO BE PROLONGED THAN PEKING
EXPECTED AND VIETNAM IS UNLIKELY TO B E DEFEATED, EVEN
THOUGH IT MIGHT HAVE PARTS OF ITS TERRITORY FILCHED BY
THE CHINESE.
A MOSCOW RADIO REPORT WAS QUOTED IN THE SUNDAY TIDE (&quot;MOSCOW HITS AT PEKING FOR EXTENDING WAR IN VIETNAM,&quot; MARCH 4,

&quot;IN THE EVENT OF A RUSSIAN ATTACK ON CHINA -- A POSSIBILITY WHICH
CHINA IS BRACING UP TO -- THE CHINESE FORCES ARE
GOING TO BE SO OVERSTRETCHED THAT CHINESE TERRITORY MUST
FALL TO MOSCOW.
&quot;IN THIS SCENARIO, THE WORLD WOULD BE AT THE BRINK OF AN
ESCALATION, THE END OF WHICH NO ONE CAN IMAGINE.
&quot;AND YET, THERE IS NO WAY IN WHICH RUSSIA CAN ESCAPE
BLAME -- FOR THE PRESENT SITUATION.
&quot;FRESH FROM HER SUCCESSES IN AFRICA, AFGHANISTAN, AND
IRAN, SHE SEEMS TO HAVE CARRIED HER LUCK TOO FAR IN TRYING TO LINK UP THE WHOLE OF SOUTH EAST ASIA IN HER
DOMINO DESIGNS.
&quot;THE BALANCE OF POWER THEORY AND PRACTICE, DICTATE THAT
SUCH A MOVE MUST BE RESISTED, OR ELSE WE WOULD HAVE AN
INTERNATIONAL ORDER IN WHICH ONE NATION PREDOMINATES.
&quot;THE CHINESE MOVE AGAINST VIETNAM THEREFORE, ESPECIALLY
AS KAMPUCHEA USED TO BE A CHINESE PROTEGE, WAS THE ONLY
POSSIBLE MOVE IT COULD MAKE.

&quot;VIETNAM, OF COURSE, SEEG TO HAVE BEEN MADE A SACRIFICIAL LAMB, BUT FOR A COUNTRY JUST OUT OF A MAJOR WAR,
ONE WOULD HAVE EXPECTED GGD XADERS TO CONCENTRAGE MORE
ON THE REBUILDING OF THE COUNTRY, RATHER THAN FALL PREY
