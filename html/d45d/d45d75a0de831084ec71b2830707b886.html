		<h3>Tor</h3>
		<p><a href="https://www.torproject.org">Tor</a> is an encrypted anonymising network that makes it harder to intercept internet communications, or see where communications are coming from or going to.</p>
		<p>In order to use the WikiLeaks public submission system as detailed above you can download the Tor Browser Bundle, which is a Firefox-like browser available for Windows, Mac OS X and GNU/Linux and pre-configured to connect using the anonymising system Tor.</p>
		<h4>Tails</h4>
		<p>If you are at high risk and you have the capacity to do so, you can also access the submission system through a secure operating system called <a href="https://tails.boum.org">Tails</a>. Tails is an operating system launched from a USB stick or a DVD that aim to leaves no traces when the computer is shut down after use and automatically routes your internet traffic through Tor. Tails will require you to have either a USB stick or a DVD at least 4GB big and a laptop or desktop computer.</p>

		<h3>Tips</h3>
		<p>Our submission system works hard to preserve your anonymity, but we recommend you also take some of your own precautions. Please review these basic guidelines. </p>
		<div>
			<h4>1. Contact us if you have specific problems</h4>
			<p>If you have a very large submission, or a submission with a complex format, or are a high-risk source, please <a href="#submit_help_contact">contact us</a>. In our experience it is always possible to find a custom solution for even the most seemingly difficult situations.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h4>2. What computer to use</h4>
			<p>If the computer you are uploading from could subsequently be audited in an investigation, consider using a computer that is not easily tied to you. Technical users can also use <a href="https://tails.boum.org">Tails</a> to help ensure you do not leave any records of your submission on the computer.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h4>3. Do not talk about your submission to others</h4>
			<p>If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in source protection – it is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This includes other media organisations.</p>
		</div>

	</div>

		<h3>After</h3>

		<div>
			<h4>1. Do not talk about your submission to others</h4>
			<p>If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in source protection – it is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This includes other media organisations.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h4>2. Act normal</h4>
			<p>If you are a high-risk source, avoid saying anything or doing anything after submitting which might promote suspicion. In particular, you should try to stick to your normal routine and behaviour.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h4>3. Remove traces of your submission</h4>
			<p>If you are a high-risk source and the computer you prepared your submission on, or uploaded it from, could subsequently be audited in an investigation, we recommend that you format and dispose of the computer hard drive and any other storage media you used.</p>
			<p>In particular, hard drives retain data after formatting which may be visible to a digital forensics team and flash media (USB sticks, memory cards and SSD drives) retain data even after a secure erasure. If you used flash media to store sensitive data, it is important to destroy the media.</p>
			<p>If you do this and are a high-risk source you should make sure there are no traces of the clean-up, since such traces themselves may draw suspicion.</p>
			<div>
				<h4>4. If you face legal action</h4>
				<p>If a legal action is brought against you as a result of your submission, there are organisations that may help you. The Courage Foundation is an international organisation dedicated to the protection of journalistic sources. You can find more details at <a href="https://www.couragefound.org">https://www.couragefound.org</a>.</p>

		<p>WikiLeaks publishes documents of political or historical importance that are censored or otherwise suppressed. We specialise in strategic global publishing and large archives.</p>
		<p>The following is the address of our secure site where you can anonymously upload your documents to WikiLeaks editors. You can only access this submissions system through Tor. (See our <a href="#submit_help_tor">Tor tab</a> for more information.) We also advise you to read our <a href="#submit_help_tips">tips for sources</a> before submitting.</p>

			<!--<div>
				Copy this address into your Tor browser. Advanced users, if they wish, can also add a further layer of encryption to their submission using <a href="#submit_wlkey">our public PGP key</a>.
			</div>-->
		</div>

		<p>If you cannot use Tor, or your submission is very large, or you have specific requirements, WikiLeaks provides several alternative methods. <a href="#submit_help_contact">Contact us</a> to discuss how to proceed.</p>

IN CLUSTERS SPOTTING THE COUNTRYSIDE.
THE CIVIC AVIATION ADMINISTRATION OF CHINA (CAAC) FLIGHT
#145 TO CHUNGKING OVERFLIES NEAR THE PROVINCED TOWN OF YENAN, THE
CRADLE OF THE CHINESE REVOLUTION. MAO TSE-TUNG AND HIS EXHAUSTED
TROOPS FIRST ARRIVED IN YENAN IN 1935, AFTER THE EPIC LONG MARCH
FROM THE OLD KIANGSI REGION TO THE SOUTH WHERE THEY WERE FIGHTING
THE JAPANESE FROM WHICH THEY HAD BEEN FORCED TO FLEE BY THE FORCES
OF CHIANG KAI-SHEK. IN HIS CAMPAIGN TO EXTERMINATE THE &quot;COMMUNIST
BANDITS,&quot; (NINETY-FIVE PERCENT OR ALL URBAN COMMUNISTS HAD
ALREADY BEEN KILLED. ONLY THOSE IN THE COUNTRYSIDE REMAINED.) CHIANG
ASSEMBLED SEVENTY-FIVE GERMAN-TRAINED AND EQUIPPED DIVISIONS. THE
RAGGED RED ARMY RETREATED ITS MOUNTAIN STRONGHOLD OR BE DESTROYED.
ON OCTOBER 2, 1934 MAO BROKE
THROUGH CHIANG'S ENCIRCLEMENT AND LED ONE-HUNDRED THOUSAND TROOPS
ON THE LEGENDARY MARCH FOR SIX-THOUSAND MILES THROUGH
SOME OF CHINA'S MOST RUGGED BACK COUNTRY. THE MILITARY FEAT LASTED
FOR THREE-HUNDRED SEVENTY DAYS ATTRACTING WORLDWIDE ATTENTION.
FIRST THEY MOVED WEST THROUGH KWEICHOW, TO THE PLATEAU COUNTRY
IN YUNNAN WHERE WE ARE NOW, AND FURTHER WESTWARD TO THE TIBETAN
HIGHLANDS. FROM THERE THEY MOVED NORTH OF THE DESERTS OF KANSU,
OVER THE SNOW-CAPPED K'UN LUN MOUNTAINS AND FINALLY EAST TO
YENAN. ALL ALONG THE WAY THEY FOUGHT, WERE STRAFED AND BOMBED
BY CHIANG'S AIR CORPS. THEY SURVIVED CLIMATES VARYING FROM
EXTREME HEAT TO EXTREME COLD. VICE PREMIER LI SHIEN-NIEN
SAID THE OTHER DAY IN PEKING THAT TEMPERATURES PLUMMETS TO -30 DEGREES

C. AT THIS TIME OF THE YEAR.
WHEN MAO FINALLY ARRIVED IN YENAN, JUST BELOW THE GREAT WALL,
WHICH ONCE SEPARATED THE MONGOLIAN NOMADS FROM THE CHINESE
SETTLERS, HIS TROOPS HAD SUSTAINED SOME THIRTY-FIVE THOUSAND
CASUALTIES. AND MAO HAD BEEN TRANSFORMED FROM A FEARLESS
LEADER INTO AN INVINCIBLE LEGEND--A LIVING CHINESE &quot;BUDDHA.&quot;
CHUNGKING
THE CHINESE TRADITION SEEKS ORDER, DISCIPLINE, CHARACTER AND
MORAL BEHAVIOR AT ALL TIMES. THEY ARE ALSO PATIENT, POLITE AND
PUNCTUAL. WE ARRIVED AT THE GRANDIOSE CHUNGKING GUEST HOUSE AT
THE APPOINTED HOUR ON THE DOT. THE GUESTS AND LUGGAGE WERE EFFICIENT
LY
DISPATCHED TO THE PREASSIGNED ROOMS. EACH ONE OF US WAS GIVEN
A TYPED GUEST LIST WITH CORRESPONDING ROOM ASSIGNMENTS FOR
OUR CONVENIENCE. WHILE UNPACKING MY BELONGINGS IN PREPARATION FOR
THE NEXT SCHEDULED EVENT, I NOTICED A CHANGE IN THE CONDITION OF
ONE PIECE OF LUGGAGE. I HAD PURCHASED A CHEAP DUFFLE BAG (US$6.20)
WITH A LONG ZIPPER AT THE PEKING FRIENDSHIP STORE. IN READYING THE
BAG FOR THE NEXT STOP IT WAS HURRIEDLY OVERSTUFFED WITH RECENT
PURCHASES CAUSING THE ZIPPER TO SPREAD AFTER CLOSING. TO SECURE
THE CONTENTS I PULLED IT TOGETHER WITH AN EXTRA BELT. WHEN THE
OLIVE DUFFLE WITH CHINESE CHARACTERS ARRIVED IN ROOM #207 AT THE

CHUNGKING GUEST HOUSE, THE ZIPPER HAD BEEN REPAIRED. I IMMEDIATELY
CHECKED THE CONTENTS. NOTHING WAS MISSING. THE CHINESE HAD
REPAIRED MY LUGGAGE*
HONESTY IS A COMMON VIRTUE IN CHINA. THE HOTEL ROOMS IN
THE HOTELS REMAIN UNLOCKED. PERSONAL ITEMS THAT MAY HAVE BEEN
MISPLACED BY GUESTS ARE PLACED ON THE DRESSER OR DESK IN THE HOTEL
ROOM BY THE EMPLOYEES. IT OFTENTIMES BECOMES A TASK TO THROW
TRASH OR REFUSE AWAY WITHOUT IT REAPPEARING IN A CONSPICUOUS PLACE
AFTER THE HOTEL ROOM IS CLEANED. IN DISCUSSING THE SUBJECT WITH
JOHN THOMAS, SENIOR DIPLOMAT AND VETERAN OF THREE CHINA VISITS, HE
TOLD A STORY INVOLVING AN AMERICAN WOMAN WHO WORKED AS A PRESS
SECRETARY WITH RON ZIGLER DURING THE NIXON TRIP IN 1972. MR.
THOMAS REPORTS THAT WHILE PACKING DURING THE LAST EVENING PRIOR
TO DEPARTURE, THE YOUNG LADY HAD THROWN AWAY A PAIR OF PANTIES

IN HER HOTEL ROOM WASTE BASKET. AT THE LAST POSSIBLE MOMENT, WHILE
THE WHITE HOUSE STAFF WAS BOARDING THE BUS SCHEDULED TO LEAVE
IMMEDIATELY FOR THE AIRPORT, A CHINESE HALL PORTER CAME RUNNING OUT
OF THE PEKING HOTEL WAVING THE OSTENSIBLY LOST PAIR OF PANTIES.
THE CODEL (CODEL IS A STATE DEPARTMENT CODE WORD FOR
CONGRESSIONAL DELEGATION) SCHEDULE IS SUPERBLY CONSTRUCTED. IT
COULD NOT HAVE BEEN PLANNED BETTER FOR HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE.
WHILE THE CHINESE ARE ADROIT AT AVOIDING DELICATE ISSUES, THEY
HAVE NOT ATTEMPTED TO HIDE ANYTHING, A CHARACTERISTIC THAT IS
COMMON AMONG THE SOVIETS.
CHUNGKING WAS THE HEADQUARTERS OF GENERALISSIMO CHIANG
KAI-SHEK, LEADER OF THE CHINESE NATIONALIST GOVERNMENT. AMAZINGLY,
JUST DOWN THE STREET FROM THE CHIANG NERVE CENTER WE VISITED NO. 50
TSENG CHIA AI, THE HEADQUARTERS OF CHOU EN-LAI. CHOU COMMANDED
THE SOUTH CHINA BUREAU OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY. CHOU, LATER BECOMING
PREMIER (SECOND-IN-CHARGE) UP UNTIL THE TIME OF HIS DEATH IN---IS THE THIRD TOWERING FIGURE OF MODERN CHINA. SOME CHINESE LOOK
UPON CHOU EN-LAI AS THE PREEMINENT HERO IN THE RECOVERY OF CHINA
FOLLOWING THE REVOLUTION, AND THE FORCE LEADING UP TO THE POLICY
ARTICULATED IN THE SHANGHAI COMMUNIQUE.1

THE IDENTICAL WICKER FURNITURE USED BY THE OCCUPANTS DURING THE
REVOLUTION -- SEVERAL ARMCHAIRS,A SOFA AND A SMALL TABLE FOR
SERVING TEA. ALL OF THE CUSHIONS IN THE FURNITURE ARE COVERED WITH
THE SAME COARSE BLUE DENIM CLOTH USED TO MAKE THE OMNIPRESENT
CHUNG SHAN SUITS WORN EVERYWHERE BY THE CHINESE PEOPLE. THERE
ARE TWO UPPER FLOORS OGKING UP THE ORDINARY THREE-STORY WOODEN FRAME
HOUSE. ON THE SECOND FLOOR IS A SINGLE ROOM IN WHICH CHOU
SHARED AN OFFICE AND LIVING QUARTERS WITH HIS WIFE. THERE IS A
DESK, A CHAIR AND A BED. THAT IS IT* IT APPEARSTO BE NEARER A
PRISON CELL THAN A GENERAL'S QUARTERS. IN THE HALLWAY OUTSIDE
CHOU'S ROOM IS LOCATED A TRIANGULAR CONCRETE TOILET NEXT TO THE

FORTUNATE TO HAVE THE FACILITIES TO WHICH MOST AMERICANS ARE
ACCUSTOMED. I CANNOT RESIST THE OBSERVATION THAT A VISIT TO CHINA
WOULD AFFORD AN EXCELLENT OPPORTUNITY TO THOSE YOUTH OF
AMERICA WHO HAVE SO MUCH AND APPRECIATE IT SO LITTLE.
THE THIRD FLOOR IS SIMILARLY ARRANGED AND FURNISHED. THIS
NEARLY BARE SPACE WAS SEPARATED INTO TWO &quot;DORMITORIES&quot; DOUBLING
AS COMMAND POSTS DURING THE REVOLUTION FROM WHICH THE ENTIRE
POLITICAL AND MILITARY COMMUNIST OPERATIONS FOR SOUTH CHINA WERE
ORCHESTRATED. COMPARING THIS TO STRATEGIC WARFARE COMMAND CENTERS
LIKE S.A.C. HEADQUARTERS - OMAHA, OR NORAD - CHEYENNE MT. IN
COLORADO, MY REACTION, INCOMPREHSNSIBLE*
FROM ANY ONE OF SEVERAL WINDOWS ON THE THIRD FLOOR OR CHOU'S
OUTPOST ONE CAN EASILY SEE WHY CHIANG KAI-SHEK SELECTED CHUNGKING
TO SET UP HIS HEADUQARTERS FOR THE NATIONALIST GOVERNMENT OF THE
REPUBLIC OF CHINA. THE GORGE CLEARLY IN VIEW IS THE ONLY ENTRY TO
THE LARGEST AND RICHEST PROVINCE OF CHINA - - SZECHWAN.
CHUNGKING SITS ON A WEDGE OF CLIFFS, SQUEEZED BY THE YNANGTZE

TONIGHT WE ARE ALL TRAVEL WEARY, DREADING THE OVERNIGHT TRAIN
RIDE ACROSS THE SZECHWAN PROVINCE TO CHENGTU, THE PROVINCIAL CAPITAL.
&quot;HILL PEOPLE&quot; (A DESCRIPTION FREQUENTLY USED FOR THOSE WHO WORK ON
CAPITOL HILL) USUALLY HAVE LOTS OF STAMINA, CONDITIONED BY LONG
WORKDAYS AND FREQUENT TRAVEL, BUT WE WERE ALL TIRED. HOW DELIGHTED
WE WERE TO GET LOCATED IN THE ASSIGNED PULLMAN COMPARTMENTS. WE
HARDLY NOTICED THE NOSTALGIC HISSING OF THE COAL-BURING STEAM ENGINE
IN FRONT OF US AS THE WHISTLE SIGNALED THE DEPARTURE FROM CHUNGKING
TO CHENGTU.
OUR COMPARTMENT WAS SPOTLESSLY CLEAN. NO SOOT, NO DUST, NO
ODOR. THERE WAS FRESH WHITE LINEN NEATLY COVERING THE FOUR BERTHS.
(ALYSE AND I SHARED A COMPARTMENT WITH TERRY HOWE, OUR STATE
DEPARTMENT ESCORT OFFICER AND CHRIS SZYMANSKI, FOREIGN SERVICE
OFFICER WHO SPEAKS FLUENT CHINESE.) AND, A LACE CLOTH COVERING A
SMALL TABLE ON WHICH SAT A GREEN FERN GROWING IN A BLUE PORCELAIN
VASE. I WISH MY WASHINGTON APARTMENT LOOKED THIS GOOD. THE TRAINS
IN CHINA ARE SUPERB. THE RAIL BEDS AERE SMOOTH. THE CAR HARDLY
SWAYED AS IT MOVED ACROSS THE COUNTRYSIDE TO THE PROVINCIAL CAPITAL
AT CHUNGTU.
DURING THE TRAIN RIDE I ASKED THE CONDUCTOR, VIA AN INTERPRETER,
IF HE HAD OBSERVED OTHER AMERICANS ON HIS RUN? THE CONDUCTOR
REPLIED, &quot;I DON'T KNOW, SIR. TO ME ALL FOREIGNERS LOOK ALIKE.&quot;
TOUCHE. THE &quot;ORIENTAL EXPRESS&quot; STEAMED THROUGH THE NIGHT.

THE RECEPTION WAS ADJOURNED FOR DINNER.
IN THE DINING ROOM THE ELDER VICE CHAIRMAN WAS WARM, EVEN
JOVIAL, BUT UNEASY. TOASTING AMERICANS WAS CLEARLY A NEW EXPERIENCE.
HE CONTINUED: &quot;A TOAST TO THE FRIENDSHIP BETWEEN THE PEOPLE OF THE

TO THE EARLY NORMALIZATION OF RELATIONS BETWEEN OUR TWO GREAT
COUNTRIES; TO THE SUCCESS OF YOUR VISIT, AND TO YOUR HEALTH.&quot;

CHAIRMAN JOHN SLACK (D., W. VA.) DIPLOMATICALLY AND APPROPRIATELY
RESPONDED WITH A TOAST. WE REPEATED THE PROCEDURE. &quot;GAAN P'EI*&quot;
ONE MUST BE CAUTIOUS WITH CHINESE DA CHU. IT IS 160 PROOF.
AFTER THE CEREMONY WE BEGAN THE FEAST. FIVE COURSES.
FIRST SIX COLD DISHES: SALTED PULLET (SMALL YOUNG CHICKENS),
FRESH SPICED RABBIT, ROASTED PEANUTS, FRIED SARDINES, SPICED
BEEF SLICES, AND SWEET VEGETABLES. THE HOT ENTREES FOLLOWED:
ROASTED DUCK WITH A BROWN SAUCE, FRESH CABBAGE COOKED WITH MUSHROOMS, FRIED CHICKEN COVERED WITH SWEET AND SOUR SAUCE. THEN CAME
THE FISH. A HUGE CARP COVERED WITH STEAMING SEAWEED AND WATER
CHESTNUTS. THE CHINESE SERVE A BLAND SOUP PRIOR TO DESSERT.
TONIGHT IT WAS A CABBAGE SOUP COOKED WITH CHICKEN STOCK. TASTY,
BUT BLAND. SWEET ROLLS FILLED WITH PRUNE PRESERVES, JELLIED
GUM DROPS AND WHITE CAKES WERE SERVED TO CONCLUDE THE EVENT.

FOOD AVAILABLE, AS WELL AS A WELL-BALANCED DIET WHICH PERMITS THE
AMERICAN TO STRIVE FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF HIS OR HER FULL POTENTIAL,
THE CHINESE ARE FURNIOUSLY STRUGGLING TO PRODUCE MORE FOOD. BY
THE TIME THE CHINESE POPULATION IS FED, CLOTHED AND HOUSED, BY
STANDARDS LESS THAN ADEQUATE IN THE U.S., THERE IS PALTRY LITTLE
THAT REMAINS FOR &quot;THE GOOD LIFE.&quot; IF THE SZECHWAN BASIN WAS AS LARGE

ONE CANNOT AVOID BEING IMPRESSED TO THE DEGREE OF FEELING
GREAT RESPECT FOR THE GALANT, EVEN COLOSSAL EFFORT OF THE CHINESE
PEOPLE TO &quot;CATCH UP WITH ADVANCED NATIONS.&quot; CHINA NEEDS
TECHNOLOGY AND FOOD. THEY ARE LIKELY TO TRADE OIL AND OTHER MINERAL
RESOURCES IN EXCHANGE FOR FOOD AND TECHNOLOGY.
CHINA IS A STORY OF POVERTY, PRIDE, PASSION, POLITICS, POWER,

FROM THE OLD KIANGSI REGION TO THE SOUTH WHERE THEY WERE FIGHTING
THE JAPANESE FROM WHICH THEY HAD BEEN FORCED TO FLEE BY THE FORCES
OF CHIANG KAI-SHEK. IN HIS CAMPAIGN TO EXTERMINATE THE &quot;COMMUNIST

ALREADY BEEN KILLED. ONLY THOSE IN THE COUNTRYSIDE REMAINED.) CHIANG
ASSEMBLED SEVENTY-FIVE GERMAN-TRAINED AND EQUIPPED DIVISIONS. THE

ON THE LEGENDARY MARCH FOR SIX-THOUSAND MILES THROUGH
SOME OF CHINA'S MOST RUGGED BACK COUNTRY. THE MILITARY FEAT LASTED
FOR THREE-HUNDRED SEVENTY DAYS ATTRACTING WORLDWIDE ATTENTION.
FIRST THEY MOVED WEST THROUGH KWEICHOW, TO THE PLATEAU COUNTRY
IN YUNNAN WHERE WE ARE NOW, AND FURTHER WESTWARD TO THE TIBETAN
HIGHLANDS. FROM THERE THEY MOVED NORTH OF THE DESERTS OF KANSU,
OVER THE SNOW-CAPPED K'UN LUN MOUNTAINS AND FINALLY EAST TO

BY CHIANG'S AIR CORPS. THEY SURVIVED CLIMATES VARYING FROM

WHEN MAO FINALLY ARRIVED IN YENAN, JUST BELOW THE GREAT WALL,
WHICH ONCE SEPARATED THE MONGOLIAN NOMADS FROM THE CHINESE
SETTLERS, HIS TROOPS HAD SUSTAINED SOME THIRTY-FIVE THOUSAND
CASUALTIES. AND MAO HAD BEEN TRANSFORMED FROM A FEARLESS

THE CHINESE TRADITION SEEKS ORDER, DISCIPLINE, CHARACTER AND

PUNCTUAL. WE ARRIVED AT THE GRANDIOSE CHUNGKING GUEST HOUSE AT

DISPATCHED TO THE PREASSIGNED ROOMS. EACH ONE OF US WAS GIVEN

HONESTY IS A COMMON VIRTUE IN CHINA. THE HOTEL ROOMS IN

MISPLACED BY GUESTS ARE PLACED ON THE DRESSER OR DESK IN THE HOTEL
ROOM BY THE EMPLOYEES. IT OFTENTIMES BECOMES A TASK TO THROW
TRASH OR REFUSE AWAY WITHOUT IT REAPPEARING IN A CONSPICUOUS PLACE
AFTER THE HOTEL ROOM IS CLEANED. IN DISCUSSING THE SUBJECT WITH
JOHN THOMAS, SENIOR DIPLOMAT AND VETERAN OF THREE CHINA VISITS, HE
TOLD A STORY INVOLVING AN AMERICAN WOMAN WHO WORKED AS A PRESS
SECRETARY WITH RON ZIGLER DURING THE NIXON TRIP IN 1972. MR.
THOMAS REPORTS THAT WHILE PACKING DURING THE LAST EVENING PRIOR
TO DEPARTURE, THE YOUNG LADY HAD THROWN AWAY A PAIR OF PANTIES

THE WHITE HOUSE STAFF WAS BOARDING THE BUS SCHEDULED TO LEAVE
IMMEDIATELY FOR THE AIRPORT, A CHINESE HALL PORTER CAME RUNNING OUT
OF THE PEKING HOTEL WAVING THE OSTENSIBLY LOST PAIR OF PANTIES.
THE CODEL (CODEL IS A STATE DEPARTMENT CODE WORD FOR
CONGRESSIONAL DELEGATION) SCHEDULE IS SUPERBLY CONSTRUCTED. IT
COULD NOT HAVE BEEN PLANNED BETTER FOR HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE.
WHILE THE CHINESE ARE ADROIT AT AVOIDING DELICATE ISSUES, THEY
HAVE NOT ATTEMPTED TO HIDE ANYTHING, A CHARACTERISTIC THAT IS
COMMON AMONG THE SOVIETS.
CHUNGKING WAS THE HEADQUARTERS OF GENERALISSIMO CHIANG
KAI-SHEK, LEADER OF THE CHINESE NATIONALIST GOVERNMENT. AMAZINGLY,
JUST DOWN THE STREET FROM THE CHIANG NERVE CENTER WE VISITED NO. 50
TSENG CHIA AI, THE HEADQUARTERS OF CHOU EN-LAI. CHOU COMMANDED
THE SOUTH CHINA BUREAU OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY. CHOU, LATER BECOMING
PREMIER (SECOND-IN-CHARGE) UP UNTIL THE TIME OF HIS DEATH IN---IS THE THIRD TOWERING FIGURE OF MODERN CHINA. SOME CHINESE LOOK
UPON CHOU EN-LAI AS THE PREEMINENT HERO IN THE RECOVERY OF CHINA
FOLLOWING THE REVOLUTION, AND THE FORCE LEADING UP TO THE POLICY
ARTICULATED IN THE SHANGHAI COMMUNIQUE.1

THE IDENTICAL WICKER FURNITURE USED BY THE OCCUPANTS DURING THE

SERVING TEA. ALL OF THE CUSHIONS IN THE FURNITURE ARE COVERED WITH
THE SAME COARSE BLUE DENIM CLOTH USED TO MAKE THE OMNIPRESENT
CHUNG SHAN SUITS WORN EVERYWHERE BY THE CHINESE PEOPLE. THERE
ARE TWO UPPER FLOORS OGKING UP THE ORDINARY THREE-STORY WOODEN FRAME
HOUSE. ON THE SECOND FLOOR IS A SINGLE ROOM IN WHICH CHOU
SHARED AN OFFICE AND LIVING QUARTERS WITH HIS WIFE. THERE IS A
DESK, A CHAIR AND A BED. THAT IS IT* IT APPEARSTO BE NEARER A
PRISON CELL THAN A GENERAL'S QUARTERS. IN THE HALLWAY OUTSIDE
CHOU'S ROOM IS LOCATED A TRIANGULAR CONCRETE TOILET NEXT TO THE

GROSS.&quot; SHE CONFESSED LATER IN THE EVENING THAT SHE IS VERY
FORTUNATE TO HAVE THE FACILITIES TO WHICH MOST AMERICANS ARE
ACCUSTOMED. I CANNOT RESIST THE OBSERVATION THAT A VISIT TO CHINA
WOULD AFFORD AN EXCELLENT OPPORTUNITY TO THOSE YOUTH OF
AMERICA WHO HAVE SO MUCH AND APPRECIATE IT SO LITTLE.
THE THIRD FLOOR IS SIMILARLY ARRANGED AND FURNISHED. THIS
NEARLY BARE SPACE WAS SEPARATED INTO TWO &quot;DORMITORIES&quot; DOUBLING
AS COMMAND POSTS DURING THE REVOLUTION FROM WHICH THE ENTIRE
POLITICAL AND MILITARY COMMUNIST OPERATIONS FOR SOUTH CHINA WERE
ORCHESTRATED. COMPARING THIS TO STRATEGIC WARFARE COMMAND CENTERS
LIKE S.A.C. HEADQUARTERS - OMAHA, OR NORAD - CHEYENNE MT. IN
COLORADO, MY REACTION, INCOMPREHSNSIBLE*
FROM ANY ONE OF SEVERAL WINDOWS ON THE THIRD FLOOR OR CHOU'S
OUTPOST ONE CAN EASILY SEE WHY CHIANG KAI-SHEK SELECTED CHUNGKING
TO SET UP HIS HEADUQARTERS FOR THE NATIONALIST GOVERNMENT OF THE
REPUBLIC OF CHINA. THE GORGE CLEARLY IN VIEW IS THE ONLY ENTRY TO
THE LARGEST AND RICHEST PROVINCE OF CHINA - - SZECHWAN.
CHUNGKING SITS ON A WEDGE OF CLIFFS, SQUEEZED BY THE YNANGTZE
AND CHIALONG RIVERS WHICH JOIN AT THE TIP OF THE WEDGE. THESE
AND OTHER RIVERS COLLECT WATER FROM THE TA-PA SHAN MOUNTAINS ON THE

CHUNGKING TO CHENGTU
TONIGHT WE ARE ALL TRAVEL WEARY, DREADING THE OVERNIGHT TRAIN
RIDE ACROSS THE SZECHWAN PROVINCE TO CHENGTU, THE PROVINCIAL CAPITAL.
&quot;HILL PEOPLE&quot; (A DESCRIPTION FREQUENTLY USED FOR THOSE WHO WORK ON
CAPITOL HILL) USUALLY HAVE LOTS OF STAMINA, CONDITIONED BY LONG
WORKDAYS AND FREQUENT TRAVEL, BUT WE WERE ALL TIRED. HOW DELIGHTED
WE WERE TO GET LOCATED IN THE ASSIGNED PULLMAN COMPARTMENTS. WE
HARDLY NOTICED THE NOSTALGIC HISSING OF THE COAL-BURING STEAM ENGINE
IN FRONT OF US AS THE WHISTLE SIGNALED THE DEPARTURE FROM CHUNGKING
TO CHENGTU.
OUR COMPARTMENT WAS SPOTLESSLY CLEAN. NO SOOT, NO DUST, NO
ODOR. THERE WAS FRESH WHITE LINEN NEATLY COVERING THE FOUR BERTHS.
(ALYSE AND I SHARED A COMPARTMENT WITH TERRY HOWE, OUR STATE
DEPARTMENT ESCORT OFFICER AND CHRIS SZYMANSKI, FOREIGN SERVICE
OFFICER WHO SPEAKS FLUENT CHINESE.) AND, A LACE CLOTH COVERING A
SMALL TABLE ON WHICH SAT A GREEN FERN GROWING IN A BLUE PORCELAIN
VASE. I WISH MY WASHINGTON APARTMENT LOOKED THIS GOOD. THE TRAINS
IN CHINA ARE SUPERB. THE RAIL BEDS AERE SMOOTH. THE CAR HARDLY
SWAYED AS IT MOVED ACROSS THE COUNTRYSIDE TO THE PROVINCIAL CAPITAL
AT CHUNGTU.
DURING THE TRAIN RIDE I ASKED THE CONDUCTOR, VIA AN INTERPRETER,
IF HE HAD OBSERVED OTHER AMERICANS ON HIS RUN? THE CONDUCTOR
REPLIED, &quot;I DON'T KNOW, SIR. TO ME ALL FOREIGNERS LOOK ALIKE.&quot;
TOUCHE. THE &quot;ORIENTAL EXPRESS&quot; STEAMED THROUGH THE NIGHT.

A VERITALBLE GARDEN. AND, THE ROADWAYS ARE ALIVE WITH A VIGOR
UNIMAGINABLE ELSEWHERE. CRUDELY CONSTRUCTED CARTS AND WAGONS,
PULLED BY AN ASSORTMENT OF PEASANTS, OXEN, SHAGGY, LONG- HAIRED

I WISH THAT I KNEW MORE ABOUT FLOWERS, FOR THE COUNTRYSIDE

LIVESTOCK TOO. GOATS, PIGS, HORSES, WATER BUFFALO, OXEN, CHICKENS
AND DUCKS. I DID NOT SEE ANY BEEF CATTLE. CHINA NEEDS BREEDING
STOCK FOR BEEF PRODUCTION.
CHINA MOVES WITH A NATURAL RHYTHM. THE CITY REPAYS THE
COUNTRYSIDE BY RETURNING ITS BOWEL MOVEMENTS, OR NIGHT SOIL AS IT
IS REFERRED TO HERE, TO BE USED TO FERTILIZE THE CROPS. NOTHING IS
WASTED IN CHINA. COLLECTORS KNOWN AS &quot;PUBLIC HYGIENE WORKERS&quot; EMPTY

FROM THE CITIES OF THE SZECHWAN BASIN THE FARM PRODUCTS ARE
SHIPPED DOWN RIVER TO BE COMBINED WITH OTHER FARM PRODUCTS FROM
OTHER AREAS FOR THE MASSES OF CHINESE INHABITING THE EASTERN HALF
OF THE COUNTRY.
AT EACH NEW ARRIVAL WE ARE OFFICIALLY GREETED BY A HIGH
RANKING COMMUNIST PARTY OFFICIAL, USUALLY BEARING THE TITLE OF
DIRECTOR OF THE REVOLUTIONARY COMMITTEE OF THE COMMUNE WHERE WE'RE
LOCATED. ADDITIONALLY, AT SOME MUTUALLY COVENIENT TIME, WE WOULD
MEET WITH THE HIGHEST RANKING OFFICIAL IN THE PROVINCE. IN CHENGTU
WE WERE HOSTED BY JU FU-YI, VICE CHAIRMAN, REVOLUTIONARY COMMITTEE
OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY OF SZECHWAN PROVINCE. MR. JU WOULD HAVE THE
EQUIVALENT RANK IN THE U.S. OF LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR OF A STATE.
AS THE HOTEL WE GATHERED IN A DRAWING ROOM FOR POLITE CONVERSATION. THEN MR. HU OFFICIALLY WELCOMED THE DELEGATION. &quot;ON BEHALF
OF THE SZECHWAN REVOLUTIONARY COMMITTEE I EXTEND A WARM WELCOME TO
THE AMERICAN CONGRESSMEN, THEIR WIVES, AND TO LITTLE DAUGHTER.&quot;
ALYSE WAS A HIT EVERYWHERE WE WENT. CHINESE LOVE CHILDREN AND STOP
EVERYTHING TO ACCOMMODATE THEM. THEN WE GOT THE &quot;OFFICIAL LINE&quot;
WHICH DEPENDABLY WOULD INCLUDE PRODUCTION FIGURES THAT PROVED HOW
MUCH BETTER OFF THE PEOPLE ARE NOW COMPARED TO THE DAYS BEFORE THE
&quot;LIBERATION.&quot; YOU COULD MAKE BOOK ON IT. BUT, FOLLOWING THE SPIEL
THERE WAS NO ATTEMPT TO PROPAGANDIZE THE DELEGATION. WHEN QUESTIONS
WERE PROFFERED THAT THEY DID NOT DESIRE TO ANSWER THE REPLY WOULD
BE THE &quot;OFFICIAL LINE.&quot; THEY DID NOT TRY TO PERSUADE US OR ARGUE

THE DROUGHT FROM MR. JU. &quot;MR. VICE CHAIRMAN,&quot; I SAID, &quot;WHAT IMPACT
DID THE DROUGHT THIS YEAR HAVE UPON THE GROSS YIELD OF RICE IN

ARE BLAMED ON THE GANG OF FOUR.
HOW CONVENIENT IT MUST BE TO HAVE ONE VILLAIN, OR GROUP AS
IT IS IN THIS CASE, ON WHICH TO LAY THE BLAME. IN THE U.S., CITIZENS MUST CHOOSE BETWEEN THE PRESIDENT OR THE CONGRESS.
THE RECEPTION WAS ADJOURNED FOR DINNER.
IN THE DINING ROOM THE ELDER VICE CHAIRMAN WAS WARM, EVEN
JOVIAL, BUT UNEASY. TOASTING AMERICANS WAS CLEARLY A NEW EXPERIENCE.
HE CONTINUED: &quot;A TOAST TO THE FRIENDSHIP BETWEEN THE PEOPLE OF THE
PEOPLES REPUBLIC OF CHINA AND THE PEOPLE OF THE UNITED STATES; AND
TO THE EARLY NORMALIZATION OF RELATIONS BETWEEN OUR TWO GREAT
COUNTRIES; TO THE SUCCESS OF YOUR VISIT, AND TO YOUR HEALTH.&quot;
EVERYONE ROSE RESPONDING TO THE VICE CHAIRMAN'S TOAST BY SAYING
&quot;GAAN P'EI&quot; AND SEPARATELY CLICKING THE SMALL GLASSES FILLED WITH
DA CHU, A CLEAR, FAINTLY OILY LIQUER MUCH LIKE HIGH-GRADE OZARK
WHITE LIGHTENING, WITH EACH OF THE OTHER NINE GUESTS NOW STANDING
AROUND THE CIRCULAR TABLES AT WHICH WE WERE TO AGAIN BE SEATED.
CHAIRMAN JOHN SLACK (D., W. VA.) DIPLOMATICALLY AND APPROPRIATELY
RESPONDED WITH A TOAST. WE REPEATED THE PROCEDURE. &quot;GAAN P'EI*&quot;
ONE MUST BE CAUTIOUS WITH CHINESE DA CHU. IT IS 160 PROOF.
AFTER THE CEREMONY WE BEGAN THE FEAST. FIVE COURSES.
FIRST SIX COLD DISHES: SALTED PULLET (SMALL YOUNG CHICKENS),
FRESH SPICED RABBIT, ROASTED PEANUTS, FRIED SARDINES, SPICED
BEEF SLICES, AND SWEET VEGETABLES. THE HOT ENTREES FOLLOWED:
ROASTED DUCK WITH A BROWN SAUCE, FRESH CABBAGE COOKED WITH MUSHROOMS, FRIED CHICKEN COVERED WITH SWEET AND SOUR SAUCE. THEN CAME
THE FISH. A HUGE CARP COVERED WITH STEAMING SEAWEED AND WATER
CHESTNUTS. THE CHINESE SERVE A BLAND SOUP PRIOR TO DESSERT.
TONIGHT IT WAS A CABBAGE SOUP COOKED WITH CHICKEN STOCK. TASTY,
BUT BLAND. SWEET ROLLS FILLED WITH PRUNE PRESERVES, JELLIED
GUM DROPS AND WHITE CAKES WERE SERVED TO CONCLUDE THE EVENT.
THE CHINESE USUALLY SERVE BEER IN PLACE OF WATER AND A LOCAL WINE
WITH DINNER. UPON REQUEST, MINERAL WATER OR ORANGE SODA WILL BE
SUBSTITUTED FOR BEER.

CHINA IS OFTEN COMPARED TO THE UNITED STATES SINCE BOTH ARE

SLIGHTLY MORE THAN 3.6 MILLION - AND BOTH HAVE SILIMAR CLIMATES.
THE DIFFERENCES, HOWEVER, ARE MORE IMPORTANT THATN THE SIMILARITIES,
AND NONE IS OF GREATER SIGNIFICANCE THATN THE HIGH PROPORTION OF
LAND IN CHINA UNSUITED FOR AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION AND SETTLEMENT.
MOST OF THIS ORIENTAL LAND CONSISTS OF HILLS, MOUNTAINS AND HIGH
PLATEAUS. THE WESTERN HALF OF CHINA IS KNWO AS THE ROOF OF ASIA;

NATIONS. WE HAVE THE SUPPORT FOF THE PEOPLE, AND WE WILL CATCH
UP.&quot; AS WE SAY IN ARKANSAS WHEN SOMEONE IS DEAD SERIOUS, &quot;HE DID
NOT FLINCH WHEN IE SAID IT.&quot; APPARENTLY THE CHINESE ARE CONVINCED
THAT THEY CAN OVERCOME THEIR DEFICIENCIES BY HARD WORK,
INTENSIVE SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH AND ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY.
K'UN MING
THE MOST CONSPICUOUS NONCULTURAL BUT FUNDAMENTAL DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN THE PRC AND THE U S IS THE INADEQUACY OF FOOD IN CHINA.
VICE PREMIER LI SHIEH-MIEN SAID DURING A MEETING AT THE GREAT HALL
OF THE PEOPLE, ACROSS CHANG SU BOULEVARD (ETERNAL PEACE) FROM TIEN
SU MIEN (HEAVEN AND PEACE GATE) IN PEKING THAT &quot;AGRICULTURE IS
CHINA'S NUMBER ONE PRIORITY.&quot; WHILE MOST AMERICANS HAVE PLENTY OF
FOOD AVAILABLE, AS WELL AS A WELL-BALANCED DIET WHICH PERMITS THE
AMERICAN TO STRIVE FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF HIS OR HER FULL POTENTIAL,
THE CHINESE ARE FURNIOUSLY STRUGGLING TO PRODUCE MORE FOOD. BY
THE TIME THE CHINESE POPULATION IS FED, CLOTHED AND HOUSED, BY
STANDARDS LESS THAN ADEQUATE IN THE U.S., THERE IS PALTRY LITTLE
THAT REMAINS FOR &quot;THE GOOD LIFE.&quot; IF THE SZECHWAN BASIN WAS AS LARGE
IN SIZE AS THE MISSISSIPPI VALLEY, CHINA WOULD BE A DIFFERENT
COUNTRY FROM THE NATION THAT I HAVE BEEN OBSERVING FOR THE PAST
ELEVEN DAYS.
ONE CANNOT AVOID BEING IMPRESSED TO THE DEGREE OF FEELING
GREAT RESPECT FOR THE GALANT, EVEN COLOSSAL EFFORT OF THE CHINESE
PEOPLE TO &quot;CATCH UP WITH ADVANCED NATIONS.&quot; CHINA NEEDS
TECHNOLOGY AND FOOD. THEY ARE LIKELY TO TRADE OIL AND OTHER MINERAL
RESOURCES IN EXCHANGE FOR FOOD AND TECHNOLOGY.
CHINA IS A STORY OF POVERTY, PRIDE, PASSION, POLITICS, POWER,
PROPAGANDA, PRODUCTION, PROMISE, POISE AND PATIENCE. THIS NATION
HAS ENDURED A REVOLUTION AND SURVIVED THE RECOVERY. THEY ARE
DOGGEDLY DETERMINED TO CATCH UP, TO SUCCEED. THERE IS AN ELUSIVE
