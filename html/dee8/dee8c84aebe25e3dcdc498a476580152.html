		<h3>Tor</h3>
		<p><a href="https://www.torproject.org">Tor</a> is an encrypted anonymising network that makes it harder to intercept internet communications, or see where communications are coming from or going to.</p>
		<p>In order to use the WikiLeaks public submission system as detailed above you can download the Tor Browser Bundle, which is a Firefox-like browser available for Windows, Mac OS X and GNU/Linux and pre-configured to connect using the anonymising system Tor.</p>
		<h4>Tails</h4>
		<p>If you are at high risk and you have the capacity to do so, you can also access the submission system through a secure operating system called <a href="https://tails.boum.org">Tails</a>. Tails is an operating system launched from a USB stick or a DVD that aim to leaves no traces when the computer is shut down after use and automatically routes your internet traffic through Tor. Tails will require you to have either a USB stick or a DVD at least 4GB big and a laptop or desktop computer.</p>

		<h3>Tips</h3>
		<p>Our submission system works hard to preserve your anonymity, but we recommend you also take some of your own precautions. Please review these basic guidelines. </p>
		<div>
			<h4>1. Contact us if you have specific problems</h4>
			<p>If you have a very large submission, or a submission with a complex format, or are a high-risk source, please <a href="#submit_help_contact">contact us</a>. In our experience it is always possible to find a custom solution for even the most seemingly difficult situations.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h4>2. What computer to use</h4>
			<p>If the computer you are uploading from could subsequently be audited in an investigation, consider using a computer that is not easily tied to you. Technical users can also use <a href="https://tails.boum.org">Tails</a> to help ensure you do not leave any records of your submission on the computer.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h4>3. Do not talk about your submission to others</h4>
			<p>If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in source protection – it is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This includes other media organisations.</p>
		</div>

	</div>

		<h3>After</h3>

		<div>
			<h4>1. Do not talk about your submission to others</h4>
			<p>If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in source protection – it is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This includes other media organisations.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h4>2. Act normal</h4>
			<p>If you are a high-risk source, avoid saying anything or doing anything after submitting which might promote suspicion. In particular, you should try to stick to your normal routine and behaviour.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h4>3. Remove traces of your submission</h4>
			<p>If you are a high-risk source and the computer you prepared your submission on, or uploaded it from, could subsequently be audited in an investigation, we recommend that you format and dispose of the computer hard drive and any other storage media you used.</p>
			<p>In particular, hard drives retain data after formatting which may be visible to a digital forensics team and flash media (USB sticks, memory cards and SSD drives) retain data even after a secure erasure. If you used flash media to store sensitive data, it is important to destroy the media.</p>
			<p>If you do this and are a high-risk source you should make sure there are no traces of the clean-up, since such traces themselves may draw suspicion.</p>
			<div>
				<h4>4. If you face legal action</h4>
				<p>If a legal action is brought against you as a result of your submission, there are organisations that may help you. The Courage Foundation is an international organisation dedicated to the protection of journalistic sources. You can find more details at <a href="https://www.couragefound.org">https://www.couragefound.org</a>.</p>

		<p>WikiLeaks publishes documents of political or historical importance that are censored or otherwise suppressed. We specialise in strategic global publishing and large archives.</p>
		<p>The following is the address of our secure site where you can anonymously upload your documents to WikiLeaks editors. You can only access this submissions system through Tor. (See our <a href="#submit_help_tor">Tor tab</a> for more information.) We also advise you to read our <a href="#submit_help_tips">tips for sources</a> before submitting.</p>

			<!--<div>
				Copy this address into your Tor browser. Advanced users, if they wish, can also add a further layer of encryption to their submission using <a href="#submit_wlkey">our public PGP key</a>.
			</div>-->
		</div>

		<p>If you cannot use Tor, or your submission is very large, or you have specific requirements, WikiLeaks provides several alternative methods. <a href="#submit_help_contact">Contact us</a> to discuss how to proceed.</p>

A. INTERNAL POLITICS
1. A LITTLE MORE THAN A YEAR HAS PASSED SINCE THE REHABILITATION OF TENG HSIAO-PING, WHOSE PRAGMATIC POLICIES, PARTICULARLY IN THE AREA OF ECONOMIC RELATIONS WITH OTHER COUNTRIES, APPEAR TO HAVE BECOME FIRMLY ENTRENCHED. DESPITE
SOME SIGNS OF TENSION WITHIN THE LEADERSHIP, A SENSE OF

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
HISTORICAL RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF CHINA'S
ECONOMY AND FOR THE RESTORATION OF CHINA TO ITS &quot;RIGHTFUL
PLACE&quot; IN THE WORLD, AS WELL AS THE INABILITY OF ANY SINGLE
LEADER TO ACHIEVE DOMINANCE SHOULD HOLD THE LEADERSHIP TOGETHER, AT LEAST FOR THE TIME BEING.
2. THE TENG ASCENDANCY. OVER THE PAST MONTHS THE CHINESE
GOVERNMENT HAS: MOVED TO OVERHAUL THE EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM,
WITH A RETURN TO EMPHASIS ON ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE; DECIDED
TO SEND THOUSANDS OF STUDENTS ABROAD FOR ACADEMIC TRAINING; IMPLEMENTED A PROGRAM OF MATERIAL INCENTIVES TO IMPROVE PRODUCTIVITY; BEGUN A SHIFT TO A MODERNIZED,MORE
PROFESSIONAL ARMY; BEGUN TO DETERMINE MEANS BY WHICH
COOPERATION WITH FOREIGN COMPANIES IN EXPLOITING CHINA'S
NATURAL RESOURCES MIGHT BE ACCOMPLISHED; APPROVED THE
EXPANDED USE OF CREDITS TO FACILITATE THE IMPORTATION OF
WESTERN TECHNOLOGY. MANY OF THESE MOVES WOULD HAVE SEEMED
IMPOSSIBLE AS RECENTLY AS TWO YEARS AGO, AND ALL OF THEM
ARE, TO A CONSIDERABLE DEGREE, ASSOCIATED WITH TENG HSIAOPING.
3. KEY APPOINTMENTS IN THE CHINESE POLICY APPARATUS HAVE
GIVEN TENG A FIRM GRIP ON SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY MATTERS
AND STRONG INFLUENCE ON RELATED BUDGETARY, EDUCATION, AND
TRADE MATTERS. HE DOMINATES MILITARY REORGANIZATION
CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL
PAGE 03

STATE 256102

EFFORTS AND HAS MADE GAINS IN PROPAGANDA, PARTY, AND
SECURITY MATTERS.
4. CONTROL OVER CULTURE, EDUCATION, AND THE MEDIA, HOWEVER, REMAINS DIVIDED BETWEEN THOSE LOYAL TO TENG AND
THOSE IDENTIFIED WITH CHAIRMAN HUA KUO-FENG. PARTY AND
SECURITY MATTERS, AS WELL, ARE STRONGLY INFLUENCED BY
HUA AND HIS SUPPORTERS, VICE CHAIRMAN WANG TUNG-HSING AND
POLITBURO MEMBER CHI TENG-KUEI. AS HEAD OF PARTY SECURITY, WANG, FOR INSTANCE, RETAINS CONTROL OF DOSSIERS AND
FILES, INCLUDING MAO'S PAPERS, AND THUS HAS A MAJOR VOICE
IN PURGES, REHABILITATIONS, AND THE WRITING OF PARTY
HISTORY.
5. WHAT DOES TENG WANT? IN ADDITION TO THEIR PRIMARY
GOAL OF MODERNIZING CHINA,ON WHICH A BASIC CONSENSUS EMBRACING ALL OF THE CENTRAL LEADERSHIP NOW SEEMS TO EXIST,
TENG AND HIS FOLLOWERS SEEK A VINDICATION OF THEIR EARLY
CAREER RECORDS, AT LEAST A PARTIAL REPUDIATION OF THE
CULTURAL REVOLUTION, AND A DESANCTIFICATION OF MAO. ON
THESE LAST THREE ISSUES THERE IS NO CONSENSUS AND TENG
AND HIS ASSOCIATES HAVE CONTINUED TO MANUEVER AGAINST

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
POLITBURO MEMBERS AND OTHERS ONCE ASSOCIATED WITH THE
&quot;GANG OF FOUR&quot; AND THE EFFORT TO PREVENT TENG'S 1977 REHABILITATION.
6. TENG HAS BEEN LIKE A STEAMROLLER, RELENTLESSLY PRESSING FORWARD. WITH DETERMINATION, BOLDNESS, AND WELLPLACED, TIMELY SUPPORT FROM HIS LIEUTENANTS IN THE PROPAGANDA AND MEDIA FIELDS, HE HAS LARGELY SUCCEEDED IN
GETTING HIS WAY. HE PROMISES TO BECOME THE PRIMARY INTERPRETER OF MAO'S THOUGHTS. HE HAS SKILLFULLY USED SUCH
EARLY THEORETICAL WORKS OF MAO AS &quot;ON PRACTICE,&quot; THE
1944 SPEECH &quot;ON THE PROBLEM OF POLITICAL WORK FOR ARMYMEN,&quot; AND THE 1962 SPEECH TO THE ENLARGED WORK CONFERENCE
CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL
PAGE 04

STATE 256102

WHICH SUPPORTED HIS THEN MODERATE APPROACH AND POLICIES.
7. WITH INCREASING SUCCESS, TENG AND HIS ALLIES HAVE
OVERCOME THE CONTENTION THAT THE EXAMINATION OF CHINA'S
RECENT TROUBLES SHOULD STOP AT THE GANG OF FOUR ERA. THEY
HAVE USED THE MEDIA SKILLFULLY TO PAINT A DARK PICTURE OF
THE CULTURAL REVOLUTION AND TO BUILD SYMPATHY FOR ITS
VICTIMS, I.E. THEMSELVES.
8. WITH SOMEWHAT LESS SUCCESS, TENG, WEI KUO-CHING, AND
OTHER PLA LEADERS CLOSE TO TENG, HAVE KEPT UP PRESSURE
ON THOSE PLA LEADERS WHO ROSE UNDER THE PATRONAGE OF
LIN PIAO. THE MOST PROMINENT MEMBERS OF THIS GROUP ARE
CHEN HSI-LIEN AND LI TE-SHENG, GENERALLY CONSIDERED TO BE
TWO OF HUA KUO-FENG'S CLOSEST ALLIES. AT THE RECENT PLA
POLITICAL WORK CONFERENCE, HUA AND VICE-CHAIRMAN YEH CHIENYING TOOK POSITIONS IN OPPOSITION TO TENG ON THE QUESTION
OF WHETHER OR NOT ADHERENTS OF LIN PIAO HAD BEEN CLEANED
OUT OF THE PLA. BUT, SUCH RECENT EVIDENCE AS THE PURGE
OF LIN PIAO SUPPORTERS IN THE CANTON MILITARY REGION
SUGGESTS THAT TENG MAY BE GETTING HIS WAY ON THIS ISSUE
AS WELL.
9. TENG AND HIS ALLIES ARE ALSO CONTINUING THEIR EFFORTS
TO WEAKEN THE BENEFICIARIES OF THE CULTURAL REVOLUTION
AT THE CENTER AND IN THE PROVINCES. PEKING PARTY FIRST
SECRETARY AND POLITBURO MEMBER WU TE, IN PARTICULAR,
HAS BEEN THE TARGET OF A CONTINUING CAMPAIGN. AT OTHER
TIMES THE TENG FORCES SEEM TO HAVE AIMED VARIOUSLY AT
WANG TUNG-HSING, CHEN HSI-LIEN, AND LI TE-SHENG, THOUGH
ALL OF THESE SEEM TO BE FARING SOMEWHAT BETTER THAN WU
TE.

10. WHO IS IN OPPOSITION? THAT TENG HSIAO-PING IS THE
CUTTING EDGE OF THE MODERNIZATION DRIVE IS QUITE CLEAR;
JUST WHO BELONGS TO THE COALITION &quot;OPPOSING&quot; HIM AND PRECISELY WHAT THEY WANT IS SOMEWHAT LESS CLEAR.
11. IT MUST BE EMPHASIZED THAT THERE IS A BASIC CONSENSUS AMONG ALL THE CENTRAL LEADERSHIP FIGURES ON THE
IDEA OF MODERNIZATION; DIFFERENCES ARISE OVER POWER AND
PERSONALITY, METHODS TO ACHIEVE GOALS, AND, PERHAPS, OVER
JUST WHAT &quot;MODERNIZATION&quot; MEANS.
12. WU TE, WANG TUNG-HSING, CHEN HSI-LIEN, AND LI TESHENG, AS CONSPICUOUS OFFICE HOLDERS AS WELL AS BENEFICIARIES OF THE CULTURAL REVOLUTION, HAVE ALL BEEN TARGETS
AT ONE TIME OR ANOTHER OF TENG AND/OR HIS FOLLOWERS. FOR
REASONS OF SHEER SELF-PRESERVATION THEY HAVE ALL AT VARIOUS TIMES BEEN IDENTIFIED WITH OPPOSITION TO TENG AND
HIS POLICIES.
13. ECONOMIC SPECIALIST LI HSIEN-NIEN, LONG REGARDED AS
AN ALLY OF TENG, MAY HAVE OPPOSED HIM ON SOME ISSUES
IN RECENT MONTHS. IT IS UNCLEAR, HOWEVER, WHETHER THIS
WAS DUE TO RESENTMENT OF TENG'S BULLDOZER TACTICS OR TO
INNATE CAUTION AND A FEELING THAT TENG WAS MOVING TOO
RAPIDLY.
14. WHILE THIS OPPOSITION IS MORE PERSONAL THAN IDEOLOGICAL, THE FAR-REACHING NATURE OF THE POLICY CHANGES
PURSUED BY TENG AND HIS FOLLOWERS HAS PRECIPITATED A
SERIOUS POLICY DEBATE AT THE CENTER. THIS DEBATE WAS
EVIDENT IN THE CONFLICTING LINES TAKEN BY HUA AND TENG
IN THE SPEECHES EACH GAVE AT THE CONFERENCE ON SCIENCE
AND TECHNOLOGY AND POLITICAL WORK IN THE PLA. WHEREAS
TENG HAS WARNED AGAINST BLIND RELIANCE ON MARXISM-LENINISM
-MAO TSE-TUNG THOUGHT AND HAS CALLED FOR &quot;SEEKING TRUTH
CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL
PAGE 06

STATE 256102

FROM FACTS,&quot; HUA HAS CONTINUED TO EMPHASIZE THE IMPORTANCE
OF IDEOLOGICAL RECTITUDE AND THE CORRECTNESS OF THE CULTURAL REVOLUTION POLICIES BASED ON EGALITARIANISM. THOUGH
SHARING THE BELIEF THAT THE DESTRUCTIVE POLICIES OF THE
CULTURAL REVOLUTION ERA MUST BE REPLACED WITH MEASURES
RESTORING DISCIPLINE AND ECONOMIC GROWTH, HUA AND OTHERS
APPEAR TO BE CONCERNED THAT TENG AND HIS FOLLOWERS ARE

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
PUSHING THE PRC TOO FAST IN SEEKING TO EFFECT THESE GOALS.
15. IT IS LIKELY THAT EDUCATIONAL POLICY ALSO STIMULATED
A LIVELY DEBATE REVOLVING AROUND SUCH ISSUES AS: THE
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN COMMUNISM'S EGALITARIAN PROMISE
AND ELITISM IN THE SERVICE OF RAPID MODERNIZATION; HOW TO
PREVENT THE EMERGENCE OF A BUREAUCRATIC AND INTELLECTUAL
&quot;NEW CLASS;&quot; AND HOW TO COPE WITH THE HUGE NUMBER OF DISADVANTAGED YOUTH WHO FEEL THEIR PATH HAS NOW BEEN CLOSED
BY THE NEW ELITIST POLICIES.
,6. THERE ALSO APPEARS TO BE CONSIDERABLE DEBATE ABOUT
SUCH MILITARY RELATED ISSUES AS POLITICAL CONTROL OVER
THE PLA, THE CONTINUED RELEVANCE OF THE &quot;PEOPLES WAR&quot;
CONCEPT IN A TECHNOLOGICAL AGE, AND THE STRATEGIC IMPORTANCE OF THE MILITIA.
17. BEYOND THE DEBATE AT THE CENTER, MANY PROVINCIAL
AND LOCAL PARTY OFFICIALS AND CADRES CONTINUE TO OPPOSE
PASSIVELY THE IMPLEMENTATION OF SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC
REFORMS. WHILE SOME OF THIS OPPOSITION APPEARS TO BE
BASED ON GENUINE CONVICTION, MUCH OF IT IS PROBABLY FOOTDRAGGING,STEMMING FROM A FEAR OF BEING CAUGHT ONCE AGAIN
IN A RADICAL BACKLASH. HALF OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY'S
THIRTY-FIVE MILLION MEMBERS JOINED AFTER THE BEGINNING OF
THE CULTURAL REVOLUTION AND SEVEN MILLION SINCE THE 10TH

PARTY CONGRESS IN 1973, THE TWO PERIODS OF GREATEST RADICAL STRENGTH. MANY OF THESE PEOPLE MUST FEEL THREATENED
BY THE ANTI-CULTURAL REVOLUTION DRIVE. FURTHER, THE
CENTRAL LEADERSHIP HAS MADE IT CLEAR THAT IT INTENDS TO
RELY ON VETERAN CADRES, WHO ARE OFTEN CULTURAL REVOLUTION
REHABILITEES, TO CARRY OUT ITS POLICIES. AS A RESULT,
YOUNGER OFFICIALS PROBABLY SEE LITTLE OPPORTUNITY FOR
CAREER ADVANCEMENT AND COULD, IN TIME, BECOME DISAFFECTED.
18. HUA'S ROLE. IT SEEMS CLEAR THAT HUA-KUO-FENG WOULD
PREFER TO REMAIN ALOOF FROM THE BATTLE AS A SYMBOL OF
UNITY. HIS ROLE HAS, THEREFORE, BEEN AMBIVALENT. AS
MAO'S PRINCIPAL LEGATEE, AND AS A PROMINENT BENEFICIARY
OF THE CULTURAL REVOLUTION, AND ONE CLOSELY ASSOCIATED
WITH MANY OF THE OTHER CENTRAL LEADERS WHO HAVE SOMETIMES
BEEN SEEN AS BEING IN OPPOSITION TO TENG, HUA MAY HAVE
FOUND IT UNAVOIDABLE ON OCCASION TO ACT AS SPOKESMAN
FOR THE OPPOSITION. AT THE SAME TIME HIS SPEECH TO THE
JULY FINANCE AND TRADE CONFERENCE INDICATES THAT HE HAS
ALSO PROVIDED IMPORTANT SUPPORT FOR TENG'S POLICIES.
19. THIS PROBABLY REFLECTS THE FACT THAT, DESPITE AN

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
IMPRESSIVE ARRAY OF TITLES (CHAIRMAN OF THE PARTY, PREMIER
AND COMMANDER IN CHIEF OF THE ARMY), HUA SIMPLY DOES NOT
HAVE THE POWER BASE TO CHALLENGE TENG EFFECTIVELY.
FURTHER, AS A JUNIOR MEMBER OF THE GERONTOCRACY, HUA (56)
DOES NOT NEED TO HURRY. HE HAS, THEREFORE, ADOPTED A
POLICY WHICH STRESSES UNITY IN AN EFFORT TO PRESERVE THE
PRESENT EQUILIBRIUM, WHILE CAUTIOUSLY ATTEMPTING TO PROTECT SOME OF HIS KEY ASSOCIATES WHO WERE TAINTED BY THE
CULTURAL REVOLUTION.
20. THE FUTURE. TENG HSIAO-PING IS AN IMPATIENT MAN
BY NATURE AND HE KNOWS HIS EFFECTIVE WORKING YEARS ARE
LIMITED. ON THE BASIS OF RESULTS SO FAR, HE SHOULD BE
PLEASED. HIS POLICIES ARE PREVAILING AND HIS ALLIES

NOW OCCUPY MANY KEY POSITIONS THROUGHOUT THE STATE, MILITARY AND PARTY APPARATUS.
21. THE DANGER FOR TENG LIES IN THE HASTE WITH WHICH HE
HAS MOVED IN ATTACKING FORMERLY SACROSANCT MAOIST IDEALS.
THERE HAVE BEEN PAST PERIODS OF REFORM AND TURNING TO
THE OUTSIDE WORLD IN CHINESE HISTORY, BUT THE XENOPHOBIC
&quot;BOXER&quot; TENDENCY RUNS DEEP IN CHINESE SOCIETY. THERE ARE
MANY WHOSE VESTED INTERESTS AND DEEPLY HELD BELIEFS ARE
BEING CHALLENGED BY THE RAPID DEPARTURE FROM THE PRINCIPLES OF THE OLD REGIME. AT PRESENT, THESE INDIVIDUALS
ARE BEING HELD IN CHECK BY THE POPULAR REVULSION AGAINST
THE EXCESSES OF THE CULTURAL REVOLUTION.
22. IF TENG'S ECONOMIC REFORMS BEGIN TO SHOW AN ECONOMIC
PAYOFF, HOWEVER, THEY SHOULD DEVELOP A MOMENTUM OF THEIR
OWN WHICH ANY ONE POLITICAL FIGURE WOULD FIND DIFFICULT
TO CHALLENGE. ON THE OTHER HAND, ECONOMIC SETBACKS,
PARTICULARLY IN THE CRITICAL AGRICULTURAL AREA, COULD
SEVERELY UNDERCUT TENG'S MODERNIZATION STRATEGY.
23. THE SUDDEN DEATH OF ANYONE OF THE KEY ACTORS - HUA,
TENG OR YEH CHIEN-YING - COULD UPSET THE PRESENT EQUILIBRIUM. TENG IN PARTICULAR SEEMS AWARE OF THIS, AND
PART OF HIS STRATEGY IN DESANCTIFYING MAO SEEMS TO BE
A DESIRE TO DEPRIVE HIS POTENTIAL SUCCESSORS OF IDEOLOGICAL UNDERPINNINGS FOR A SWING AWAY FROM HIS MODERATE
POLICIES AND TO SET CHINA ON A MODERNIZING PATH THAT
WILL OUTLIVE HIM.

TO AN ABRUPT HALT IN THE CHAOS OF THE CULTURAL REVOLUCONFIDENTIAL

TION. TENG IS TRYING TO STUFF THAT PARTICULAR GENIE
BACK IN THE BOTTLE; HIS SUCCESS OR FAILURE WILL DETERMINE
WHETHER THE CURRENT DRIVE TURNS INTO A LONG-TERM COMMITMENT.
B. THE ECONOMY
25. THE GOALS. THE POST-MAO LEADERSHIP HAS MADE CHOU
EN-LAI'S VISIONARY CALL FOR THE TRANSFORMATION OF CHINA
INTO A MODERN, POWERFUL, SOCIALIST STATE BY THE YEAR
2000 INTO ITS RAISON D'ETRE. ACHIEVING THIS OBJECTIVE
IS A FORMIDABLE TASK. PARTIALLY AS A RESULT OF THE LACK
OF MATERIAL INCENTIVES, LABOR PRODUCTIVITY IS VERY LOW.
KEY SECTORS SUCH AS COAL, TRANSPORTATION, AND ELECTRIC
POWER HAVE SUFFERED THROUGH PAST NEGLECT AND ARE BOTTLENECKS TO RAPID FUTURE GROWTH. FUTURE AGRICULTURAL PROGRESS
IS LIKELY TO REQUIRE HEAVY CAPITAL INVESTMENT.
, ; E TARGETS AND GOALS FOR THE NEXT EIGHT YEARS,
AS REVEALED AT THE FIFTH NATIONAL PEOPLES CONGRESS (NPC)
HELD EARLIER THIS YEAR, ARE AMBITIOUS AND INCLUDE:
ACHIEVEMENT OF 85 PER CENT MECHANIZATION OF AGRICULTURE,
WITH AGRICULTURAL OUTPUT TO INCREASE BY 4-5 PER CENT
EACH YEAR AND GRAIN PRODUCTION TO REACH 400 MMT ANNUALLY
BY THE END OF THE PERIOD (COMPARED WITH 280 MMT FOR 1977);
EXPANSION OF INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION AT AN ANNUAL RATE OF
10 PER CENT, WITH STEEL PRODUCTION MORE THAN DOUBLING
BY 1985; CONSOLIDATION OF THE ECONOMY THROUGH THE COMPLETION OF 120 LARGE INDUSTRIAL COMPLEXES AND THE ORGANIZATION OF'14 INDUSTRIAL BASES&quot; AND &quot;SIX ECONOMIC REGIONS;&quot;
A STRENGTHENING OF THE VERTICAL MANAGEMENT OF THE ECONOMY WITH GREATER CONTROL RETURNING TO THE CENTRAL AUTHORITIES; AND REDUCTION OF THE POPULATION INCREASE FROM THE
CURRENT ESTIMATED ANNUAL RATE OF 1.6 PER CENT TO LESS
THAN 1 PER CENT BY 1980.

27. THE MEANS. DISCIPLINE, ORGANIZATION, BUREAUCRATIC
CONTROL, AND FOREIGN TECHNOLOGY ARE THE KEY ELEMENTS
BY WHICH THE TENG INSPIRED LEADERSHIP HOPES TO ACHIEVE
ITS GOALS. THE LEADERSHIP PLANS TO REALIZE MAJOR SAVINGS
THROUGH BETTER ADMINISTRATION--IMPROVING THE PLANNING
APPARATUS, REDUCING CORRUPTION AND WASTE, TIGHTENING

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
COST-ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL PROCEDURES, VIGOROUSLY
INSTITUTING A SYSTEM OF ONE-MAN RESPONSIBILITY, REPLACING
&quot;REVOLUTIONARY COMMITTEES&quot; WITH MORE EFFICIENT MANAGEMENT
STRUCTURES, AND STRESSING HARD WORK FOR CIVIL SERVANTS,
FACTORY MANAGEMENT, AND ORDINARY WORKERS. INVESTMENT,
TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, WILL BE CHANNELED INTO PRIORITY
SECTORS SUCH AS AGRICULTURE, POWER, FUEL, RAW AND SEMIFINISHED MATERIALS, AND TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS.
MATERIAL INCENTIVES WILL BE UPGRADED TO URGE INDUSTRIAL
WORKERS TO GREATER EFFORTS. IN THIS REGARD ABOUT HALF
OF CHINA'S INDUSTRIAL WORK FORCE RECEIVED A MODEST PAY
INCREASE LAST YEAR AND VARIOUS FORMS OF BONUSES, PIECEWORK REMUNERATION, AND OTHER SCHEMES TO PEG INCOME DIRECTLY TO OUTPUT HAVE BEEN OFFICIALLY SANCTIONED. SOME HAVE
ALREADY BEEN INTRODUCED IN A NUMBER OF INDUSTRIAL PLANTS.
PEASANTS ARE BEING PROMISED BETTER TERMS OF TRADE FOR
THEIR PRODUCTS AT THE SAME TIME THAT THEY ARE BEING EXHORTED TO INCREASE THEIR CONTRIBUTION TO &quot;BASIC CAPITAL
CONSTRUCTION&quot;--I.E., OFF-SEASON EFFORTS TO RECLAIM WASTELAND, CONSTRUCT IRRIGATION PROJECTS, LEVEL FIELDS, TERRACE HILLSIDES, ETC. STATE INVESTMENT WILL BE INCREASED
IN ORDER TO HASTEN MECHANIZATION AND FUND LARGE-SCALE
WATER CONTROL PROJECTS. FINALLY, A RELAXATION OF CHINA'S
TRADITIONAL POLICY OF &quot;SELF-RELIANCE&quot; IS INTENDED TO OBTAIN ACCESS TO WESTERN TECHNOLOGY AND FINANCE.
CONFIDENTIAL

PAGE 11

STATE 256102

28. THIS IS A TOUGH MINDED, SOLID PROGRAM BUT IT WILL
NOT BE EASY TO INSTITUTE. MILITARY MODERNIZATION AND
GRAIN IMPORTS WILL BE AMONG THE IMPORTANT SECTORS COMPETING FOR INVESTMENT WITH THE PRIORITY SECTORS OF THE
ECONOMY. INTRODUCING LABOR DISCIPLINE IN FACTORIES WHERE
THE WORKERS HAVE FOR YEARS BEEN TOLD TO &quot;STRUGGLE&quot; AGAINST
SUCH CAPITALISTIC PRACTICES WILL REQUIRE MORE THAN EXHORTATION. THE EFFECT OF LAST YEAR'S PAY RISE WILL BE RAPIDLY LOST IF FURTHER WAGE REFORM IS NOT SOON INSTITUTED.
FINALLY, ALLOWING FOREIGN TECHNOLOGY AND FOREIGN TECHNICIANS INTO CHINA WILL PRESENT NOT ONLY IDEOLOGICAL PROBLEMS BUT REAL PRACTICAL PROBLEMS INVOLVING THE COMPATIBILITY OF EXISTING CHINESE TECHNOLOGIES AND THE CHINESE
PEOPLE.
29. INDUSTRIAL PERFORMANCE. IN MANY RESPECTS THE PRC
INDUSTRIAL SECTOR IS ENJOYING THE MOST FAVORABLE CONDITIONS IT HAS KNOWN IN YEARS. THIS IS PARTICULARLY TRUE
WITH RESPECT TO THE POLICY ENVIRONMENT. A NEW CODIFICATION OF INDUSTRIAL POLICY CALLED THE &quot;30 POINTS&quot; SHOULD
SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE PRODUCTION AND EFFICIENCY IN THE

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
LONG RUN. THE HIGHER LEVELS OF ECONOMIC MANAGEMENT HAVE
BEEN STAFFED WITH EXPERIENCED CADRES. IMPROVED CENTRAL
CONTROL HAS BEEN MATCHED WITH A DECISION TO RETAIN LOCAL
ADMINISTRATION.
30. INFORMED OBSERVERS BELIEVE THAT THE GROS VALUE OF
INDUSTRIAL OUTPUT (GVIO) IN THE FIRST HALF OF 1978 ACHIEVED A NEW HALF YEAR RECORD AND A SUBSTANTIAL--15 PER CENT-GROWTH FOR ALL OF 1978 IS QUITE LIKELY. (IT SHOULD BE
REMEMBERED,HOWEVER,THAT 1977 WAS A RELATIVELY POOR YEAR.)
THE FOLLOWING IS A COMPARISON OF 1977 AND 1978 FIRST HALF
PRODUCTION RESULTS FOR SEVERAL KEY INDUSTRIES:
A. NEW CHINA NEWS AGENCY (NCNA) HAS CLAIMED THAT CRUDE
OIL PRODUCTION IS UP SOME 11.2 PER CENT, AND PROCESSING
CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL
PAGE 12

STATE 256102

IS UP 8.1 PER CENT. PETROLEUM PRODUCTION MAY BE DEVELOPING INTO A MEDIUM TERM BOTTLENECK. THERE ARE INDICATIONS
THAT GROWTH RATES IN PRODUCTION ARE LEVELING OFF OR EVEN
DECLINING, ALTHOUGH THIS MAY REFLECT CONSERVATION EFFORTS
BY THE CHINESE.
B. COAL OUTPUT ACCORDING TO NCNA IS UP 19.3 PER CENT.
THIS CREDITABLE PERFORMANCE PROBABLY REFLECTS SUCCESSES
IN RAISING WORKER PRODUCTIVITY AND IN IMPROVED EMPLOYMENT
OF EXISTING CAPITAL PLANT AFTER TWO BAD YEARS FOLLOWING
THE TANGSHAN EARTHQUAKE.
C. ELECTRIC OUTPUT ACCORDING TO NCNA INCREASED TO 17.7
PER CENT. MEDIA REPORTS, HOWEVER, CONTINUE TO INDICATE
THAT ELECTRIC SUPPLY IS STILL LESS THAN DEMAND. THE
PRESENT TRENDS,HOWEVER, SUGGESTS THAT THE ELECTRICITY
BOTTLENECK WILL NOT GROW SUBSTANTIALLY WORSE THIS YEAR.
D. STEEL PRODUCTION ACCORDING TO NCNA IS UP 66.9 PER
CENT. IT IS STILL FAR BELOW REQUIREMENTS, HOWEVER, AND
IMPORTS ARE AT RECORD LEVELS. THE CHINESE HAVE ADMITTED
THAT RECOVERY TO THE 1975 LEVEL OF PRODUCTION WILL NOT
BE REALIZED UNTIL NEXT YEAR.
E. CHEMICAL FERTILIZER IS REPORTED TO BE UP 47 PER CENT,
AND THE OUTLOOK IS FOR CONTINUED HIGH GROWTH.
F. LIGHT INDUSTRY PRODUCTION IS UP 20 PER CENT. 1977
WAS, HOWEVER, A BAD YEAR FOR THIS INDUSTRY, SO THE FIGURES
SUGGEST NORMAL, RATHER THAN EXCEPTIONAL, GROWTH.
G. RAIL-FREIGHT VOLUME GREW AT 22.4 PER CENT. DESPITE

STATE 256102

THE IMPROVEMENT, HOWEVER, RAILROADS STILL CONSTITUTE
A BOTTLENECK.
H. NCNA CLAIMED AN INCREASE OF 65.3 PER CENT IN PROFITS
REMITTED TO THE STATE, AN IMPRESSIVE FIGURE WHICH SUGGESTS
IMPROVEMENTS IN LABOR PRODUCTIVITY, BETTER ACCOUNTING,
MATERIALS MANAGEMENT, AND PERHAPS MOST IMPORTANT, IMPROVED USE OF CAPACITY.
31. AGRICULTURAL PERFORMANCE. TENTATIVE ESTIMATES ARE
THAT CHINA MAY ATTAIN AN 8 MILLION METRIC TON (2.9 PER
CENT) TO 13 MMT (4.6 PER CENT) INCREASE IN GRAIN PRODUCTION THIS YEAR. THIS INCREASE IS FAR SHORT OF EARLIER
OFFICIAL PLANNING. WHEAT IMPORTS, WHICH IN THE 1977/78
MARKETING YEAR (JULY/JUNE) TOTALED 8.5 MMT, ARE LIKELY
TO TOTAL AT LEAST 8.0 MMT FOR THE 1978/79 MARKETING
YEAR AND CONTINUE TO CONSTITUTE AN IMPORTANT DRAIN ON
FOREIGN EXCHANGE.
32. COTTON PRODUCTION HAS BEEN DISAPPOINTING FOR SEVERAL
YEARS AND LITTLE IMPROVEMENT IS EXPECTED THIS YEAR. IMPORTS ARE EXPECTED TO AT LEAST EQUAL THE 2 MILLION BALES
IMPORTED IN 1977/78.
33. EDIBLE OILS ARE IN SOMEWHAT BETTER SHAPE DUE TO A
40 PER CENT INCREASE IN THE PRODUCTION OF RAPESEED,
WHICH ACCOUNTS FOR APPROXIMATELY ONE THIRD OF CHINA'S
TOTAL EDIBLE OIL OUTPUT. STILL, ACCORDING TO CHINESE
SOURCES, PER CAPITA CONSUMPTION OF EDIBLE OILS IS ONLY
ABOUT 5.9 OUNCES PER MONTH, AND FOR THE SHORT TO MEDIUM
TERM THERE IS LITTLE PROSPECT FOR ANY IMPROVEMENT IN THIS
AUSTERE RATION.
34. SHORTFALLS IN AGRICULTURAL OUTPUT, WHETHER BECAUSE
OF WEATHER CONDITIONS OR POLICY PROBLEMS, CONTINUE TO BE
ONE OF THE MOST SERIOUS THREATS TO CHINA'S MODERNIZATION
CONFIDENTIAL

PLANS.
35. FOREIGN ECONOMIC POLICY. IN THE LAST TWO YEARS THE
PRC GOVERNMENT HAS GIVEN ALMOST UNPRECEDENTED ATTENTION
TO THE PIVOTAL ROLES OF FOREIGN TRADE AND TECHNOLOGY IN
AN EFFORT TO TRANSFORM CHINA'S ECONOMY. THE LEADERSHIP
HAS ENCOURAGED A MORE INNOVATIVE AND AGGRESSIVE APPROACH

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
TO WORLD TRADE AND HAS BEGUN TO IMPLEMENT NEW AND MORE
LIBERAL TRADE AND EXTERNAL FINANCIAL POLICIES. EXPORT
CONTRACTS HAVE BEEN CHARACTERIZED, FOR EXAMPLE, BY GREATER
CHINESE RESPONSIVENESS TO FOREIGN BUYERS' NEEDS, FLEXIBILITY IN PRICING, AND THE INCLUSION OF INTERNATIONAL
STANDARDS ON PATENTS, TRADEMARKS, AND COPYRIGHTS. THE PRC
HAS SIGNED AGREEMENTS WITH SEVERAL WESTERN COUNTRIES
DESIGNED TO FACILITATE TRADE AND IS CONSIDERING A WIDE
VARIETY OF LOAN ARRANGEMENTS WITH FOREIGN BANKS, THUS
DEPARTING FROM ITS FORMER PRACTICE OF RELYING SOLELY ON
SUPPLIERS' CREDITS TO FINANCE MAJOR CAPITAL PURCHASES.
36. THESE CHANGES ALONE, HOWEVER, WILL NOT BE ENOUGH
TO BRING ABOUT THE TECHNOLOGICAL PROGRESS THAT CHINA
NEEDS TO ACHIEVE ITS ECONOMIC GOALS. FURTHER MODIFICATIONS IN ALMOST ALL OF ITS FOREIGN ECONOMIC PRACTICES
ARE THUS UNDER CONSIDERATION AND, IN MANY CASES, WILL BE
ADOPTED. IN PARTICULAR, THE LEADERSHIP APPEARS CONVINCED
THAT RELAXATION OF CHINA'S TRADITIONAL POLICY OF &quot;SELFRELIANCE&quot; WOULD HELP EASE FINANCIAL CONSTRAINTS AND IMPROVE CHINA'S LIMITED ABILITY TO ABSORB WESTERN TECHNOLOGY.
37. DESPITE PEKING'S INCREASED FLEXIBILITY IN FOREIGN
ECONOMIC POLICY, FOREIGN OWNERSHIP REMAINS A VERY SENSITIVE ISSUE. THERE ARE INDICATIONS THAT PEKING WILL
ATTEMPT TO CHANNEL FOREIGN TECHNOLOGY INTO CHINA THROUGH
CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL
PAGE 15

STATE 256102

A MECHANISM OF &quot;JOINT STOCK COMPANIES&quot; IN HONG KONG AND
MACAO. A VARIETY OF BUSINESS AND TRADE RELATIONS MAY BE
TESTED IN THESE TWO AREAS RATHER THAN ON THE CHINESE MAINLAND-ITSELF. IN ANY CASE THERE CLEARLY ARE LIMITS TO
LIBERALIZATION, WHICH WILL BE TESTED AS THE NEW POLICIES
EVOLVE.
38. SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY. FACED WITH AN ACUTE SHORTAGE
OF SCIENTISTS AND TECHNICIANS, PARTLY OWING TO THE EXCESSES OF THE CULTURAL REVOLUTION, PEKING HAS PAID UNPRECEDENTED ATTENTION TO SCIENCE AND TO SCIENTISTS, IN RECENT
MONTHS. AMONG THE REFORMS WHICH HAVE BEEN OR ARE ABOUT
TO BE ADOPTED ARE: STRENGTHENING AND RECENTRALIZING
CHINA'S SCIENCE MANAGEMENT APPARATUS BY REVIVING LEADING
ADMINISTRATIVE ORGANIZATIONS AND RESEARCH INSTITUTES AND
INCREASING THE AUTHORITY OF SCIENTISTS; GIVING INTELLECTUALS BETTER TREATMENT BY REVERSING PAST NEGATIVE JUDGMENTS
AGAINST THEM, IMPROVING WORKING CONDITIONS, AND INCREASING
MATERIAL BENEFITS; STRESSING ACADEMIC STANDARDS IN ENTRANCE EXAMS AND COLLEGE CURRICULA; MAKING GREATER USE OF
FOREIGN EXPERTS, TECHNOLOGY, AND EQUIPMENT; AND DISPATCH-

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
ING THOUSANDS OF STUDENTS TO WESTERN COUNTRIES FOR COLLEGE, GRADUATE AND POST-GRADUATE TRAINING, PRIMARILY IN THE
SCIENCES.
39. THE FUTURE. AMBITIOUS AS CHINA'S MODERNIZATION GOALS
ARE, THEY CAN BE ACCOMPLISHED ONLY IF POLITICAL TURMOIL
CAN BE AVOIDED, IF SUCCESSIVE YEARS OF FAVORABLE AGRICULTURE WEATHER PREVAIL, AND IF CENTRALIZED PLANNING AND
CONTROL ARE NOT ALLOWED TO BE OVERLY OBTRUSIVE.
40. IT IS INTERESTING TO SPECULATE WHAT EFFECT SUCCESSFUL MODERNIZATION BY CHINA WOULD HAVE ON THE REST OF THE
WORLD. A 10 PER CENT ANNUAL GROWTH RATE DOUBLES REAL GNP
IN 7 YEARS, QUADRUPLES IT IN 14 YEARS, AND MULTIPLIES
CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL
PAGE 16

STATE 256102

IT BY 16 IN 28 YEARS. IF CHINA IS ABLE TO ACHIEVE A
SUSTAINED 10 PER CENT GROWTH RATE, CHINA WOULD ACHIEVE
JAPAN'S 1978 PER CAPITA GNP BY THE EARLY 21ST CENTURY.
FOR APPROXIMATELY 1 BILLION CHINESE THIS WOULD MEAN AN
ANNUAL GNP OF 5 TRILLION DOLLARS. THE PROSPECT OF 1
BILLION CHINESE CONSUMING ENERGY AND OTHER RESOURCES
AT APPROXIMATELY THE PER CAPITA RATE 100 MILLION JAPANESE
DO TODAY WILL PRESENT THE WORLD WITH UNPRECEDENTED PROBLEMS OF ACCOMMODATION.
C. FOREIGN AFFAIRS
41. THE OBJECTIVES OF CHINESE FOREIGN POLICY HAVE REMAINED CONSTANT OVER THE PAST HALF-YEAR, BUT PEKING HAS
PURSUED THESE GOALS WITH A NEW DYNAMISM AND PRAGMATISM.
STRENGTHENING CHINA'S SECURITY THROUGH A WORLD-WIDE ANTISOVIET CAMPAIGN CONTINUES TO RECEIVE TOP PRIORITY, CLOSELY FOLLOWED BY EFFORTS TO SPEED UP CHINA'S MODERNIZATION
THROUGH EXPANDED CONTACTS WITH JAPAN AND THE WEST. IN
TURN, BOTH OF THESE GOALS SERVE ANOTHER, THAT OF ACHIEVING
FOR CHINA ITS RIGHTFUL PLACE AS AN IMPORTANT ACTOR ON
THE WORLD STAGE.
42. A KEY FEATURE OF THIS VIGOROUS REAFFIRMATION OF WHAT
BEGAN IN THE EARLY SEVENTIES AS THE MAO-CHOU &quot;REVOLUTIONARY LINE IN FOREIGN POLICY&quot; HAS BEEN THE APPEARANCE OF
SENIOR CHINESE LEADERS ON VIRTUALLY EVERY CONTINENT.
MOST SPECTACULAR WAS CHAIRMAN HUA'S TRIUMPHANT FIRST
FORAY OUT OF ASIA, TO ROMANIA, YUGOSLAVIA AND IRAN.
43. THE MOST SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN TACTICS HAS BEEN
PEKING'S DECISION TO DEEMPHASIZE SELF-RELIANCE IN PURSUING

STATE 256102

THE LONG-STANDING GOAL OF MODERNIZATION. CHINESE DELEGATIONS INTERESTED IN STUDYING OR PURCHASING WESTERN PRODUCTS AND TECHNOLOGY HAVE POURED FORTH FROM PEKING, AND
A LARGE NUMBER OF SIMILAR FOREIGN DELEGATIONS HAVE VISITED
THE PRC. PEKING IS ALSO PLANNING TO SEND THOUSANDS OF
STUDENTS AT ALL LEVELS TO WESTERN COUNTRIES FOR EDUCATION
AND TRAINING. FINALLY, CHINA IS SERIOUSLY CONSIDERING
VARIOUS SCHEMES WHICH WOULD INVOLVE FOREIGNERS MUCH MORE
DIRECTLY IN CHINA'S ECONOMIC LIFE--INCLUDING BORROWING
FROM FOREIGN BANKS, PRODUCT COMPENSATION AGREEMENTS AND,
IN HONG KONG, EVEN JOINT STOCK VENTURES.
44. THIS SURGE IN ACTIVITY IS ALMOST CERTAINLY THE WORK
OF VICE-PREMIER TENG HSIAO-P'ING, AND INDICATES THAT HE
HAS ENOUGH SUPPORT WITHIN THE LEADERSHIP COALITION TO
IMPLEMENT THESE POLICIES. THERE IS PROBABLY FULL AGREEMENT ON OPPOSITION TO THE SOVIETS AND ON ENHANCING CHINA'S
GLOBAL PRESTIGE. ON THE OTHER HAND, THERE IS A DEEP
SUSPICION OF FOREIGN TIES THAT IS FIRMLY ROOTED IN CHINESE
HISTORY. THEREFORE, A REDUCTION IN THE INFLUENCE OF TENG
AND HIS SUPPORTERS COULD PRECIPITATE A RETURN TO A LESS
PRAGMATIC,MORE XENOPHOBIC LINE, ESPECIALLY CONCERNING
THE ECONOMIC ASPECTS OF THIS NEW APPROACH IN FOREIGN
POLICY.
45. THE OPEN BREAKS WITH ALBANIA AND VIETNAM (SEE BELOW
FOR DETAILS) DO NOT FIT NEATLY WITH THE DOMINANT THEMES
SKETCHED ABOVE. IN BOTH CASES PEKING DECIDED TO CLOSE
OPTIONS, ALMOST CERTAINLY FOR MANY YEARS TO COME, INSTEAD
OF EMPHASIZING COMMON INTERESTS AND DOWNPLAYING INCOMPATABILITIES. THIS STYLE, GENERALLY FLEXIBLE BUT DECISIVELY
RUTHLESS WHEN NECESSARY, AGAIN FURTHER SUGGESTS TENG'S
INFLUENCE IN FOREIGN POLICY.
46. USSR AND EASTERN EUROPE. SINO-SOVIET RELATIONS CONTINUE TO BE SEVERELY STRAINED. PEKING BELIEVES THAT MOSCONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL
PAGE 18

STATE 256102

COW POSES THE CHIEF THREAT TO ITS SECURITY AND THAT ANY
FLINCHING BY CHINA WILL BE EXPLOITED BY THE SOVIETS AS
A SIGN OF WEAKNESS. ALSO, IT IS PROBABLE THAT THE CURRENT
LEADERSHIP FINDS THIS THREAT A CONVENIENT ADDITIONAL
RATIONALE FOR CHINA'S RAPID MODERNIZATION. PEKING'S
HARD-NOSED ATTITUDE WAS EVIDENT IN ITS REJECTION OF MOSCOW'S OFFER, JUST PRIOR TO THE NPC IN FEBRUARY, TO NEGO-

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
TIATE GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF MUTUAL RELATIONS. CHINESE
LEADERS USED THIS OCCASION TO HARDEN THE CHINESE POSITION
BY STIPULATING THAT &quot;NORMALIZATION&quot; OF SINO-SOVIET
RELATIONS WAS DEPENDENT ON THE WITHDRAWAL OF SOVIET
TROOPS FROM MONGOLIA AND A DRAWDOWN OF SOVIET TROOP
STRENGTH ALONG THE BORDER TO THE LEVELS OF THE EARLY 60S.
THIS STIFFNESS WAS ALSO REFLECTED IN PEKING'S PUBLIC
CHASTISEMENT OF MOSCOW IN MAY FOR WHAT WAS ALMOST CERTAINLY AN INADVERTENT BORDER INCIDENT. FINALLY, ALTHOUGH
THE BORDER TALKS WERE RESUMED FOR TWO MONTHS (MAY-JUNE),
THEY WERE AGAIN SUSPENDED WHEN NO PROGRESS WAS MADE.
47. CHAIRMAN HUA'S TRIP TO ROMANIA AND YUGOSLAVIA DREW
ATTENTION TO CHINA'S CURRENT POLICY TOWARD EASTERN EUROPE
AND THE DEGREE TO WHICH IT HAS BEEN SUCESSFUL. PEKING'S
CHIEF INTEREST IN TIES WITH ROMANIA AND YUGOSLAVIA IS TO
SUPPORT INDEPENDENCE FROM MOSCOW AND ENCOURAGE OTHER
EASTERN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES TO CONSIDER SIMILAR STANCES.
IN ADDITION, HOWEVER, ECONOMIC AND TECHNICAL EXCHANGES
WILL HELP CHINA MODERNIZE AND PEKING APPEARS VERY INTERESTED IN YUGOSLAVIA'S ECONOMIC SYSTEM AS A POSSIBLE MODEL
FROM WHICH CHINA COULD BORROW.
48. ON THE OTHER HAND, OTHER EASTERN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES
HAVE ECHOED MOSCOW'S DIRECT ATTACKS ON CHINA FOR &quot;STIRRING
CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL
PAGE 19

STATE 256102

UP TROUBLE&quot; THROUGH HUA'S VISIT. THIS SUGGESTS THAT THE
VERY SUCCESS OF HUA'S TRIP TO BELGRADE AND BUCHAREST
MAY IN FACT DISCOURAGE OTHER CAPITALS FROM FOLLOWING SUIT.
ALBANIA, TOO, WEIGHED IN WITH BITTER CRITICISM OF HUA'S
TRIP, ALTHOUGH THERE IS NO SIGN THAT IT WILL ALTER ITS
EQUALLY HARSH VIEW OF THE USSR. CHINA'S GROWING FRIENDSHIP WITH TIRANA'S ARCH-ENEMY, TITO, WAS ONE FACTOR WHICH
LED TO PEKING'S ANNOUNCEMENT ON JULY 7 THAT IT WAS TERMINATING ALL AID TO ALBANIA. HOWEVER, THE KEY ISSUES FOR
PEKING APPARENTLY WERE ALBANIA'S PUBLIC CRITICISM OF
PEKING'S WILLINGNESS TO ENLIST THE WEST, AND PARTICULARLY
THE US, IN ITS &quot;UNITED FRONT&quot; AGAINST THE SOVIETS AND THE
PERCEPTION THAT TIRANA WAS UNGRATEFUL FOR CHINA'S CONSIDERABLE AID OVER THE PAST TWO DECADES.
49. JAPAN. CHINA'S RELATIONS WITH JAPAN ARE FLOURISHING.
THE PROCESS OF NORMALIZATION, BEGUN IN 1972, WAS COMPLETED
IN AUGUST WITH THE SIGNING OF THE LONG-STALLED PEACE AND
FRIENDSHIP TREATY. IN THE NEGOTIATIONS PEKING CONCEDED
SUFFICIENT POINTS TO ACHIEVE A MAJOR GOAL, THE INCLUSION
OF AN &quot;ANTI-HEGEMONY&quot; CLAUSE CLEARLY, IF NOT EXPLICITLY,
AIMED AT THE SOVIETS. THE PFT FOLLOWED ON THE HEELS OF

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
THE 20 BILLION DOLLARS TRADE AGREEMENT SIGNED LAST FEBRUTHE 20 BILLION DOLLARS TRADE AGREEMENT SIGNED LAST FEBRUARY AND RECENTLY EXTENDED FOR ANOTHER FIVE YEARS. IN
ADDITION TO THESE POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC LINKS, WHICH
ARE THE CLOSEST PEKING HAS WITH ANY COUNTRY, VISITS BY
ACTIVE DUTY MILITARY PERSONNEL HAVE BEGUN. THESE MAY
BE DESIGNED PRIMARILY AS A WARNING TO MOSCOW, SINCE PEKING
WILL PROBABLY LOOK TO THE MORE DEVELOPED MUNITIONS INDUSTRIES OF EUROPE FOR WEAPONS AND TECHNOLOGY.
50. TWO ISSUES DO REMAIN, HOWEVER, BETWEEN PEKING AND
TOKYO: SOVEREIGNTY OVER THE SENKAKU ISLANDS AND THE
JAPAN-KOREA JOINT DEVELOPMENT ZONE IN THE EAST CHINA SEA.
CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL
PAGE 20

STATE 256102

THE JAPANESE HAVE OFFICIALLY ACCEPTED THE REPEATED
CHINESE EXPLANATION THAT LAST APRIL'S CURIOUS INCIDENT
IN THE SENKAKUS WAS &quot;ACCIDENTAL,&quot; BUT THE PUZZLE REMAINS.
PEKING HAS NEVER RECOGNIZED THE RIGHT OF JAPAN AND KOREA
TO ESTABLISH A JOINT DEVELOPMENT ZONE WITHOUT CONSULTING
THE PRC. DESPITE THE POTENTIAL FOR TROUBLE THESE TWO
ISSUES POSE, HOWEVER, IT IS UNLIKELY THAT EITHER SIDE IS
INTERESTED IN DRAGGING THEM OUT IN THE NEAR FUTURE.
51. UNITED STATES. AN IMPORTANT INDICATION OF THE PRAGMATISM OF CHINESE FOREIGN POLICY HAS BEEN PEKING'S WILLING
NESS, EVEN EAGERNESS, TO BROADEN CONTACTS WITH THE US
PRIOR TO NORMALIZATION, AND DESPITE CONTINUED, IF MUTED,
ASSIGNMENT OF A VILLAIN'S ROLE TO THE US IN CHINA'S &quot;THREE
WORLD'S THEORY.&quot; CHAIRMAN HUA'S CONSPICUOUS MENTION OF
SINO-US &quot;POINTS IN COMMON&quot; IN HIS FEBRUARY REPORT TO THE
NPC WAS FOLLOWED BY THE WARM WELCOME GIVEN NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR BRZEZINSKI IN MAY. THIS, IN TURN, LED TO THE
SCIENCE DELEGATION'S VISIT TO PEKING IN AUGUST LED BY
FRANK PRESS FROM WHICH ARE GROWN CONCRETE DISCUSSIONS
OF A NUMBER OF PROJECTS. STUDENT EXCHANGES IS A PROMINENT
EXAMPLE. IN ADDITION, SINO-US TRADE IS INCREASING, AMERICAN FIRMS WILL PROBABLY PARTICIPATE IN THE DEVELOPMENT
OF CHINA'S OIL AND COAL RESOURCES, AND PEKING APPARENTLY
HAS REMOVED THE US FROM THE CATEGORY OF A &quot;RESIDUAL
SUPPLIER&quot; OF GRAIN.
52. CONCURRENTLY, PEKING SEEMS TO BE PURSUING A UNITED
FRONT APPROACH TO TAIWAN. RECENT STATEMENTS HAVE EMPHASIZED THAT THE PRC HOPES THAT REUNIFICATION WILL BE
PEACEFUL. ACTIONS, SUCH AS ATTENDANCE BY PRC DELEGATES
AT A TOKYO SCIENTIFIC CONFERENCE AT WHICH ROC SCIENTISTS
WERE PRESENT, MAY SUGGEST A DESIRE TO COOPERATE WITH TAICONFIDENTIAL

WAN. HOWEVER,DESPITE THESE MOVES, PEKING HAS MADE IT
CLEAR THAT IT WILL NEVER FORESWEAR THE USE OF FORCE TO
LIBERATE TAIWAN, SINCE THIS WOULD CONSTITUTE A LIMITATION
ON ITS SOVEREIGNTY.
53. WESTERN EUROPE. EUROPE OCCUPIES A KEY POSITION IN
CHINA'S VIEW OF WORLD POLITICS AS THE FOCAL POINT OF
&quot;SUPERPOWER CONTENTION,&quot; AND THUS THE MOST LIKELY IGNITION POINT FOR THE WORLD WAR PEKING BELIEVES IS POSTPONABLE, BUT INEVITABLE. TO DELAY THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,
THE PRC HAS BEEN URGING THE STRENGTHENING OF NATO, INCLUDING CLOSE COOPERATION WITH THE US. THE RECENT CONCLUSION OF A TRADE AGREEMENT WITH THE EEC IS ALSO INTENDED
TO SUPPORT EUROPEAN UNITY. FINALLY, AS PART OF THE
&quot;BROADEST POSSIBLE UNITED FRONT&quot; AGAINST THE SOVIETS,
PEKING NOW GENERALLY ENCOURAGES EUROPEAN NATIONS' INVOLVEMENT WITH THEIR FORMER AFRICAN COLONIES AS A COUNTER TO
SOVIET INFLUENCE.
54. SOUTHEAST ASIA. CHINA'S BASIC FOREIGN POLICY OBJECTIVE IN SOUTHEAST ASIA CONTINUES TO BE THE CONTAINMENT OF
SOVIET INFLUENCE, PARTICULARLY WITH REGARD TO THE SOVIET
UNION'S POSSIBLE USE OF HANOI AS A &quot;CAT PAW&quot; TOWARD MOSCOW'S GOAL OF &quot;WORLDWIDE HEGEMONISM.&quot; RELATIONS BETWEEN
PEKING AND HANOI HAVE CONTINUED TO DETERIORATE: CHINA
HAS ACCUSED VIETNAM OF SEEKING &quot;REGIONAL HEGEMONISM&quot;; THE
ISSUE OF ETHNIC CHINESE WHO FLED ACROSS THE SINO-VIETNAMESE BORDER HAS NOT BEEN RESOLVED DESPITE CONTINUING
NEGOTIATIONS; AND PEKING CONTINUES TO PROVIDE MATERIAL
AND VERBAL SUPPORT TO KAMPUCHEA. ALTHOUGH IT REMAINS
UNLIKELY CHINA WOULD INTERVENE MILITARILY IN THE KAMPUCHEAN- VIETNAMESE CONFLICT, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT FURTHER
INCIDENTS MAY OCCUR ALONG THE SINO-VIETNAMESE BORDER.
(THERE IS AT PRESENT NO EVIDENCE, HOWEVER, OF A MAJOR
MILITARY BUILD UP ON THE SINO-VIETNAMESE BORDER.)

55. PEKING CONTINUES TO SEEK IMPROVEMENT OF ITS TIES
WITH OTHER SOUTHEAST ASIAN NATIONS. ESTABLISHMENT OF
FORMAL DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS WITH INDONESIA AND SINGAPORE

SINGAPORE IN NOVEMBER. HOWEVER, PEKING'S TREATMENT OF

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
THE ETHNIC CHINESE ISSUE AND ITS CONTROVERSY WITH VIETNAM HAVE RAISED TRADITIONAL FEARS OF CHINESE INTERFERENCE
IN OTHER SOUTHEAST ASIAN STATES WITH LARGE ETHNIC CHINESE
MINORITY GROUPS. CHINA CONTINUES TO SEE ASEAN AS A BULWARK AGAINST SOVIET INFLUENCE,BUT IS CONCERNED OVER
VIETNAM'S SUDDEN INTEREST IN ASEAN AND PHAM VAN DONG'S
ROUND OF VISITS TO ASEAN CAPITALS.
56. KOREA. SOVIET-NORTH KOREAN RELATIONS HAVE GRADUALLY
COOLED OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS DUE TO MOSCOW'S MISTRUST
FOR KIM IL-SUNG'S LEADERSHIP, ALLOWING A NATURAL OPENING
FOR PEKING. IN SEPTEMBER VICE-PREMIER KENG PIAO DESCRIBED
1978 AS A YEAR IN WHICH SINO-KOREAN FRIENDSHIP REACHED A
NEW PEAK. VISITING NORTH KOREA IN MID-SEPTEMBER IN CONNECTION WITH THE 30TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE DPRK, VICE
CHAIRMAN TENG HSIAO-P'ING RENEWED CHINA'S PLEDGE TO
&quot;STEADFASTLY SUPPORT THE KOREAN PEOPLE IN THEIR JUST
STRUGGLE FOR THE INDEPENDENT AND PEACEFUL REUNIFICATION
OF THEIR COUNTRY.&quot; PEKING CONTINUES TO STRESS, HOWEVER,
THAT ITS COMMITMENT IS TO PEACEFUL REUNIFICATION. WARY
OF SOVIET DESIGNS, PEKING ACCUSED MOSCOW OF &quot;FLIRTING&quot;
WITH SEOUL WHEN A SOUTH KOREAN DELEGATION VISITED MOSCOW
IN SEPTEMBER,AND OF BETRAYING THE STRUGGLE FOR REUNIFICATION WHEN ON SEPTEMBER 7 A SOVIET PAPER REFERRED TO SOUTH
KOREA FOR THE FIRST TIME AS &quot;THE REPUBLIC OF KOREA.&quot;

57. THE MIDDLE EAST. CHINA HAS PUBLICLY EXPRESSED SUPPORT FOR THE SADAT PEACE INITIATIVE DESPITE THE RISK SUCH
SUPPORT POSES FOR PEKING'S TIES TO THE PLO AND THE ARAB
STEADFAST FRONT STATES. WHILE PEKING HAS TAKEN NO PUBLIC
POSITION ON THE CAMP DAVID SUMMIT, CHINESE PUBLICITY
OF THE AGREEMENTS REACHED INDICATES AT LEAST TENTATIVE
APPROVAL. PEKING'S &quot;WAIT AND SEE STANCE&quot; IS PROBABLY
CLOSELY TIED TO A DESIRE NOT TO ALIENATE THE ARAB STATES
WHICH OPPOSE EGYPT'S PEACE INITIATIVE. VERBAL SUPPORT
FOR THE PALESTINIAN CAUSE CONTINUES, BUT CHINA HAS IMPLICITLY AGREED TO ISRAEL'S RIGHT TO EXIST THROUGH
REFRAINING FROM THE BELLICOSE STANCE OF EARLIER YEARS.
THE PRC HAS NOT EXCLUSIVELY BACKED ANY OF THE PARTIES TO
THE CONTINUING LEBANESE CONFLICT, CALLING INSTEAD FOR
ARAB UNITY AGAINST WHAT IT DESCRIBES AS ZIONIST EXPANSIONISM AND SOVIET HEGEMONISM. PEKING SEES INSTABILITY IN
THE AREA AS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE SOVIET UNION TO INCREASE ITS INFLUENCE THROUGH THE PROVISION OF ARMS.
58. THE CHINESE EFFORT TO CONSOLIDATE ITS POSITION IN
THE MIDDLE EAST IS CONTINUING. IT ESTABLISHED DIPLOMATIC

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
RELATIONS WITH OMAN IN APRIL AND WITH LIBYA IN JULY.
WHERE RELATIONS WITH MOSCOW HAVE BEEN WEAK, AS WITH
EGYPT, OR HAVE DETERIORATED SOMEWHAT, AS IN IRAQ, CHINA
HAS SOUGHT TO STRENGTHEN TIES. ALTHOUGH CHINA HAS LITTLE
MATERIAL INCENTIVE TO OFFER THE ARABS IT CONTINUES LOW
LEVELS OF ECONOMIC AND MILITARY AID TO SEVERAL STATES.
THE PRC ALSO HAS TRADE TIES WITH MOST STATES IN THE REGION.
59. CHAIRMAN HUA'S VISIT TO IRAN IN AUGUST FURTHER EMPHASIZED THE IMPORTANCE OF THE MIDDLE EAST TO CHINA, PARTICULARLY IN REGARD TO THE IRANIAN-PROPOSED GULF SECURITY
PACT WHICH IS INTENDED TO EXCLUDE SOVIET INFLUENCE
FROM THE PERSIAN GULF LITTORAL. CHINA'S CONCERN OVER

PAGE 24

STATE 256102

GROWING SOVIET INFLUENCE IN THE PEOPLE'S DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF YEMEN APPARENTLY TRIGGERED ESTABLISHMENT OF
TIES WITH OMAN AND EFFORTS TOWARD THE SAME END WITH SAUDI
ARABIA AND THE UNITED ARAB EMIRATES. CHINESE INFLUENCE
IN THE PDRY HAS LESSENED APPRECIABLY DURING THE PAST YEAR
DUE TO INCREASING SOVIET INFLUENCE AND CHINESE OPPOSITION
TO THE USE OF ADEN IN THE SOVIET AIRLIFT TO ETHIOPIA.
60. DOMESTIC UNREST IN IRAN AND THE POSSIBILITY OF POLITICAL TURMOIL IN EGYPT, SHOULD SADAT'S PEACE INITIATIVE
FAIL, ARE OF CENTRAL CONCERN TO CHINA IN ITS DEALINGS
WITH THE MIDDLE EAST. ALTHOUGH THE PRC'S ABILITY TO
INFLUENCE EVENTS IN THE MIDDLE EAST IS LIMITED, RELATIONS
WITH IT HAVE A SYMBOLIC, ANTI-SOVIET SIGNIFICANCE AND CAN
BE USED BY THE MIDDLE EAST STATES TO DEMONSTRATE POLITICAL
INDEPENDENCE FROM THE OTHER MAJOR POWERS.
61. SOUTH ASIA. REPORTS FROM BOTH PEKING AND NEW DELHI
CURRENTLY DEMONSTRATE A STRONG DESIRE TO IMPROVE SINOINDIAN RELATIONS. INDIAN FOREIGN MINISTER VAJPAYEE'S
FORTHCOMING VISIT TO PEKING MAY RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT
PROGRESS IN THE SINO-INDIAN TERRITORIAL DISPUTE. CHINA
REPORTEDLY HAS ALREADY INDICATED A WILLINGNESS TO ALLOW
INDIAN PILGRIMS TO VISIT HINDU HOLY PLACES IN TIBET FROM
WHICH THEY HAVE BEEN EXCLUDED FOR SOME 20 YEARS. SEVERAL
RECENT EXCHANGES OF DELEGATIONS, INCLUDING TRADE AND
JOURNALIST GROUPS, HAVE FURTHER THAWED SINO-INDIAN RELATIONS WHICH, DESPITE AN EXCHANGE OF AMBASSADORS IN 1976,
HAD REMAINED COOL.

A MARKED INCREASE IN SOVIET INFLUENCE IN THE LATTER, HAS

CONTRIBUTED TO A SENSE OF URGENCY IN PEKING'S DRIVE
TO IMPROVE ITS RELATIONS WITH THE SUBCONTINENT. PREVIOUSLY LUKEWARM TOWARD THE CENTRAL TREATY ORGANIZATION, PEKING
HAS NOW MADE IT KNOWN THAT CENTO SHOULD BE STRENGTHENED
AS AN ANTI-SOVIET BULWARK.
63. IN A HIGH LEVEL GESTURE OF GOODWILL, VICE PREMIER
KENG PIAO VISITED PAKISTAN IN LATE JUNE TO OPEN OFFICIALLY
THE KARAKORAM HIGHWAY, BEGUN IN 1966 AND LARGELY BUILT
BY CHINESE LABORERS. PAKISTANI FOREIGN ADVISER AGHA
SHAHI VISITED PEKING IN SEPTEMBER AND RECEIVED CHINESE
ASSURANCES OF CONTINUED CHINESE SUPPORT. A FLURRY OF
CONTACTS INCLUDING A VISIT BY KING BIRENDRA IN MAY HAS
APPARENTLY GIVEN NEW DEPTH TO LONGSTANDING SINO-NEPALESE
TIES. RELATIONS WITH BANGLADESH LIKEWISE REMAIN WARM.
64. AFRICA. CHINA'S MAIN GOALS IN AFRICA ARE TO OPPOSE
THE EXPANSION OF SOVIET INFLUENCE AND STRENGTHEN INDEPENDENCE THROUGH ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. CHINA CONTINUES TO
SEE AFRICA AS A CRUCIAL AREA IN WHICH SOVIET EXPANSION
MUST BE CONTAINED, BELIEVING MOSCOW PLANS TO OUTFLANK
EUROPE BY MONOPOLIZING AFRICAN RESOURCES AND MARKETS
AND BY THREATENING THE VITAL SEA LANES AROUND AFRICA AND
THROUGH THE SUEZ CANAL. CUBA'S ROLE IN AFRICA AS A SOVIET
&quot;TROJAN HORSE&quot; IS FREQUENTLY CITED BY PEKING AND CHINA
HAS ENCOURAGED THE AFRICAN STATES TO OUST CUBA FROM
THE NON-ALIGNED MOVEMENT. CHINESE AID PROGRAMS CONTINUE
IN COUNTRIES SUCH AS GABON, GHANA,ZAIRE AND CAMEROON AND
CHINA'S REPUTATION FOR NO-STRINGS ATTACHED AID HELPS
OFFSET THE IRRITATION OF ITS ANTI-SOVIET PROPAGANDA.
65. BEING UNABLE TO COMPETE WITH MOSCOW IN EITHER
ECONOMIC OR MILITARY ASSISTANCE, PEKING HAS RECENTLY INCREASED BOTH ITS DIPLOMATIC ACTIVITY AND EXCHANGES OF DELEGATIONS. SENIOR CHINESE OFFICIALS TO VISIT AFRICA IN
RECENT MONTHS INCLUDED FOREIGN MINISTER HUANG HUA, WHO

66. THE TWO SITUATIONS THAT PRESENTLY CONCERN THE CHINESE

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
MOST ARE CONTINUING UNREST IN THE HORN AND THE SITUATION
IN SOUTHERN AFRICA. PEKING SEES ITS INTERESTS AS BEST
SERVED BY POLITICAL STABILITY AND NEGOTIATED SETTLEMENTS,
AS PROLONGED MILITARY CONFLICT IS CERTAIN TO DRIVE AFRICAN
GROUPS TOWARD THE SOVIET UNION FOR ARMS THAT CHINA CANNOT
SUPPLY. NONETHELESS, CHINA CONTINUES TO SUPPORT ARMED
STRUGGLE IN SOUTHERN AFRICA. THIS APPARENT CONTRADICTION
PROBABLY STEMS FROM THE NEED TO MAINTAIN A REVOLUTIONARY
IMAGE IN THE THIRD WORLD AS WELL AS THE KNOWLEDGE THAT
ATTEMPTS TO DISSAUDE AFRICANS FROM ARMED STRUGGLE WOULD
LEND CREDENCE TO SOVIET CHARGES OF CHINESE COLLABORATION
WITH &quot;REACTIONARIES.&quot; THUS, WHILE CHINA CONTINUES TO
PROVIDE LIMITED MILITARY AID TO SEVERAL GOVERNMENTS AND
GROUPS, THE PRC HAS MAINLY SOUGHT TO DISTINGUISH ITSELF
BY OSTENSIBLY STAYING OUT OF CONTENTION AND SUPPORTING
THE POPULAR AFRICAN THEMES OF UNITY AND SELF RELIANCE.
67. LATIN AMERICA. BOLIVIA, COLOMBIA, URAGUAY AND THE
MAJORITY OF THE CENTRAL AMERICAN COUNTRIES MAINTAIN DIPLOMATIC TIES WITH TAIPEI. HOWEVER, PEKING HAS EXTENDED
ITS WORLDWIDE DIPLOMATIC PUSH INTO LATIN AMERICA AND THERE
ARE REPORTS COLOMBIA MAY SOON RECOGNIZE THE PRC. A SMALL
PRC MISSION WAS OPENED IN BARBADOS IN APRIL (RELATIONS HAD
BEEN ESTABLISHED A YEAR EARLIER) AND A THREE-YEAR TRADE
AGREEMENT WAS SIGNED WITH ARGENTINA IN JUNE. ALSO IN

CHINESE OFFICIAL EVER TO VISIT LATIN AMERICA, THE VISIT
WAS MORE CEREMONIAL THAN SUBSTANTIVE.
68. THE MEXICAN PRESIDENT AND THE CHILEAN MINISTER OF
FOREIGN RELATIONS ARE EXPECTED TO VISIT PEKING SOON.
MUCH OF CHINA'S CURRENT ATTENTION TO LATIN AMERICA, THOUGH
STILL LOW KEY, IS IN RESPONSE TO CHINA'S PERCEPTION OF
CUBA AS &quot;A SURROGATE&quot; OF SOVIET INFLUENCE IN THE AREA.

HAVANA, WITH CASTRO RECENTLY REFERRING TO CHINA'S &quot;TRAITOR

KOREA

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014

68. THE PAST YEAR HAS BEEN AT BEST A MIDDLING ONE FOR
PYONGYANG. THE DPRK ECONOMY CONTINUES TO STAGNATE AND,
ALREADY LESS THAN HALF THE SIZE OF SOUTH KOREA'S, IT
FALLS EVEN FARTHER BACK AT AN ALMOST VISIBLE DAILY RATE.
WHILE THE NORTH KOREAN HARD-CURRENCY DEBT HAS KEPT STEADY
AT ABOUT 1.5 BILLION DOLLARS, PYONGYANG HAS BARELY KEPT
UP WITH THE RESCHEDULED PAYMENTS OF INTEREST ON THE DEBT,
AND HAS NOT REDUCED THE PRINCIPAL AT ALL. CONTINUED CREDIT TO THE DPRK HAS BECOME SOMETHING OF A POLITICAL QUESTION IN JAPAN, WHICH TO DATE HAS BEEN THE DPRK'S MAJOR
SOURCE OF MODERN TECHNOLOGY NEEDED FOR ADVANCING THE ECONOMY.

69. LONG A DIPLOMATIC FENCE-STRADDLER BETWEEN THE
PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA AND THE SOVIET UNION,OF LATE
NORTH KOREA SEEMS TO HAVE TILTED TOWARD THE CHINESE. CHINA'S CHAIRMAN AND PREMIER,HUA KUO-FENG,VISITED PYONGYANG
IN MAY, TO BE FOLLOWEDIN AUGUST BY A HIGH RANKING CHINESE
MILITARY DELEGATION AND IN SEPTEMBER, FOR THE DPRK'S
30TH ANNIVERSARY FETE, BY VICE-PREMIER TENG. ON THE OTHER
HAND, KIM'S TRIP TO MOSCOW, RUMORED TO BE PLANNED FOR
THIS YEAR, HAS NOT BEEN ANNOUNCED AND MAY WELL HAVE BEEN
CANCELLED. IN THE RECOGNITION CONTEST BETWEEN THE NORTH
AND THE SOUTH, THE DPRK ADVANCED ONE NOTCH WHEN NEWLYSOCIALIST AFGHANISTAN WITHDREW RECOGNITION FROM THE ROK,
BUT LOST HALF A NOTCH ON A FAR MORE IMPORTANT GAME-BOARD
WHEN SWEDEN DECIDED TO UPGRADE ITS MISSION IN SEOUL TO
A RESIDENT EMBASSY.
70. NORTH KOREA CONTINUES ITS POLICY OF SKEWING ITS
ECONOMY TOWARD THE MILITARY. ABOUT 15 PER CENT OF THE
GNP APPEARS TO GO TOWARD THE MILITARY, WITH AN EVEN GREATER PERCENTAGE OF THE HIGHEST-QUALITY RESOURCES DEVOTED
TO THE MILITARY SECTOR. THE NORTH APPEARS TO BE PUSHING
TO EXPAND ITS OWN MILITARY PRODUCTION CAPABILITIES INTO
NEW AREAS, REDUCING THEIR NEEDS FROM THE PRC AND THE USSR.
71. KIM IL-SONG CONTINUES TO RULE THE DPRK IN A ONE-MAN
FASHION ALMOST UNPARALLELED IN THE REST OF TODAY'S WORLD.
KIM'S HEALTH APPEARS GOOD. THERE IS STILL NOT, HOWEVER,
ANY ESTABLISHED MECHANISM FOR SUCCESSION, AND KIM HAS
APPARENTLY NOT ABANDONED HOPES THAT HIS SON, KIM CHONG-IL,
WILL BE THE NEXT HEAD OF THE DPRK. BECAUSE OF THE UNPOPULARITY OF THE IDEA OF AN OFFSPRING SUCCESSION AMONG THE
OTHER SOCIALIST STATES, AND POSSIBLY BECAUSE OF ADVERSE

SENTIMENT AMONG THE NORTH KOREAN MILITARY, KIM HAS KEPT
HIS DESIRES AND EFFORTS TO CONTROL THE SUCCESSION VERY
MUCH UNDER WRAPS.
B. THE SITUATION IN THE REPUBLIC OF KOREA
72. AN EXTRAORDINARILY HIGH RATE OF GROWTH AND THE HIGH
VISIBILITY OF ITS EXPORT-LED GROWTH STRATEGY ARE GIVING
THE ROK INCREASING PROMINENCE IN THE WORLD COMMUNITY. AT
HOME PRESIDENT PARK'S POSITION REMAINS STRONG DESPITE THE
ACTIVITIES OF DISSIDENT GROUPS, AND THERE IS NO EFFECTIVE
POLITICAL OPPOSITION. THE PUBLIC RESPONSE TO THE GOVERNMENT'S ECONOMIC ACHIEVEMENTS HAS BEEN ONE OF BROAD ACCEPTANCE AND SUPPORT.
73. IN THE FIRST HALF OF 1978 REAL GNP GROWTH WAS AT A
16 PER CENT RATE OVER THE 20 BILLION DOLLARS LEVEL OF 1977,
AND THE EXPORT TARGET OF 12.5 BILLION DOLLARS SEEMED
ATTAINABLE. SOUTH KOREA HAS CLEARLY OUTSTRIPPED THE NORTH
IN ECONOMIC GROWTH, AND THE GAP IS LIKELY TO WIDEN OVER
THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS. BARRING SUCH UNFORESEEN CIRCUMSTANCES AS A WORLDWIDE DEPRESSION, THE ROK'S AMBITIOUS
ECONOMIC GROWTH TARGETS FOR THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS
SEEM REASONABLE.
-- - -74. OVER THE PAST TWO YEARS KOREA'S TRADITIONALLY CLOSE
RELATIONSHIP WITH THE UNITED STATES HAS BEEN SHAKEN BY
THE &quot;KOREAGATE,&quot; HUMAN RIGHTS AND TROOP WITHDRAWAL ISSUES,
BUT THE PROCESS OF RENEWING THE RELATIONSHIP HAS BEGUN.
KOREAGATE APPEARS TO HAVE RUN ITS COURSE, AND THE IMPACT
OF WITHDRAWAL OF 3,400 TROOPS IN 1978 HAS BEEN CUSHIONED
BY CONGRESSIONAL APPROVAL OF AN 800 MILLION DOLLARS EQUIPMENT TRANSFER PACKAGE AND A CONTINUING FOREIGN MILITARY
SALES CREDIT PROGRAM OF 275 MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY.
75. WHILE UNHAPPY ABOUT THE TROOP WITHDRAWAL DECISION,
THE ROK NOW ACCEPTS THAT GIVEN THE ON-GOING US COMMITMENT,

THE RETENTION OF U.S. AIR POWER IN KOREA AND THE AVAILABILITY OF U.S. SEA POWER IN THE AREA, IT IS CAPABLE OF
DETERRING OR DEFEATING A NORTH KOREAN ATTACK. THE LARGE
AND WELL-EQUIPPED SOUTH KOREAN FORCES REMAIN UNDER THE
OPERATIONAL CONTROL OF THE COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF OF THE UN
COMMAND, BUT IN RECOGNITION OF THE LARGE ROLE BEING PLAYED
BY KOREA A NEW COMBINED FORCES COMMAND WILL BE INAUGURATED

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
THIS FALL THAT PROVIDES FOR MUCH GREATER ROK PARTICIPATION
IN THE CHAIN OF COMMAND.
76. THE YEAR 1978 HAS BEEN AN UNEVEN YEAR IN THE EVOLUTION OF THE KOREAN HUMAN RIGHTS REGIME, BUT PROGRESS IS
DISCERNIBLE. ALL BUT ONE OF THE MOST PROMINENT DISSIDENTS
IN CUSTODY HAVE BEEN RELEASED, PRESS CENSORSHIP HAS BEEN
RELAXED SOMEWHAT AND THE GOVERNMENT HAS SHOWN GREATER
RESTRAINT IN HANDLING STUDENT DEMONSTRATIONS. SOME PROVOCATIVE MANIFESTOES HAVE ALSO BEEN IGNORED. ON THE OTHER
HAND THE LEGAL MACHINERY WHICH HAS ENABLED THE REGIME TO
USE REPRESSIVE TACTICS REMAINS INTACT. IN LATE SEPTEMBER
THE INCREASED VIGOR WITH WHICH POLICE BROKE UP A SMALL
DEMONSTRATION OF DISSIDENT LABORERS WHO WERE SHOUTING
PERSONAL ATTACKS ON THE PRESIDENT SEEMED TO SIGNAL AN
ESCALATION OF TACTICS BY BOTH SIDES. DISSIDENT LEADERS
SEEM DETERMINED TO PROVOKE A REACTION FROM THE GOVERNMENT.
C. RELATIONS BETWEEN THE TWO KOREAS
77. THERE HAS BEEN LITTLE DISCERNIBLE MOVEMENT IN THE
ALMOST-FROZEN PICTURE OF NON-CONTACT BETWEEN THE TWO
KOREAS. THE VARIOUS MECHANISMS FOR DIRECT COMMUNICATION
BETWEEN THE ANTAGONISTS THAT WERE SET UP IN THE EARLY
1970,S, INCLUDING THE&quot;RED CROSS TALKS,&quot; ARE NOW MORICONFIDENTIAL

BUND. ROK PRESIDENT PARK PUT FORWARD A PROPOSAL IN JUNE
FOR ECONOMIC COOPERATION BETWEEN THE TWO KOREAS, BUT THE
PROPOSAL WAS QUICKLY REJECTED AND DENOUNCED BY THE NORTH.
KIM'S SEPTEMBER 9 SPEECH ON THE DPRK'S 30TH ANNIVERSARY
NOTED THAT THE DPRK GOVERNMENT WOULD BE WILLING TO HAVE
CONTACT WITH SOUTH KOREAN AUTHORITIES OR PARTIES, BUT WITH
PRECONDITIONS CLEARLY POLITICALLY UNACCEPTABLE TO THE ROK.
IV. SOUTHEAST ASIA
A. VIETNAM
78. THERE HAS BEEN SERIOUS DETERIORATION THIS YEAR IN
SINO-VIETNAMESE RELATIONS, CONCURRENT WITH AN IMPROVEMENT
IN VIETNAM'S RELATIONS WITH THE USSR. THIS SITUATION
CONTRASTS SHARPLY WITH THE RECENT PAST, ESPECIALLY
PRIOR TO 1975, WHEN VIETNAM SUSTAINED A SUCCESSFUL BALANCING ACT BETWEEN CHINA AND THE USSR, WHEREBY VIETNAM
OBTAINED NEEDED ASSISTANCE FROM BOTH COUNTRIES WHILE
AVOIDING EXCESSIVE DEPENDENCE ON EITHER.

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
79. THE IMMEDIATE CAUSE OF THE CHANGE HAS BEEN VIETNAM'S
CONFLICT WITH KAMPUCHEA. VIETNAM SEES PEKING'S SUPPORT
OF PHNOM PENH AS THE MAIN OBSTACLE TO ENDING THE COSTLY
BORDER WAR AND TO ITS LONGER TERM INTEREST IN ESTABLISHING
A RELATIONSHIP WITH KAMPUCHEA SIMILAR TO THE ONE IT HAS
WITH LAOS. PEKING, ON ITS PART, WANTS TO CURB VIETNAM'S
DRIVE FOR &quot;HEGEMONY&quot; IN INDOCHINA AND TO COUNTERACT WHAT
IT SEES AS HANOI'S MOVEMENT TOWARD CLOSER RELATIONS WITH
MOSCOW. SINO-VIETNAMESE TENSIONS WERE UNDOUBTEDLY HEIGHTENED AFTER HANOI INTENSIFIED ITS EFFORTS IN JUNE AGAINST
THE INTRANSIGENT PHNOM PENH REGIME WITH THE OCCUPATION
OF AREAS ON THE KAMPUCHEAN SIDE OF THE BORDER AND MORE
ACTIVE BACKING OF ANTI-PHNOM PENH INSURGENTS. HANOI
APPARENTLY DECIDED TO STAND FIRM AGAINST PEKING'S PRESCONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL
PAGE 32

STATE 256102

SURES, PROBABLY CALCULATING THAT PEKING WILL NOT INTERVENE MILITARILY.
80. THE ERUPTION OF SHARP DIFFERENCES BETWEEN HANOI AND
PEKING OVER THE ISSUE OF VIETNAM'S TREATMENT OF THE ETHNIC
CHINESE (AND THE ETHNIC CHINESE REFUGEES) HAS FURTHER
COMPLICATED THE RELATIONSHIP AND INTRODUCED NEW DANGERS
OF CONFLICT. THIS HIGHLY EMOTIONAL ISSUE APPEARS TO STEM
FROM CAUSES LARGELY INDEPENDENT OF THE VIETNAM-KAMPUCHEA
CONFLICT, I.E. HANOI'S MOVES BEGUN EARLY THIS YEAR TO ADVANCE SOCIALIZATION OF THE PRIVATE COMMERCIAL SECTOR, A
CAMPAIGN THAT IMPACTED LARGELY ON THE ETHNIC CHINESE.
IN ANY CASE,PEKING HAS HANDLED THE ISSUE IN A WAY THAT
AT LEAST IN PART IS DESIGNED TO PRESSURE AND WORRY HANOI
OVER ANY ACTIONS IT MAY TAKE THAT CHINA WOULD CONSIDER
HOSTILE. OVER THE MONTHS SUCH PRESSURES HAVE INCLUDED
POLEMICAL ATTACKS, THE CLOSING OF VIETNAM'S CONSULATES IN
CHINA,THE SENDING HOME OF VIETNAMESE STUDENTS, THE WITHDRAWAL OF AMBASSADORS, AND THE REDUCTION AND THEN FULL
TERMINATION OF CHINESE AID TO VIETNAM. WHILE THERE HAVE
BEEN INDICATIONS THAT BOTH SIDES WANT TO DEFUSE THE ETHNIC
CHINESE ISSUE, THE INCIDENTS THAT HAVE OCCURRED ALONG THE
BORDER AND THE RECENT BREAKDOWN OF THE VICE FOREIGN
MINISTER LEVEL TALKS MAKE FOR A TENSE SITUATION.
81. IN THE WAKE OF THE SERIOUS DETERIORATION OF ITS
RELATIONS WITH CHINA, VIETNAM HAS MOVED CLOSER TO THE USSR.
THIS WAS INDICATED BY HANOI'S DECISION IN JULY TO OFFICIALLY JOIN THE COUNCIL FOR MUTUAL ECONOMIC ASSISTANCE
(CEMA). THERE HAVE BEEN INDICATIONS OF AUGMENTATION OF
THE SOVIET PRESENCE IN VIETNAM, BUT NO EVIDENCE OF SOVIET
BASES OR MISSILES IN VIETNAM, AS PEKING HAS ALLEGED. IT

STATE 256102

SEEMS LIKELY, HOWEVER, THAT VIETNAM, WHILE IT MAY ESTABLISH CLOSER RELATIONS WITH THE USSR, WILL DO ALL IT CAN
TO MAINTAIN ITS INDEPENDENCE. THIS IS LIKELY THE MAIN
MOTIVATION BEHIND HANOI'S INTENSIVE DIPLOMATIC CAMPAIGN
IN SOUTHEAST ASIA AND EUROPE, INCLUDING THE SOFTENING
OF ITS ATTITUDE TOWARD ASEAN AND THE CONCEPT OF A ZONE
OF PEACE. HANOI'S INITIATIVES TOWARD ITS NON-COMMUNIST
NEIGHBORS ARE ALSO INTENDED TO PRE-EMPT CHINA'S NEWLY
ASSERTIVE DIPLOMACY.
B. KAMPUCHEA
82. VIETNAM'S CURRENT MILITARY OPERATIONS IN KAMPUCHEA,
WHICH BEGAN IN JUNE, APPEAR AIMED AT ENDING PERSISENT
KHMER ATTACKS INSIDE VIETNAM, DESTROYING UNITS O KAMPUCHEA'S MAIN FORCES, AND INSERTING PRO-HANOI KHMERS
TRAINED IN VIETNAM FOR THE PURPOSE OF SUBVERTING THE POL
POT REGIME. THERE ARE INDICATIONS THAT VIETNAM IS REINFORCING ITS UNITS NEAR THE BORDER, AND PEKING HAS
ALLEGED THAT VIETNAM INTENDS TO LAUNCH A NEW OFFENSIVE
AS SOON AS THE CURRENT WET SEASON IS OVER. IT IS UNLIKELY
HOWEVER, THAT VIETNAM INTENDS TO ASSAULT PHNOM PENH
DIRECTLY OR TO SEIZE LARGE AREAS OF THE COUNTRY, DUE TO
UNCERTAINTY OVER THE CHINESE REACTION, THE HIGH COST
OF SUCH AN OPERATION IN THE FACE OF FIERCE RESISTANCE,
AND THE LIKELY UNFAVORABLE INTERNATIONAL REACTION.
83. THERE HAVE BEEN SIGNS THAT VIETNAMESE PRESSURES ARE
CAUSING DIFFICULTIES FOR THE PRESENT KAMPUCHEAN REGIME.
THESE SIGNS INCLUDE: AN INCREASED FLOW OF KAMPUCHEAN
REFUGEES INTO THAILAND, APPARENTLY MADE POSSIBLE BY THE
DIVERSION OF KAMPUCHEAN MILITARY FORCES AWAY FROM THE THAI
BORDER TO MEET NEEDS ON THE VIETNAM FRONT; THE INABILITY
OF THE KHMER FORCES, DESPITE SHARP COUNTERATTACKS, TO
RETAKE TOWNS OR TERRITORY IN EASTERN KAMPUCHEA CAPTURED
BY THE VIETNAMESE; AND SIGNS OF SPREADING INSURGENT
CONFIDENTIAL

RESISTANCE.
84. ON THE OTHER HAND, THE REGIME HAS SHOWN ITSELF TO BE
TOUGH, STUBBORN, AND RELENTLESS, WITH A GREAT CAPACITY
FOR SURVIVAL -- FACTORS THAT MAKE IT HARD TO WRITE IT OFF.
DESPITE OBVIOUS PROBLEMS, THE ARMY REMAINS LOYAL AND

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
FIGHTS HARD TO THE APPARENT SURPRISE OF VIETNAM. HISTORICAL CONSIDERATIONS AND FIERCE NATIONAL AND ETHNIC ANIMOSITIES ARE IMPORTANT UNDERLYING REASONS. IRONICALLY,
PHNOM PENH'S INCREASED ACTIVITY TO WIN SUPPORT ABROAD IN
ITS HOUR OF NEED IS HANDICAPPED BY ITS PAST BELLIGERENT
ATTITUDE TOWARD OTHER COUNTRIES AND ITS BRUTAL DOMESTIC
POLICIES WHICH HAVE MADE IT A PARIAH TO SOME.
C. LAOS
85. VIETNAM'S &quot;SPECIAL RELATIONSHIP&quot; WITH LAOS CONTINUES,
GIVEN SUBSTANCE BY THE PRESENCE OF LARGE NUMBERS OF
VIETNAMESE ADVISORS IN THE LAO GOVERNMENT AND VIETNAMESE
TROOPS WHO ARE HELPING THE GOVERNMENT PUT DOWN INTERNAL
RESISTANCE. VIETNAMESE MILITARY ENGINEERS AND OTHER
SPECIALISTS ARE ASSISTING IN DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS AS WELL.
86. SEVERAL RECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN LAOS ARE UNCLEAR,
INCLUDING REPORTS OF WITHDRAWAL OF CHINESE ROAD BUILDING
UNITS IN NORTHERN LAOS. THE EXTENT OF THEIR WITHDRAWAL
AND THE REASONS (IT MIGHT SIMPLY REFLECT THE COMPLETION
OF PROJECTS) ARE UNCERTAIN. IT IS ALSO UNCERTAIN WHETHER
CHINESE UNITS NOT INVOLVED IN ROAD BUILDING HAVE BEEN
WITHDRAWN. WHATEVER THE DETAILS, THE RUGGED AREA OF
NORTHERN LAOS HAS LONG BEEN AN AREA OF CHINESE INTEREST
AND INFLUENCE, PARTICULARLY WITH THE TRIBAL GROUPS THERE.
CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL
PAGE 35

STATE 256102

IT SEEMS UNLIKELY THAT CHINA WOULD ABANDON ITS PREDOMINANT
POSITION OR THAT THE VIETNAMESE WOULD SEEK TO CONFRONT
THE CHINESE IN THAT AREA. THERE HAVE BEEN VIETNAMESE
CHARGES OF PRC SUPPORT TO INSURGENTS ELSEWHERE IN LAOS,
BUT WE HAVE SEEN NO EVIDENCE THAT THIS IS THE CASE.
D. THE ASEAN STATES
87. INDONESIA. IN MARCH 1978 PRESIDENT SUHARTO WAS REELECTED TO A THIRD FIVE-YEAR TERM AND FORMER FOREIGN
MINISTER ADAM MALIK ELECTED AS VICE PRESIDENT. THE
POLITICAL SITUATION, ALTHOUGH IT BECAME SOMEWHAT HEATED
IN PREPARATION FOR THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION, IS NOW
BASICALLY STABLE. INDONESIA IS APPROACHING ITS THIRD
FIVE YEAR PLAN WHICH RECOGNIZES THE NEED TO PLACE OVERWHELMING EMPHASIS ON THE DUAL NEEDS OF EMPLOYMENT AND
AGRICULTURE. THE HIGHLY INFLUENTIAL ARMY APPEARS UNITED
IN SUPPORT OF PRESIDENT SUHARTO'S CURRENT TERM OF OFFICE.
88. IN FOREIGN AFFAIRS INDONESIA IS A MODERATE LEADER

TO ASEAN.
89. MALAYSIA. PRIME MINISTER HUSSEIN BIN ONN, LEADER
OF THE GOVERNING POLITICAL COALITION, THE NATIONAL FRONT,
WON AN IMPRESSIVE VICTORY AND A DRAMATIC PERSONAL MANDATE
IN NATIONAL ELECTIONS IN JULY 1978. HE ALSO WON THE
PRESIDENCY OF HIS OWN PARTY, THE UMNO, IN SEPTEMBER.
THE NATIONAL FRONT PROVIDES MALAYSIA WITH A STABLE AND
EFFECTIVE GOVERNMENT MARKED BY EFFORTS TO SATISFY THE
OFTEN CONFLICTING INTERESTS OF THE TWO MAJOR COMMUNITIES
(THE MALAYS AND THE CHINESE). MALAY ATTEMPTS TO OBTAIN

A LARGER SHARE OF THE ECONOMIC REWARDS HAS ALIENATED
MANY CHINESE AND INDIANS, AND THIS WAS REFLECTED BY A
DISTURBING TREND TOWARD RACIAL POLARIZATION IN THE GENERAL
ELECTION. PM HUSSEIN HAS CONTINUED THE SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC
DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS INITIATED BY THE FORMER RAZAK GOVERNMENT, AS WELL AS GIVING HIGH PRIORITY TO COMBATTING THE
COMMUNIST INSURGENCY. ALTHOUGH STILL ALIVE, THE INSURGENCY IS NOT CURRENTLY A THREAT TO THE POLITICAL OR ECONOMIC
LIFE OF THE COUNTRY.

ON NORTH-SOUTH ISSUES AND AVOIDS EXTREME POSITIONS.
93. THE U.S. IS CURRENTLY DISCUSSING WITH THE PHILIPPINES
AMENDMENTS TO THE MILITARY BASES AGREEMENT -- WHICH RUNS
TO 1991 AND THEREAFTER BECOMES SUBJECT TO ABROGATION BY
EITHER PARTY ON ONE YEAR'S NOTICE--THAT WOULD PROVIDE
A CLEARER AFFIRMATION OF PHILIPPINE SOVEREIGNTY WHILE AT
THE SAME TIME ASSURING THE U.S. EFFECTIVE COMMAND AND CONTROL OVER THE ESSENTIAL MILITARY FACILITIES.
94. THAILAND. DESPITE THE LARGE NUMBER OF CHANGES OF
REGIME SINCE THE OVERTHROW OF THE ABSOLUTE MONARCHY IN
1932, THE POWERFUL CIVILIAN AND MILITARY BUREAUCRACIES
MAINTAIN CONSIDERABLE CONTINUITY IN IMPLEMENTING GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS. THAILAND REMAINS A FUNDAMENTALLY STABLE
SOCIETY WITH A HIGH DEGREE OF RELIGIOUS AND ETHNIC UNITY.
95. THE CURRENT THAI CABINET UNDER PM (GENERAL)KRIANGSAK
CHAMANAN ASSUMED POWER ON NOVEMBER 13, 1977. KRIANGSAK
GOVERNS THROUGH AN INTERIM CONSTITUTION PENDING PROMULGATION OF A NEW CONSTITUTION AND GENERAL ELECTIONS TO BE
HELD NO LATER THAN APRIL 1979. THE KRIANGSAK GOVERNMENT
STRESSES THE THEMES OF NATIONAL RECONCILIATION AND MODERATE REFORM IN DEALING WITH THAILAND'S SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC PROBLEMS. PM KRIANGSAK HAS GAINED WIDESPREAD PUBLIC
ACCEPTANCE AND SUPPORT FOR HIS PLANS AND HAS APPOINTED
A TEAM OF UNUSUALLY COMPETENT MINISTERS. THE CURRENT

GOVERNMENT HAS CONCENTRATED ON FOREIGN AFFAIRS ON ITS ONE
YEAR IN OFFICE AND HAS NOT FOCUSSED EXTENSIVELY ON DOMESTIC REFORMS IN PART BECAUSE IT IS AN INTERIM GOVERNMENT
PENDING GENERAL ELECTIONS. THE POLITICAL SITUATION IS
CURRENTLY STABLE AND KRIANGSAK APPEARS TO ENJOY THE
SUPPORT OF ALL POLITICALLY SIGNIFICANT MILITARY AND CIVILIAN FACTIONS.

96. THAILAND BEGAN AS EARLY AS 1975 TO EXPAND ITS
DIPLOMATIC ACTIVITY IN AN EFFORT TO NORMALIZE RELATIONS
WITH THE STATES OF INDOCHINA AND THE PRC. FOLLOWING A
ONE YEAR DERAILMENT OF THESE INITIATIVES BY THE THANIN
REGIME, THE KRIANGSAK GOVERNMENTHAS ACHIEVED A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN RELATIONS WITH ASIAN COMMUNIST
STATES. BANGKOK AND HANOI EXCHANGED AMBASSADORS IN
1978 AND THE RECENT VISIT TO BANGKOK OF PREMIER PHAM
VAN DONG FURTHER CONSOLIDATED THE RELATIONSHIP. RELATIONS
WITH LAOS HAVE IMPROVED AS WELL. RELATIONS BETWEEN
THAILAND AND CAMBODIA HAVE PROVED MORE DIFFICULT,
ALTHOUGH SINCE THE JULY 1978 VISIT TO BANGKOK OF IENG SARY,
THE CAMBODIANS HAVE IND CATED A WILLINGNESS TO ALLOW
A THAI EMBASSY TO OPEN IN PHNOM PENH AND A DESIRE TO
REOPEN THEIR EMBASSY IN BANGKOK. THAILAND'S RELATIONS
WITH THE PRC REMAIN GOOD. DESPITE THIS ADJUSTMENT OF
THAI FOREIGN POLICY TO REGIONAL REALITIES, THAILAND CONTINUES TO REGARD ITS RELATIONS WITH THE ASEAN PARTNERS
AND THE UNITED STATES AS OF THE MOST FUNDAMENTAL IMPORTANCE.
97. SINGAPORE. THE PEOPLE'S ACTION PARTY (PAP) LED BY

IT ACTIVELY PROMOTES PEACEFUL AND COOPERATIVE TIES BETWEEN ITS NEIGHBORS, PARTICULARLY THE OTHER ASEAN COUNTRIES
AND IS A STRONG SUPPORTER OF ASEAN. SINGAPORE APPEARS
EVEN MORE CONCERNED THAN ITS ASEAN PARTNERS OVER LONG
TERM SOVIET AND VIETNAMESE INTENTIONS IN THE REGION AND
HAS OFTEN VOICED ITS SUPPORT FOR CONTINUED U.S. AND
WESTERN PRESENCE IN THE REGION.
99. SINGAPORE CONTINUES TO ALLOW US NAVAL VESSELS AND
AIRCRAFT TO UTILIZE PORT AND AIRFIELD FACILITIES. DURING
THE PAST YEAR THE GOS AGREED TO THE STAGING OF P-3 RECONNAISSANCE FLIGHTS OVER THE STRAITS AND INDIAN OCEAN. IT
ALSO WELCOMED THE VISIT OF THE NUCLEAR CARRIER ENTERPRISE.

A. INDIA
100. INTERNAL SITUATION. INITIAL EUPHORIA OVER THE VICTORY OF THE JANATA PARTY AND THE OUSTER OF INDIRA GANDHI
HAS GIVEN WAY TO INCREASED PUBLIC DISILLUSIONMENT WITH
THE INACTION AND CAUTIOUSNESS OF THE DESAI GOVERNMENT.
A RECENT CRISIS IN THE JANATA PARTY WHICH THREATENED ITS
UNITY HAS BEEN DEFUSED BUT NOT YET RESOLVED TO THE SATISFACTION OF ALL PARTIES. IT WAS PRECIPITATED WHEN PRIME
MINISTER DESAI SUMMARILY FIRED TWO CABINET MINISTERS
WHO PUBLICLY CRITICIZED DESAI FOR NOT MOVING MORE QUICKLY
TO PROSECUTE MRS. GANDHI. JANATA'S REAL ACHIEVEMENTS IN
RESTORING DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENT ARE FADING IN THE POPULAR

STATE 256102

MIND AS INDIA'S LONG STANDING PROBLEMS GO UNANSWERED.
101. RECORD HARVESTS, A SATISFACTORY BALANCE OF PAYMENTS
POSITION, RISING EXPORTS AND A MODERATE INFLATION RATE
HAVE BOLSTERED ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE. WITH FOREIGN
EXCHANGE RESERVES EXCEEDING 6 MILLION DOLLARS AND A FOODGRAIN STOCKPILE OF 20 MILLION TONS INDIA CAN NOW WITHSTAND ONE AND PERHAPS TWO POOR HARVESTS. NEVERTHELESS,
THERE IS GROWING DISCONTENT OVER STAGNATION IN KEY AREAS
OF THE ECONOMY.
102. FOREIGN AFFAIRS. UNTIL THE COUP IN KABUL, CONSIDERABLE PROGRESS HAD BEEN MADE IN THE NORMALIZATION OF RELATIONS BETWEEN INDIA AND PAKISTAN. THE EVENTS IN AFGHANISTAN ACCENTUATED ISLAMABAD'S BASIC RESERVATIONS ABOUT GOI
POLICY WHEN INDIA HASTENED TO RECOGNIZE THE TARAKI GOVERNMENT, SECOND ONLY TO THE SOVIETS. NEW DELHI IS HOPEFUL
THAT IT WILL RETAIN ITS TRADITIONALLY GOOD RELATIONS WITH
AFGHANISTAN AND BELIEVES THAT AFGHAN NATIONALISM AND
ISLAM WILL IMPOSE DEFINITE LIMITS ON THE GROWTH OF SOVIET
INFLUENCE, THOUGH INDIA RECOGNIZES THAT THE EROSION OF
SUPPORT FOR THE TARAKI GOVERNMENT MAY FORCE KABUL CLOSER
TO MOSCOW.
103. FOREIGN MINISTER VAJPAYEE WILL VISIT CHINA IN NOVEMBER. THE POSSIBILITY OF A BORDER SOLUTION EXISTS. HOWEVER, AS IT WOULD INVOLVE SIGNIFICANT POLITICAL COSTS FOR
BOTH SIDES, PROSPECTS FOR AN EARLY SOLUTION OF THE BORDER
ISSUE REMAIN REMOTE.
104. INDO-SOVIET RELATIONS HAVE CHANGED IN ATMOSPHERE
IF NOT REAL TERMS UNDER DESAI. ALTHOUGH DESAI PROMISED
THERE WOULD BE NO SIGNIFICANT SHIFT IN BILATERAL RELATIONS

HE HAS REFUSED TO ENDORSE THE CONCEPT OF A &quot;SPECIAL
RELATIONSHIP&quot; BETWEEN INDIA AND THE USSR.
105. WHILE ANXIOUS TO MAINTAIN AN ARMS RELATIONSHIP
WITH THE SOVIETS, THE JANATA GOVERNMENT, IN PURSUIT OF
&quot;GENUINE NON-ALIGNMENT,&quot; HAS ALSO DECIDED TO DIVERSIFY
ITS SOURCES OF SUPPLY. THE GOI APPEARS TO BE ON THE VERGE
OF A DECISION TO PURCHASE DEEP PENETRATION STRIKE AIRCRAFT
FROM THE WEST.
B. AFGHANISTAN
106. INTERNAL SITUATION. THE TARAKI REGIME CONTINUES ITS
EFFORTS TO CONSOLIDATE ITS CONTROL BOTH IN KABUL AND THE
COUNTRYSIDE. THE PURGE OF PARCHAMISTS BEGUN IN JUNE
APPEARS TO BE CONTINUING WITH RECENT DEVELOPMENTS INCLUDING THE SACKING OF SIX PARCHAM AMBASSADORS AND THE RESHUFFLING OF PERSONNEL IN KABUL. AMONG THESE WERE
AMBASSADOR TO WASHINGTON NOOR AHMAD NOOR AND PARCHAM
LEADER BABRAK KARMAL. WE HAVE REPORTS OF TRIBAL OPPOSITION INLCUDING ARMED RESISTANCE PARTICULARLY IN THE EASTERN PROVINCES OF AFGHANISTAN. SO FAR, THE DEMOCRATIC
REPUBLIC OF AFGHANISTAN (DRA) APPEARS TO ENJOY THE CONTINUED LOYALTY OR AT LEAST ACQUIESCENCE OF THE MILITARY
BUT IT SEEMS THAT TARAKI HAS SERIOUSLY NARROWED THE BASE
OF HIS SUPPORT AND HENCE INCREASED THE IMPORTANCE OF A
SOVIET PROP TO HIS GOVERNMENT. AT THE SAME TIME, DEPUTY
PRIME MINISTER AND FOREIGN MINISTER AMIN HAS EMERGED AS A
REAL POWER BEHIND THE THRONE APPARENTLY DERIVING HIS
STRENGTH FROM HIS ORGANIZATIONAL ABILITIES AND HIS CLOSE
TIES WITH THE AFGHAN MILITARY.
107. FOREIGN POLICY. THE DRA CONTINUES TO VOICE SUPPORT
FOR COOPERATIVE RELATIONS WITH ITS NEIGHBORS AND SAYS IT
WILL FOLLOW AN INDEPENDENT AND NON-ALIGNED POLICY. THE

VISITED KABUL AND MET WITH TARAKI AND AMIN IN A CONSTRUCTIVE ATMOSPHERE ALTHOUGH REPORTELDY LITTLE OF SUBSTANCE
WAS DISCUSSED. INDIAN FOREIGN MINISTER VAJPAYEE WAS IN
KABUL SEPTEMBER AND HEARD AMIN PRAISE THE STATE OF INDOAFGHAN RELATIONS.

108. AFGHANISTAN'S RELATIONS WITH THE SOVIET UNION HAVE
GROWN SIGNIFICANTLY CLOSER SINCE THE APRIL COUP, AND THERE
HAS BEEN A CONTINUING LEFTWARD SHIFT IN AFGHAN FOREIGN
POLICY POSITIONS (SUCH AS THE BREAKING OF RELATIONS WITH
THE REPUBLIC OF KOREA AND SUPPORT FOR THE IRAQI/CUBAN RESOLUTION ON PUERTO RICO IN THE COMMITTEE OF 24). OVER
THIRTY AID AGREEMENTS HAVE BEEN SIGNED BETWEEN THE SOVIET
UNION AND AFGHANISTAN. ALTHOUGH MANY OF THESE WERE IN THE
PIPELINE BEFORE THE COUP, BOTH SIDES HAVE MOVED WITH GREAT
RAPIDITY TO FINALIZE AGREEMENTS. SOVIET ADVISERS IN AFGHANISTAN HAVE NOT ONLY INCREASED IN NUMBERS TO BETWEEN 2,500
AND 3,000 BUT THEIR INFLUENCE WITHIN THE DRA SEEMS ENHANCED. ALTHOUGH THE SOVIETS ARE PROBABLY NOT HAPPY WITH THE
SUDDENNESS WITH WHICH TARAKI HAS MOVED AGAINST HIS OPPONENTS, THEIR SUPPORT FOR TARAKI IS CONTINUING.
C. PAKISTAN
109. INTERNAL SITUATION. THE PRESENT MARTIAL LAW GOVERNMENT CAME TO POWER IN JULY 1977 WHEN GENERAL ZIA LED A
MILITARY COUP WHICH OVERTHREW FORMER PRIME MINISTER BHUTTO.
ON SEPTEMBER 16, 1978 GENERAL ZIA WAS SWORN IN AS PRESIDENT. NATIONAL ELECTIONS HAVE BEEN PROMISED FOR SOMETIME
PRIOR TO OCTOBER 1979.

110. BHUTTO, THOUGH IN JAIL, REMAINS A DOMINANT POLITICAL
FIGURE. HE HAS BEEN CHARGED AND CONVICTED IN THE LAHORE
COURT ON THE CHARGE OF CONSPIRACY TO MURDER A POLITICAL
OPPONENT IN 1973 AND IS APPEALING THE CONVICTION AND DEATH
SENTENCE TO THE SUPREME COURT OF PAKISTAN. IF THE SUPREME
COURT UPHOLDS BOTH THE VERDICT AND THE DEATH SENTENCE THEN
PRESIDENT ZIA WILL BE FORCED TO MAKE THE ULTIMATE DECISION
ON BHUTTO'S FATE. IN MAKING HIS DECISION, ZIA WILL HAVE
TO CONSIDER THE DOMESTIC POLITICAL IMPACT OF AN EXECUTION
AS WELL AS PROBABLE INTERNATIONAL REPERCUSSIONS.
111. FOREIGN AFFAIRS. PAKISTAN WAS SHAKEN BY THE AFGHAN
COUP AND BY THE RECENT UNREST IN IRAN. PAKISTAN NOW BELIEVES THAT AFGHANISTAN HAS BECOME A SATELLITE OF THE
SOVIET UNION,AND THAT THIS REPRESENTS A NEW AND MAJOR SECURITY THREAT. FACED WITH THIS SITUATION, PAKISTAN IS CONSIDERING WITHDRAWING FROM CENTO AND MAY BE SEEKING SOME
DEGREE OF ACCOMMODATION WITH THE NON-ALIGNED BLOC AND THE
SOVIET UNION. WE BELIEVE HOWEVER THAT PAKISTAN FOR THE
MOMENT HAS PROBABLY RESERVED ITS POSITION ON WITHDRAWING
FROM CENTO.

VI. SOVIET POLICY TOWARD ASIA
112. CHINA. CONTAINMENT OF CHINESE IDEOLOGICAL AND DIPLOMATIC INITIATIVES AND DEFENSE AGAINST CHINA'S POTENTIAL
MILITARY THREAT FORM THE BASIC TENETS OF SOVIET POLICY
TOWARD ASIA. IN RECENT MONTHS, MOSCOW HAS BEEN HIGHLY DISTURBED BY A NEW ASSERTIVENESS AND FLEXIBILITY IN PEKING'S
FOREIGN POLICY, AND THE PROSPECT OF IMPROVED CHINESE RELATIONS WITH THE US, AND WESTERN EUROPE. THIS CONCERN
WAS DRAMATICALLY HIGHLIGHTED BY AN AUGUST 26 POLITBURO
STATEMENT WHICH CHARGED THAT CHINA WAS TRYING TO GAIN
ACCESS TO NATO ARSENALS AND IMPLIED THAT ARMS SALES TO
CHINA WOULD DESTROY CHANCES FOR A NEW STRATEGIC ARMS LIMICONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL

TATION AGREEMENT.
113. DESPITE A VIRULENT PROPAGANDA CAMPAIGN,THE SOVIETS
HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO PREVENT CHAIRMAN HUA'S WARM RECEPTION
IN EASTERN EUROPE, NORTH KOREA'S PRESENT &quot;TILT&quot; TOWARD
PEKING, THE SIGNING OF THE PEACE AND FRIENDSHIP TREATY WITH
JAPAN, OR CHINA'S MILITARY SUPPORT FOR CAMBODIA AND IT;
CONTINUING PRESSURE ON VIETNAM. IN THE FACE OF PEKING'S
CURRENT DIPLOMATIC OFFENSIVE, THE SOVIETS HAVE APPEARED
NOT ONLY INEFFECTUAL, BUT ALSO OUTMANEUVERED BY THE CHINESE.
114. THE SOVIETS APPARENTLY SEE LITTLE PROSPECT FOR IMPROVING SINO-SOVIET RELATIONS. AS A RESULT, THEY WILL TRY TO
MAINTAIN THE PRESENT LEVEL IN STATE-TO-STATE RELATIONS
AND WORK TO COUNTER CHINESE ANTI-SOVIET ACTIVITIES. MILITARILY, THE SOVIETS WILL MAINTAIN SUPERIOR FORCES ON THE
CHINESE BORDER IN ORDER TO DEAL EXPEDITIOUSLY WITH ANY
CHALLENGE. AT AN APPROPRIATE TIME NEXT YEAR, MOSCOW WILL
PROBABLY AGAIN ASK FOR A RECONVENING OF THE BORDER NEGOTIATIONS, BUT WITH LITTLE REAL HOPE THAT THE CHINESE WILL BE
INTERESTED IN MAING PROGRESS.
115. DURING TALKS WITH THE JAPANESE, TENG HSIAO-P'ING
ANNOUNCED THAT CHINA WILL INFORM THE SOVIETS OF ITS INTENTION TO ABROGATE THE SINO-SOVIET TREATY OF ALLIANCE IN
APRIL NEXT YEAR. WHEN THIS OCCURS, MOSCOW WILL PORTRAY IT
AS ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF PEKING'S ANTI-SOVIET POLICY, BUT
WILL ATTEMPT TO PLAY DOWN ITS PRACTICAL SIGNIFICANCE.
116. JAPAN. SOVIET REACTION TO THE CONCLUSION OF THE
SINO-JAPANESE PEACE AND FRIENDSHIP TREATY (PFT), WHICH INCONFIDENTIAL

PAGE 45

STATE 256102

CLUDES AN ANTI-HEGEMONY CLAUSE AIMED BY PEKING AT MOSCOW,
HAS BEEN CRITICAL BUT RESTRAINED. IN HIS FIRST MEETING WITH
A JAPANESE DELEGATION AFTER THE SIGNING, PREMIER KOSYGIN
STRONGLY CRITICIZED THE TREATY, BUT INDICATED THAT MOSCOW
WANTED TO MAINTAIN GOOD RELATIONS, ESPECIALLY IN THE ECONOMIC SPHERE. KOSYGIN'S REMARKS COUPLED WITH EARLIER SOVIET
STATEMENTS THAT JAPANESE INTENTIONS WOULD BE JUDGED BY
ACTIONS NOT WORDS INDICATE THE SOVIETS WILL LIMIT THEIR
REACTION TO THE TREATY. MOSCOW COULD RETALIATE,HOWEVER,
BY DELAYING SOME POLITICAL VISITS AND POSTPONING FINAL
AGREEMENT ON JOINT FISHING VENTURES.
117. THE SOVIETS HAVE TRADITIONALLY RELIED ON A COMBINATION
OF POLITICAL TOUGHNESS, MILITARY SUPERIORITY AND ECONOMIC
INCENTIVES IN DEALING WITH THE JAPANESE. THEY CAN NOW BE
EXPECTED TO RENEW THEIR INSISTENCE THAT JAPAN BALANCE THE
CHINESE PFT BY SIGNING A &quot;GOOD NEIGHBOR TREATY&quot; WITH MOSCOW. THEY WILL ALSO PUSH FOR AN INCREASE IN TRADE AND
ENCOURAGE EXPANDED JAPANESE PARTICIPATION IN SIBERIAN
DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS. ANY REAL IMPROVEMENT IN SOVIETJAPANESE POLITICAL RELATIONS, WILL BE PREVENTED,HOWEVER,
BY THE SOVIETS' CONTINUED REFUSAL TO DISCUSS THE RETURN
OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORIES, FOUR NORTHERN ISLANDS OCCUPIED
SINCE THE END OF WORLD WAR II.
118. KOREA. THE SOVIET UNION'S ONCE WARM RELATIONSHIP
WITH NORTH KOREA HAS COOLED SIGNIFICANTLY. KIM IL-SONG
HAS NOT VISITED MOSCOW SINCE 1961. THE SOVIETS HAVE NOT
DELIVERED MAJOR ITEMS OF MILITARY EQUIPMENT FOR SEVERAL
YEARS. FOLLOWING CHAIRMAN HUA'S HIGHLY SUCCESSFUL VISIT
TO PYONGYANG, NORT- KOREA HAS REBROADCAST CHINESE STATEMENTS CRITICIZING THE USSR AND NOW APPEARS ON THE VERGE
OF OPENLY SUPPORTING PEKING'S POSITION IN THE SINO-SOVIET
DISPUTE.
CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL
PAGE 46

STATE 256102

119. POSSIBLY IN RESPONSE TO THIS NORTH KOREAN &quot;TILT&quot;
TOWARD CHINA, MOSCOW HAS PERMITTED SOME LOW-LEVEL CONTACTS
WITH SOUTH KOREANS AND HAS TAKEN THE UNUSUAL STEP OF PERMITTING THE ROK HEALTH MINISTER TO ATTEND A UN CONFERENCE
IN THE SOVIET UNION. THIS HAS TOUCHED OFF PRESS SPECULATION
IN SEOUL ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF FURTHER CONTACTS BETWEEN
THE ROK AND THE SOVIETS.

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014

120. AS A PRACTICAL MATTER THE SOVIETS WOULD GAIN LITTLE
BY PUSHING THE NORTH KOREANS FURTHER INTO THE CHINESE
EMBRACE. THERE ARE INDICATIONS THAT KIM IL-SONG MAY BE
INVITED TO VISIT MOSCOW LATER THIS YEAR, A SOVIET INITIATIVE WHICH WOULD HELP RESTORE NORTH KOREA'S TRADITIONAL
BALANCE IN ITS RELATIONS WITH THE PRC AND THE USSR.
121. SOUTHEAST ASIA. SOVIET POLICY TOWARD SOUTHEAST ASIA
IS LARGELY DETERMINED BY ITS RELATIONSHIP WITH VIETNAM,
THE ONLY STATE WITH WHICH IT ENJOYS CLOSE RELATIONS IN REGION. AFTER FIRING A PROPAGANDA BARRAGE AT THE OUTSET OF
THE VIETNAM-CAMBODIAN CONFLICT, THE SOVIETS HAVE COME TO
TREAT THE INDOCHINA CONFLICT IN A RELATIVELY LOW-KEY MANNER. THERE MAY HAVE BEEN SOME INCREASE IN SOVIET PRESENCE
AND ASSISTANCE TO VIETNAM, BUT MOSCOW HAS BEEN CAREFUL NOT
TO PROVOKE PEKING INTO TAKING MILITARY ACTION AGAINST
HANOI.
122. WHILE PROVIDING PROPAGANDA SUPPORT AGAINST CHINA, THE
SOVIETS HAVE ENDORSED VIETNAMESE EFFORTS TO IMPROVE RELATIONS WITH THE ASEAN STATES, SUPPORTED A VIETNAMESE ZONE
OF PEACE INITIATIVE, AND ENCOURAGED HANOI TO SEEK BETTER
RELATIONS WITH THE US. THE SOVIETS APPEAR TO BE SENSITIVE
TO VIETNAMESE DESIRES TO PRESERVE THEIR INDEPENDENCE. THEY
PROBABLY DO NOT EXPECT THE VIETNAMESE TO PERMIT A SOVIET
CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL
PAGE 47

STATE 256102

NAVAL PRESENCE AND HAVE NOT PUSHED FOR A CLOSER RELATIONSHIP THAN HANOI IS WILLING TO ACCEPT. THE SOVIETS MAY SEE
IMPROVED VIETNAMESE-ASEAN RELATIONS AS PROVIDING OPPORTUNITIES FOR GREATER SOVIET CONTACT WITH ITS MEMBER STATES.
123. DESPITE MOSCOW'S MORE POSITIVE VIEW OF ASEAN, THE
NON-COMMUNIST COUNTRIES IN SOUTHEAST ASIA REMAIN HIGHLY
SUSPICIOUS OF SOVIET INTENTIONS, AND PERCEIVE A GENERALIZED COMMUNIST THREAT TO THEIR SECURITY. SOVIET OPTIONS
ARE SEVERELY LIMITED BY SUCH FEARS AND THE AREA'S TRADITIONAL PRO-WESTERN ORIENTATION.
124. SOVIET MILITARY PRESENCE. SOVIET MILITARY PRESENCE IN
ASIA IS COMPOSED OF LARGE, WELL-EQUIPPED LAND, AIR AND
MISSILE FORCES ON THE CHINESE FRONTIER AND THE SOVIET
PACIFIC FLEET BASED PRIMARILY AT VLADIVOSTOK AND PETROPAVLOVSK. SOVIET LAND FORCES ARE PRIMARILY COMMITTED TO
DEFENSE AGAINST CHINA. THE PACIFIC FLEET'S PRINCIPAL MISSION IS TO LAUNCH BALLISTIC-MISSILE STRIKES AGAINST THE
US, OPPOSE US NAVAL FORCES IN THE NORTHWEST PACIFIC AND,
INCREASINGLY, TO DEMONSTRATE SOVIET POWER IN THE REGION.

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014

IT HAS A LARGE NUMBER OF VESSELS, BUT IS QUALITATIVELY
INFERIOR TO OTHER SOVIET FLEETS. IN THE PAST FIVE YEARS
ITS CAPABILITY HAS DRAMATICALLY INCREASED.
125. ALTHOUGH SOVIET PACIFIC FORCES NORMALLY OPERATE CLOSE
TO HOME WATERS, THEY HAVE CONDUCTED EXERCISES IN THE
PHILIPPINE SEA AND REGULARLY PROVIDE ELEMENTS FOR THE
INDIAN OCEAN SQUADRON. THE INCREASE IN THE SIZE OF THE
SOVIET FLEET IS PERCEIVED BY ALL STATES IN THE REGION AS A
POTENTIAL THREAT TO THEIR SECURITY. NOW ABLE TO OPERATE
THROUGHOUT ASIA, THE SOVIETS CAN BE EXPECTED TO INCREASE
THEIR REQUESTS FOR PORT CALLS AND TO FIND OTHER MEANS OF
ADVERTISING THEIR INCREASED NAVAL PRESENCE.

126. SOUTH ASIA. SINCE THE APRIL 1978 COUP WHICH BROUGHT
NUR MOHAMMED TARAKI'S LEFTIST GOVERNMENT TO POWER, SOVIET
INTEREST IN THE ASIAN SUB-CONTINENT HAS FOCUSSED ON
AFGHANISTAN. WHILE THE SOVIETS WERE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR
TARAKI'S TAKEOVER, THEY MOVED SWIFTLY TO RECOGNIZE THE NEW
REGIME AND TO PROVIDE POLITICAL, ECONOMIC AND MILITARY
SUPPORT. LARGE NUMBERS OF SOVIET &quot;ADVISORS&quot; HAVE ASSUMED
POSITIONS IN KABUL'S MINISTERIES, AND ARMED FORCES. A
NUMBER OF NEW ECONOMIC AGREEMENTS HAVE BEEN SIGNED, AND
SOVIET MILITARY ASSISTANCE HAS INCREASED.
127. AFGHANISTAN'S LEADERS HAVE DENIED THEY ARE COMMUNISTS
AND HAVE ANNOUNCED THEIR INTENTION TO MAINTAIN THE COUNTRY'S TRADITIONAL NON-ALIGNED POLICY. HOWEVER, TARAKI,
AND HIS PRINCIPAL ASSOCIATE FOREIGN MINISTER AMIN, HAVE
ADOPTED MARXIST RHETORIC AND ARE PURSUING POLICIES WHICH
CAN ONLY INCREASE THEIR RELIANCE ON SOVIET SUPPORT. INCREASED AFGHAN IDENTITY WITH THE &quot;SOCIALIST CAMP&quot; AND ITS
REVIVAL OF THE PUSHTUNISTAN AND BALUCHISTAN ISSUES HAS
UNSETTLED RELATIONS WITH PAKISTAN AND IRAN, AND RAISED
QUESTIONS ABOUT THE STABILITY OF THE ENTIRE REGION.
128. IN THE SHORT TERM, THE SOVIETS WILL PROBABLY BE MORE
INTERESTED IN ASSISTING THE NEW GOVERNMENT TO REMAIN IN
POWER AND TO ESTABLISH ITS CONTROL OVER THE ENTIRE COUNTRY THAN IN SUPPORTING AFGHAN &quot;IRREDENTISM&quot; OR IN EXPANDING THEIR OWN PRESENCE THROUGHOUT THE REGION. WHILE IN
THE LONG RUN, A RADICAL, SOVIET-SUPPORTED AFGHANISTAN
COULD POSE A SECURITY THREAT TO NEIGHBORING STATES,
SOVIET POLICY, AT LEAST IN THE LAST DECADE, HAS AIMED
AT REGIONAL STABILITY.

129. PAKISTAN/INDIA. IMPROVEMENT OF SOVIET RELATIONS
WITH PAKISTAN WILL CONTINUE TO BE RESTRAINED BY MOSCOW'S
INTEREST IN MAINTAINING ITS TRADITIONALLY POSITIVE TIES
WITH INDIA. ALTHOUGH SOVIET-INDIAN RELATIONS HAVE COOLED
SINCE THE BALMY DAYS OF INDIRA GANDHI'S ADMINISTRATION,
THE SOVIETS REMAIN INDIA'S PRINCIPAL ARMS SUPPLIER AND
ENJOY THE BENEFITS OF A STABLE RELATIONSHIP WITH THE
MAJOR STATE IN THE SUB-CONTINENT. RECENTLY, NEW DELHI
HAS SHOWN AN INTEREST IN DIVERSIFYING ITS SOURCES OF
WEAPONS, PARTICULARLY AIRCRAFT, AND IN IMPROVING ITS
RELATIONS WITH PEKING. HOWEVER, IT IS DOUBTFUL THE
INDIANS WILL WANT TO RISK SERIOUSLY UNDERMINING WHAT HAS
BEEN A MUTUALLY BENEFICIAL ASSOCIATION WITH THE SOVIETS. VANCE

A. INTERNAL POLITICS
1. A LITTLE MORE THAN A YEAR HAS PASSED SINCE THE REHABILITATION OF TENG HSIAO-PING, WHOSE PRAGMATIC POLICIES, PARTICULARLY IN THE AREA OF ECONOMIC RELATIONS WITH OTHER COUNTRIES, APPEAR TO HAVE BECOME FIRMLY ENTRENCHED. DESPITE
SOME SIGNS OF TENSION WITHIN THE LEADERSHIP, A SENSE OF

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
HISTORICAL RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF CHINA'S
ECONOMY AND FOR THE RESTORATION OF CHINA TO ITS &quot;RIGHTFUL
PLACE&quot; IN THE WORLD, AS WELL AS THE INABILITY OF ANY SINGLE
LEADER TO ACHIEVE DOMINANCE SHOULD HOLD THE LEADERSHIP TOGETHER, AT LEAST FOR THE TIME BEING.
2. THE TENG ASCENDANCY. OVER THE PAST MONTHS THE CHINESE
GOVERNMENT HAS: MOVED TO OVERHAUL THE EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM,
WITH A RETURN TO EMPHASIS ON ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE; DECIDED
TO SEND THOUSANDS OF STUDENTS ABROAD FOR ACADEMIC TRAINING; IMPLEMENTED A PROGRAM OF MATERIAL INCENTIVES TO IMPROVE PRODUCTIVITY; BEGUN A SHIFT TO A MODERNIZED,MORE
PROFESSIONAL ARMY; BEGUN TO DETERMINE MEANS BY WHICH
COOPERATION WITH FOREIGN COMPANIES IN EXPLOITING CHINA'S
NATURAL RESOURCES MIGHT BE ACCOMPLISHED; APPROVED THE
EXPANDED USE OF CREDITS TO FACILITATE THE IMPORTATION OF
WESTERN TECHNOLOGY. MANY OF THESE MOVES WOULD HAVE SEEMED
IMPOSSIBLE AS RECENTLY AS TWO YEARS AGO, AND ALL OF THEM
ARE, TO A CONSIDERABLE DEGREE, ASSOCIATED WITH TENG HSIAOPING.
3. KEY APPOINTMENTS IN THE CHINESE POLICY APPARATUS HAVE
GIVEN TENG A FIRM GRIP ON SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY MATTERS
AND STRONG INFLUENCE ON RELATED BUDGETARY, EDUCATION, AND
TRADE MATTERS. HE DOMINATES MILITARY REORGANIZATION
CONFIDENTIAL

PAGE 03

STATE 256102

EFFORTS AND HAS MADE GAINS IN PROPAGANDA, PARTY, AND
SECURITY MATTERS.
4. CONTROL OVER CULTURE, EDUCATION, AND THE MEDIA, HOWEVER, REMAINS DIVIDED BETWEEN THOSE LOYAL TO TENG AND
THOSE IDENTIFIED WITH CHAIRMAN HUA KUO-FENG. PARTY AND
SECURITY MATTERS, AS WELL, ARE STRONGLY INFLUENCED BY
HUA AND HIS SUPPORTERS, VICE CHAIRMAN WANG TUNG-HSING AND
POLITBURO MEMBER CHI TENG-KUEI. AS HEAD OF PARTY SECURITY, WANG, FOR INSTANCE, RETAINS CONTROL OF DOSSIERS AND
FILES, INCLUDING MAO'S PAPERS, AND THUS HAS A MAJOR VOICE
IN PURGES, REHABILITATIONS, AND THE WRITING OF PARTY
HISTORY.
5. WHAT DOES TENG WANT? IN ADDITION TO THEIR PRIMARY
GOAL OF MODERNIZING CHINA,ON WHICH A BASIC CONSENSUS EMBRACING ALL OF THE CENTRAL LEADERSHIP NOW SEEMS TO EXIST,
TENG AND HIS FOLLOWERS SEEK A VINDICATION OF THEIR EARLY
CAREER RECORDS, AT LEAST A PARTIAL REPUDIATION OF THE
CULTURAL REVOLUTION, AND A DESANCTIFICATION OF MAO. ON
THESE LAST THREE ISSUES THERE IS NO CONSENSUS AND TENG
AND HIS ASSOCIATES HAVE CONTINUED TO MANUEVER AGAINST

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
POLITBURO MEMBERS AND OTHERS ONCE ASSOCIATED WITH THE
&quot;GANG OF FOUR&quot; AND THE EFFORT TO PREVENT TENG'S 1977 REHABILITATION.
6. TENG HAS BEEN LIKE A STEAMROLLER, RELENTLESSLY PRESSING FORWARD. WITH DETERMINATION, BOLDNESS, AND WELLPLACED, TIMELY SUPPORT FROM HIS LIEUTENANTS IN THE PROPAGANDA AND MEDIA FIELDS, HE HAS LARGELY SUCCEEDED IN
GETTING HIS WAY. HE PROMISES TO BECOME THE PRIMARY INTERPRETER OF MAO'S THOUGHTS. HE HAS SKILLFULLY USED SUCH
EARLY THEORETICAL WORKS OF MAO AS &quot;ON PRACTICE,&quot; THE
1944 SPEECH &quot;ON THE PROBLEM OF POLITICAL WORK FOR ARMYMEN,&quot; AND THE 1962 SPEECH TO THE ENLARGED WORK CONFERENCE
CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL
PAGE 04

STATE 256102

WHICH SUPPORTED HIS THEN MODERATE APPROACH AND POLICIES.
7. WITH INCREASING SUCCESS, TENG AND HIS ALLIES HAVE
OVERCOME THE CONTENTION THAT THE EXAMINATION OF CHINA'S
RECENT TROUBLES SHOULD STOP AT THE GANG OF FOUR ERA. THEY
HAVE USED THE MEDIA SKILLFULLY TO PAINT A DARK PICTURE OF
THE CULTURAL REVOLUTION AND TO BUILD SYMPATHY FOR ITS
VICTIMS, I.E. THEMSELVES.
8. WITH SOMEWHAT LESS SUCCESS, TENG, WEI KUO-CHING, AND
OTHER PLA LEADERS CLOSE TO TENG, HAVE KEPT UP PRESSURE
ON THOSE PLA LEADERS WHO ROSE UNDER THE PATRONAGE OF
LIN PIAO. THE MOST PROMINENT MEMBERS OF THIS GROUP ARE
CHEN HSI-LIEN AND LI TE-SHENG, GENERALLY CONSIDERED TO BE
TWO OF HUA KUO-FENG'S CLOSEST ALLIES. AT THE RECENT PLA
POLITICAL WORK CONFERENCE, HUA AND VICE-CHAIRMAN YEH CHIENYING TOOK POSITIONS IN OPPOSITION TO TENG ON THE QUESTION
OF WHETHER OR NOT ADHERENTS OF LIN PIAO HAD BEEN CLEANED
OUT OF THE PLA. BUT, SUCH RECENT EVIDENCE AS THE PURGE
OF LIN PIAO SUPPORTERS IN THE CANTON MILITARY REGION
SUGGESTS THAT TENG MAY BE GETTING HIS WAY ON THIS ISSUE
AS WELL.
9. TENG AND HIS ALLIES ARE ALSO CONTINUING THEIR EFFORTS
TO WEAKEN THE BENEFICIARIES OF THE CULTURAL REVOLUTION
AT THE CENTER AND IN THE PROVINCES. PEKING PARTY FIRST
SECRETARY AND POLITBURO MEMBER WU TE, IN PARTICULAR,
HAS BEEN THE TARGET OF A CONTINUING CAMPAIGN. AT OTHER
TIMES THE TENG FORCES SEEM TO HAVE AIMED VARIOUSLY AT
WANG TUNG-HSING, CHEN HSI-LIEN, AND LI TE-SHENG, THOUGH
ALL OF THESE SEEM TO BE FARING SOMEWHAT BETTER THAN WU
TE.

10. WHO IS IN OPPOSITION? THAT TENG HSIAO-PING IS THE
CUTTING EDGE OF THE MODERNIZATION DRIVE IS QUITE CLEAR;
JUST WHO BELONGS TO THE COALITION &quot;OPPOSING&quot; HIM AND PRECISELY WHAT THEY WANT IS SOMEWHAT LESS CLEAR.
11. IT MUST BE EMPHASIZED THAT THERE IS A BASIC CONSENSUS AMONG ALL THE CENTRAL LEADERSHIP FIGURES ON THE
IDEA OF MODERNIZATION; DIFFERENCES ARISE OVER POWER AND
PERSONALITY, METHODS TO ACHIEVE GOALS, AND, PERHAPS, OVER
JUST WHAT &quot;MODERNIZATION&quot; MEANS.
12. WU TE, WANG TUNG-HSING, CHEN HSI-LIEN, AND LI TESHENG, AS CONSPICUOUS OFFICE HOLDERS AS WELL AS BENEFICIARIES OF THE CULTURAL REVOLUTION, HAVE ALL BEEN TARGETS
AT ONE TIME OR ANOTHER OF TENG AND/OR HIS FOLLOWERS. FOR
REASONS OF SHEER SELF-PRESERVATION THEY HAVE ALL AT VARIOUS TIMES BEEN IDENTIFIED WITH OPPOSITION TO TENG AND
HIS POLICIES.
13. ECONOMIC SPECIALIST LI HSIEN-NIEN, LONG REGARDED AS
AN ALLY OF TENG, MAY HAVE OPPOSED HIM ON SOME ISSUES
IN RECENT MONTHS. IT IS UNCLEAR, HOWEVER, WHETHER THIS
WAS DUE TO RESENTMENT OF TENG'S BULLDOZER TACTICS OR TO
INNATE CAUTION AND A FEELING THAT TENG WAS MOVING TOO
RAPIDLY.
14. WHILE THIS OPPOSITION IS MORE PERSONAL THAN IDEOLOGICAL, THE FAR-REACHING NATURE OF THE POLICY CHANGES
PURSUED BY TENG AND HIS FOLLOWERS HAS PRECIPITATED A
SERIOUS POLICY DEBATE AT THE CENTER. THIS DEBATE WAS
EVIDENT IN THE CONFLICTING LINES TAKEN BY HUA AND TENG
IN THE SPEECHES EACH GAVE AT THE CONFERENCE ON SCIENCE
AND TECHNOLOGY AND POLITICAL WORK IN THE PLA. WHEREAS
TENG HAS WARNED AGAINST BLIND RELIANCE ON MARXISM-LENINISM

CONFIDENTIAL
PAGE 06

STATE 256102

FROM FACTS,&quot; HUA HAS CONTINUED TO EMPHASIZE THE IMPORTANCE
OF IDEOLOGICAL RECTITUDE AND THE CORRECTNESS OF THE CULTURAL REVOLUTION POLICIES BASED ON EGALITARIANISM. THOUGH
SHARING THE BELIEF THAT THE DESTRUCTIVE POLICIES OF THE
CULTURAL REVOLUTION ERA MUST BE REPLACED WITH MEASURES
RESTORING DISCIPLINE AND ECONOMIC GROWTH, HUA AND OTHERS
APPEAR TO BE CONCERNED THAT TENG AND HIS FOLLOWERS ARE

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
PUSHING THE PRC TOO FAST IN SEEKING TO EFFECT THESE GOALS.
15. IT IS LIKELY THAT EDUCATIONAL POLICY ALSO STIMULATED
A LIVELY DEBATE REVOLVING AROUND SUCH ISSUES AS: THE
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN COMMUNISM'S EGALITARIAN PROMISE
AND ELITISM IN THE SERVICE OF RAPID MODERNIZATION; HOW TO
PREVENT THE EMERGENCE OF A BUREAUCRATIC AND INTELLECTUAL
&quot;NEW CLASS;&quot; AND HOW TO COPE WITH THE HUGE NUMBER OF DISADVANTAGED YOUTH WHO FEEL THEIR PATH HAS NOW BEEN CLOSED
BY THE NEW ELITIST POLICIES.
,6. THERE ALSO APPEARS TO BE CONSIDERABLE DEBATE ABOUT
SUCH MILITARY RELATED ISSUES AS POLITICAL CONTROL OVER
THE PLA, THE CONTINUED RELEVANCE OF THE &quot;PEOPLES WAR&quot;
CONCEPT IN A TECHNOLOGICAL AGE, AND THE STRATEGIC IMPORTANCE OF THE MILITIA.
17. BEYOND THE DEBATE AT THE CENTER, MANY PROVINCIAL
AND LOCAL PARTY OFFICIALS AND CADRES CONTINUE TO OPPOSE
PASSIVELY THE IMPLEMENTATION OF SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC
REFORMS. WHILE SOME OF THIS OPPOSITION APPEARS TO BE
BASED ON GENUINE CONVICTION, MUCH OF IT IS PROBABLY FOOTDRAGGING,STEMMING FROM A FEAR OF BEING CAUGHT ONCE AGAIN
IN A RADICAL BACKLASH. HALF OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY'S
THIRTY-FIVE MILLION MEMBERS JOINED AFTER THE BEGINNING OF
THE CULTURAL REVOLUTION AND SEVEN MILLION SINCE THE 10TH
CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL
PAGE 07

STATE 256102

PARTY CONGRESS IN 1973, THE TWO PERIODS OF GREATEST RADICAL STRENGTH. MANY OF THESE PEOPLE MUST FEEL THREATENED
BY THE ANTI-CULTURAL REVOLUTION DRIVE. FURTHER, THE
CENTRAL LEADERSHIP HAS MADE IT CLEAR THAT IT INTENDS TO
RELY ON VETERAN CADRES, WHO ARE OFTEN CULTURAL REVOLUTION
REHABILITEES, TO CARRY OUT ITS POLICIES. AS A RESULT,
YOUNGER OFFICIALS PROBABLY SEE LITTLE OPPORTUNITY FOR
CAREER ADVANCEMENT AND COULD, IN TIME, BECOME DISAFFECTED.
18. HUA'S ROLE. IT SEEMS CLEAR THAT HUA-KUO-FENG WOULD
PREFER TO REMAIN ALOOF FROM THE BATTLE AS A SYMBOL OF
UNITY. HIS ROLE HAS, THEREFORE, BEEN AMBIVALENT. AS
MAO'S PRINCIPAL LEGATEE, AND AS A PROMINENT BENEFICIARY
OF THE CULTURAL REVOLUTION, AND ONE CLOSELY ASSOCIATED
WITH MANY OF THE OTHER CENTRAL LEADERS WHO HAVE SOMETIMES
BEEN SEEN AS BEING IN OPPOSITION TO TENG, HUA MAY HAVE
FOUND IT UNAVOIDABLE ON OCCASION TO ACT AS SPOKESMAN
FOR THE OPPOSITION. AT THE SAME TIME HIS SPEECH TO THE
JULY FINANCE AND TRADE CONFERENCE INDICATES THAT HE HAS
ALSO PROVIDED IMPORTANT SUPPORT FOR TENG'S POLICIES.
19. THIS PROBABLY REFLECTS THE FACT THAT, DESPITE AN

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
IMPRESSIVE ARRAY OF TITLES (CHAIRMAN OF THE PARTY, PREMIER
AND COMMANDER IN CHIEF OF THE ARMY), HUA SIMPLY DOES NOT
HAVE THE POWER BASE TO CHALLENGE TENG EFFECTIVELY.
FURTHER, AS A JUNIOR MEMBER OF THE GERONTOCRACY, HUA (56)
DOES NOT NEED TO HURRY. HE HAS, THEREFORE, ADOPTED A
POLICY WHICH STRESSES UNITY IN AN EFFORT TO PRESERVE THE
PRESENT EQUILIBRIUM, WHILE CAUTIOUSLY ATTEMPTING TO PROTECT SOME OF HIS KEY ASSOCIATES WHO WERE TAINTED BY THE
CULTURAL REVOLUTION.
20. THE FUTURE. TENG HSIAO-PING IS AN IMPATIENT MAN
BY NATURE AND HE KNOWS HIS EFFECTIVE WORKING YEARS ARE
LIMITED. ON THE BASIS OF RESULTS SO FAR, HE SHOULD BE
PLEASED. HIS POLICIES ARE PREVAILING AND HIS ALLIES

NOW OCCUPY MANY KEY POSITIONS THROUGHOUT THE STATE, MILITARY AND PARTY APPARATUS.
21. THE DANGER FOR TENG LIES IN THE HASTE WITH WHICH HE
HAS MOVED IN ATTACKING FORMERLY SACROSANCT MAOIST IDEALS.
THERE HAVE BEEN PAST PERIODS OF REFORM AND TURNING TO
THE OUTSIDE WORLD IN CHINESE HISTORY, BUT THE XENOPHOBIC
&quot;BOXER&quot; TENDENCY RUNS DEEP IN CHINESE SOCIETY. THERE ARE
MANY WHOSE VESTED INTERESTS AND DEEPLY HELD BELIEFS ARE
BEING CHALLENGED BY THE RAPID DEPARTURE FROM THE PRINCIPLES OF THE OLD REGIME. AT PRESENT, THESE INDIVIDUALS
ARE BEING HELD IN CHECK BY THE POPULAR REVULSION AGAINST
THE EXCESSES OF THE CULTURAL REVOLUTION.
22. IF TENG'S ECONOMIC REFORMS BEGIN TO SHOW AN ECONOMIC
PAYOFF, HOWEVER, THEY SHOULD DEVELOP A MOMENTUM OF THEIR
OWN WHICH ANY ONE POLITICAL FIGURE WOULD FIND DIFFICULT
TO CHALLENGE. ON THE OTHER HAND, ECONOMIC SETBACKS,
PARTICULARLY IN THE CRITICAL AGRICULTURAL AREA, COULD
SEVERELY UNDERCUT TENG'S MODERNIZATION STRATEGY.
23. THE SUDDEN DEATH OF ANYONE OF THE KEY ACTORS - HUA,
TENG OR YEH CHIEN-YING - COULD UPSET THE PRESENT EQUILIBRIUM. TENG IN PARTICULAR SEEMS AWARE OF THIS, AND
PART OF HIS STRATEGY IN DESANCTIFYING MAO SEEMS TO BE
A DESIRE TO DEPRIVE HIS POTENTIAL SUCCESSORS OF IDEOLOGICAL UNDERPINNINGS FOR A SWING AWAY FROM HIS MODERATE
POLICIES AND TO SET CHINA ON A MODERNIZING PATH THAT
WILL OUTLIVE HIM.

TION. TENG IS TRYING TO STUFF THAT PARTICULAR GENIE
BACK IN THE BOTTLE; HIS SUCCESS OR FAILURE WILL DETERMINE
WHETHER THE CURRENT DRIVE TURNS INTO A LONG-TERM COMMITMENT.
B. THE ECONOMY
25. THE GOALS. THE POST-MAO LEADERSHIP HAS MADE CHOU
EN-LAI'S VISIONARY CALL FOR THE TRANSFORMATION OF CHINA
INTO A MODERN, POWERFUL, SOCIALIST STATE BY THE YEAR
2000 INTO ITS RAISON D'ETRE. ACHIEVING THIS OBJECTIVE
IS A FORMIDABLE TASK. PARTIALLY AS A RESULT OF THE LACK
OF MATERIAL INCENTIVES, LABOR PRODUCTIVITY IS VERY LOW.
KEY SECTORS SUCH AS COAL, TRANSPORTATION, AND ELECTRIC
POWER HAVE SUFFERED THROUGH PAST NEGLECT AND ARE BOTTLENECKS TO RAPID FUTURE GROWTH. FUTURE AGRICULTURAL PROGRESS
IS LIKELY TO REQUIRE HEAVY CAPITAL INVESTMENT.
, ; E TARGETS AND GOALS FOR THE NEXT EIGHT YEARS,
AS REVEALED AT THE FIFTH NATIONAL PEOPLES CONGRESS (NPC)
HELD EARLIER THIS YEAR, ARE AMBITIOUS AND INCLUDE:
ACHIEVEMENT OF 85 PER CENT MECHANIZATION OF AGRICULTURE,
WITH AGRICULTURAL OUTPUT TO INCREASE BY 4-5 PER CENT
EACH YEAR AND GRAIN PRODUCTION TO REACH 400 MMT ANNUALLY
BY THE END OF THE PERIOD (COMPARED WITH 280 MMT FOR 1977);
EXPANSION OF INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION AT AN ANNUAL RATE OF
10 PER CENT, WITH STEEL PRODUCTION MORE THAN DOUBLING
BY 1985; CONSOLIDATION OF THE ECONOMY THROUGH THE COMPLETION OF 120 LARGE INDUSTRIAL COMPLEXES AND THE ORGANIZATION OF'14 INDUSTRIAL BASES&quot; AND &quot;SIX ECONOMIC REGIONS;&quot;
A STRENGTHENING OF THE VERTICAL MANAGEMENT OF THE ECONOMY WITH GREATER CONTROL RETURNING TO THE CENTRAL AUTHORITIES; AND REDUCTION OF THE POPULATION INCREASE FROM THE
CURRENT ESTIMATED ANNUAL RATE OF 1.6 PER CENT TO LESS
THAN 1 PER CENT BY 1980.

27. THE MEANS. DISCIPLINE, ORGANIZATION, BUREAUCRATIC
CONTROL, AND FOREIGN TECHNOLOGY ARE THE KEY ELEMENTS
BY WHICH THE TENG INSPIRED LEADERSHIP HOPES TO ACHIEVE
ITS GOALS. THE LEADERSHIP PLANS TO REALIZE MAJOR SAVINGS
THROUGH BETTER ADMINISTRATION--IMPROVING THE PLANNING
APPARATUS, REDUCING CORRUPTION AND WASTE, TIGHTENING

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
COST-ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL PROCEDURES, VIGOROUSLY
INSTITUTING A SYSTEM OF ONE-MAN RESPONSIBILITY, REPLACING
&quot;REVOLUTIONARY COMMITTEES&quot; WITH MORE EFFICIENT MANAGEMENT
STRUCTURES, AND STRESSING HARD WORK FOR CIVIL SERVANTS,
FACTORY MANAGEMENT, AND ORDINARY WORKERS. INVESTMENT,
TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, WILL BE CHANNELED INTO PRIORITY
SECTORS SUCH AS AGRICULTURE, POWER, FUEL, RAW AND SEMIFINISHED MATERIALS, AND TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATIONS.
MATERIAL INCENTIVES WILL BE UPGRADED TO URGE INDUSTRIAL
WORKERS TO GREATER EFFORTS. IN THIS REGARD ABOUT HALF
OF CHINA'S INDUSTRIAL WORK FORCE RECEIVED A MODEST PAY
INCREASE LAST YEAR AND VARIOUS FORMS OF BONUSES, PIECEWORK REMUNERATION, AND OTHER SCHEMES TO PEG INCOME DIRECTLY TO OUTPUT HAVE BEEN OFFICIALLY SANCTIONED. SOME HAVE
ALREADY BEEN INTRODUCED IN A NUMBER OF INDUSTRIAL PLANTS.
PEASANTS ARE BEING PROMISED BETTER TERMS OF TRADE FOR
THEIR PRODUCTS AT THE SAME TIME THAT THEY ARE BEING EXHORTED TO INCREASE THEIR CONTRIBUTION TO &quot;BASIC CAPITAL
CONSTRUCTION&quot;--I.E., OFF-SEASON EFFORTS TO RECLAIM WASTELAND, CONSTRUCT IRRIGATION PROJECTS, LEVEL FIELDS, TERRACE HILLSIDES, ETC. STATE INVESTMENT WILL BE INCREASED
IN ORDER TO HASTEN MECHANIZATION AND FUND LARGE-SCALE
WATER CONTROL PROJECTS. FINALLY, A RELAXATION OF CHINA'S
TRADITIONAL POLICY OF &quot;SELF-RELIANCE&quot; IS INTENDED TO OBTAIN ACCESS TO WESTERN TECHNOLOGY AND FINANCE.
CONFIDENTIAL

PAGE 11

STATE 256102

28. THIS IS A TOUGH MINDED, SOLID PROGRAM BUT IT WILL
NOT BE EASY TO INSTITUTE. MILITARY MODERNIZATION AND
GRAIN IMPORTS WILL BE AMONG THE IMPORTANT SECTORS COMPETING FOR INVESTMENT WITH THE PRIORITY SECTORS OF THE
ECONOMY. INTRODUCING LABOR DISCIPLINE IN FACTORIES WHERE
THE WORKERS HAVE FOR YEARS BEEN TOLD TO &quot;STRUGGLE&quot; AGAINST
SUCH CAPITALISTIC PRACTICES WILL REQUIRE MORE THAN EXHORTATION. THE EFFECT OF LAST YEAR'S PAY RISE WILL BE RAPIDLY LOST IF FURTHER WAGE REFORM IS NOT SOON INSTITUTED.
FINALLY, ALLOWING FOREIGN TECHNOLOGY AND FOREIGN TECHNICIANS INTO CHINA WILL PRESENT NOT ONLY IDEOLOGICAL PROBLEMS BUT REAL PRACTICAL PROBLEMS INVOLVING THE COMPATIBILITY OF EXISTING CHINESE TECHNOLOGIES AND THE CHINESE
PEOPLE.
29. INDUSTRIAL PERFORMANCE. IN MANY RESPECTS THE PRC
INDUSTRIAL SECTOR IS ENJOYING THE MOST FAVORABLE CONDITIONS IT HAS KNOWN IN YEARS. THIS IS PARTICULARLY TRUE
WITH RESPECT TO THE POLICY ENVIRONMENT. A NEW CODIFICATION OF INDUSTRIAL POLICY CALLED THE &quot;30 POINTS&quot; SHOULD
SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE PRODUCTION AND EFFICIENCY IN THE

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
LONG RUN. THE HIGHER LEVELS OF ECONOMIC MANAGEMENT HAVE
BEEN STAFFED WITH EXPERIENCED CADRES. IMPROVED CENTRAL
CONTROL HAS BEEN MATCHED WITH A DECISION TO RETAIN LOCAL
ADMINISTRATION.
30. INFORMED OBSERVERS BELIEVE THAT THE GROS VALUE OF
INDUSTRIAL OUTPUT (GVIO) IN THE FIRST HALF OF 1978 ACHIEVED A NEW HALF YEAR RECORD AND A SUBSTANTIAL--15 PER CENT-GROWTH FOR ALL OF 1978 IS QUITE LIKELY. (IT SHOULD BE
REMEMBERED,HOWEVER,THAT 1977 WAS A RELATIVELY POOR YEAR.)
THE FOLLOWING IS A COMPARISON OF 1977 AND 1978 FIRST HALF
PRODUCTION RESULTS FOR SEVERAL KEY INDUSTRIES:
A. NEW CHINA NEWS AGENCY (NCNA) HAS CLAIMED THAT CRUDE
OIL PRODUCTION IS UP SOME 11.2 PER CENT, AND PROCESSING
CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL
PAGE 12

STATE 256102

IS UP 8.1 PER CENT. PETROLEUM PRODUCTION MAY BE DEVELOPING INTO A MEDIUM TERM BOTTLENECK. THERE ARE INDICATIONS
THAT GROWTH RATES IN PRODUCTION ARE LEVELING OFF OR EVEN
DECLINING, ALTHOUGH THIS MAY REFLECT CONSERVATION EFFORTS
BY THE CHINESE.
B. COAL OUTPUT ACCORDING TO NCNA IS UP 19.3 PER CENT.
THIS CREDITABLE PERFORMANCE PROBABLY REFLECTS SUCCESSES
IN RAISING WORKER PRODUCTIVITY AND IN IMPROVED EMPLOYMENT
OF EXISTING CAPITAL PLANT AFTER TWO BAD YEARS FOLLOWING
THE TANGSHAN EARTHQUAKE.
C. ELECTRIC OUTPUT ACCORDING TO NCNA INCREASED TO 17.7
PER CENT. MEDIA REPORTS, HOWEVER, CONTINUE TO INDICATE
THAT ELECTRIC SUPPLY IS STILL LESS THAN DEMAND. THE
PRESENT TRENDS,HOWEVER, SUGGESTS THAT THE ELECTRICITY
BOTTLENECK WILL NOT GROW SUBSTANTIALLY WORSE THIS YEAR.
D. STEEL PRODUCTION ACCORDING TO NCNA IS UP 66.9 PER
CENT. IT IS STILL FAR BELOW REQUIREMENTS, HOWEVER, AND
IMPORTS ARE AT RECORD LEVELS. THE CHINESE HAVE ADMITTED
THAT RECOVERY TO THE 1975 LEVEL OF PRODUCTION WILL NOT
BE REALIZED UNTIL NEXT YEAR.
E. CHEMICAL FERTILIZER IS REPORTED TO BE UP 47 PER CENT,
AND THE OUTLOOK IS FOR CONTINUED HIGH GROWTH.
F. LIGHT INDUSTRY PRODUCTION IS UP 20 PER CENT. 1977
WAS, HOWEVER, A BAD YEAR FOR THIS INDUSTRY, SO THE FIGURES
SUGGEST NORMAL, RATHER THAN EXCEPTIONAL, GROWTH.
G. RAIL-FREIGHT VOLUME GREW AT 22.4 PER CENT. DESPITE

STATE 256102

THE IMPROVEMENT, HOWEVER, RAILROADS STILL CONSTITUTE
A BOTTLENECK.
H. NCNA CLAIMED AN INCREASE OF 65.3 PER CENT IN PROFITS
REMITTED TO THE STATE, AN IMPRESSIVE FIGURE WHICH SUGGESTS
IMPROVEMENTS IN LABOR PRODUCTIVITY, BETTER ACCOUNTING,
MATERIALS MANAGEMENT, AND PERHAPS MOST IMPORTANT, IMPROVED USE OF CAPACITY.
31. AGRICULTURAL PERFORMANCE. TENTATIVE ESTIMATES ARE
THAT CHINA MAY ATTAIN AN 8 MILLION METRIC TON (2.9 PER
CENT) TO 13 MMT (4.6 PER CENT) INCREASE IN GRAIN PRODUCTION THIS YEAR. THIS INCREASE IS FAR SHORT OF EARLIER
OFFICIAL PLANNING. WHEAT IMPORTS, WHICH IN THE 1977/78
MARKETING YEAR (JULY/JUNE) TOTALED 8.5 MMT, ARE LIKELY
TO TOTAL AT LEAST 8.0 MMT FOR THE 1978/79 MARKETING
YEAR AND CONTINUE TO CONSTITUTE AN IMPORTANT DRAIN ON
FOREIGN EXCHANGE.
32. COTTON PRODUCTION HAS BEEN DISAPPOINTING FOR SEVERAL
YEARS AND LITTLE IMPROVEMENT IS EXPECTED THIS YEAR. IMPORTS ARE EXPECTED TO AT LEAST EQUAL THE 2 MILLION BALES
IMPORTED IN 1977/78.
33. EDIBLE OILS ARE IN SOMEWHAT BETTER SHAPE DUE TO A
40 PER CENT INCREASE IN THE PRODUCTION OF RAPESEED,
WHICH ACCOUNTS FOR APPROXIMATELY ONE THIRD OF CHINA'S
TOTAL EDIBLE OIL OUTPUT. STILL, ACCORDING TO CHINESE
SOURCES, PER CAPITA CONSUMPTION OF EDIBLE OILS IS ONLY
ABOUT 5.9 OUNCES PER MONTH, AND FOR THE SHORT TO MEDIUM
TERM THERE IS LITTLE PROSPECT FOR ANY IMPROVEMENT IN THIS
AUSTERE RATION.
34. SHORTFALLS IN AGRICULTURAL OUTPUT, WHETHER BECAUSE
OF WEATHER CONDITIONS OR POLICY PROBLEMS, CONTINUE TO BE
ONE OF THE MOST SERIOUS THREATS TO CHINA'S MODERNIZATION
CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL

STATE 256102

PLANS.
35. FOREIGN ECONOMIC POLICY. IN THE LAST TWO YEARS THE
PRC GOVERNMENT HAS GIVEN ALMOST UNPRECEDENTED ATTENTION
TO THE PIVOTAL ROLES OF FOREIGN TRADE AND TECHNOLOGY IN
AN EFFORT TO TRANSFORM CHINA'S ECONOMY. THE LEADERSHIP
HAS ENCOURAGED A MORE INNOVATIVE AND AGGRESSIVE APPROACH

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
TO WORLD TRADE AND HAS BEGUN TO IMPLEMENT NEW AND MORE
LIBERAL TRADE AND EXTERNAL FINANCIAL POLICIES. EXPORT
CONTRACTS HAVE BEEN CHARACTERIZED, FOR EXAMPLE, BY GREATER
CHINESE RESPONSIVENESS TO FOREIGN BUYERS' NEEDS, FLEXIBILITY IN PRICING, AND THE INCLUSION OF INTERNATIONAL
STANDARDS ON PATENTS, TRADEMARKS, AND COPYRIGHTS. THE PRC
HAS SIGNED AGREEMENTS WITH SEVERAL WESTERN COUNTRIES
DESIGNED TO FACILITATE TRADE AND IS CONSIDERING A WIDE
VARIETY OF LOAN ARRANGEMENTS WITH FOREIGN BANKS, THUS
DEPARTING FROM ITS FORMER PRACTICE OF RELYING SOLELY ON
SUPPLIERS' CREDITS TO FINANCE MAJOR CAPITAL PURCHASES.
36. THESE CHANGES ALONE, HOWEVER, WILL NOT BE ENOUGH
TO BRING ABOUT THE TECHNOLOGICAL PROGRESS THAT CHINA
NEEDS TO ACHIEVE ITS ECONOMIC GOALS. FURTHER MODIFICATIONS IN ALMOST ALL OF ITS FOREIGN ECONOMIC PRACTICES
ARE THUS UNDER CONSIDERATION AND, IN MANY CASES, WILL BE
ADOPTED. IN PARTICULAR, THE LEADERSHIP APPEARS CONVINCED
THAT RELAXATION OF CHINA'S TRADITIONAL POLICY OF &quot;SELFRELIANCE&quot; WOULD HELP EASE FINANCIAL CONSTRAINTS AND IMPROVE CHINA'S LIMITED ABILITY TO ABSORB WESTERN TECHNOLOGY.
37. DESPITE PEKING'S INCREASED FLEXIBILITY IN FOREIGN
ECONOMIC POLICY, FOREIGN OWNERSHIP REMAINS A VERY SENSITIVE ISSUE. THERE ARE INDICATIONS THAT PEKING WILL
ATTEMPT TO CHANNEL FOREIGN TECHNOLOGY INTO CHINA THROUGH
CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL
PAGE 15

STATE 256102

A MECHANISM OF &quot;JOINT STOCK COMPANIES&quot; IN HONG KONG AND
MACAO. A VARIETY OF BUSINESS AND TRADE RELATIONS MAY BE
TESTED IN THESE TWO AREAS RATHER THAN ON THE CHINESE MAINLAND-ITSELF. IN ANY CASE THERE CLEARLY ARE LIMITS TO
LIBERALIZATION, WHICH WILL BE TESTED AS THE NEW POLICIES
EVOLVE.
38. SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY. FACED WITH AN ACUTE SHORTAGE
OF SCIENTISTS AND TECHNICIANS, PARTLY OWING TO THE EXCESSES OF THE CULTURAL REVOLUTION, PEKING HAS PAID UNPRECEDENTED ATTENTION TO SCIENCE AND TO SCIENTISTS, IN RECENT
MONTHS. AMONG THE REFORMS WHICH HAVE BEEN OR ARE ABOUT
TO BE ADOPTED ARE: STRENGTHENING AND RECENTRALIZING
CHINA'S SCIENCE MANAGEMENT APPARATUS BY REVIVING LEADING
ADMINISTRATIVE ORGANIZATIONS AND RESEARCH INSTITUTES AND
INCREASING THE AUTHORITY OF SCIENTISTS; GIVING INTELLECTUALS BETTER TREATMENT BY REVERSING PAST NEGATIVE JUDGMENTS
AGAINST THEM, IMPROVING WORKING CONDITIONS, AND INCREASING
MATERIAL BENEFITS; STRESSING ACADEMIC STANDARDS IN ENTRANCE EXAMS AND COLLEGE CURRICULA; MAKING GREATER USE OF
FOREIGN EXPERTS, TECHNOLOGY, AND EQUIPMENT; AND DISPATCH-

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
ING THOUSANDS OF STUDENTS TO WESTERN COUNTRIES FOR COLLEGE, GRADUATE AND POST-GRADUATE TRAINING, PRIMARILY IN THE
SCIENCES.
39. THE FUTURE. AMBITIOUS AS CHINA'S MODERNIZATION GOALS
ARE, THEY CAN BE ACCOMPLISHED ONLY IF POLITICAL TURMOIL
CAN BE AVOIDED, IF SUCCESSIVE YEARS OF FAVORABLE AGRICULTURE WEATHER PREVAIL, AND IF CENTRALIZED PLANNING AND
CONTROL ARE NOT ALLOWED TO BE OVERLY OBTRUSIVE.
40. IT IS INTERESTING TO SPECULATE WHAT EFFECT SUCCESSFUL MODERNIZATION BY CHINA WOULD HAVE ON THE REST OF THE
WORLD. A 10 PER CENT ANNUAL GROWTH RATE DOUBLES REAL GNP
IN 7 YEARS, QUADRUPLES IT IN 14 YEARS, AND MULTIPLIES
CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL
PAGE 16

STATE 256102

IT BY 16 IN 28 YEARS. IF CHINA IS ABLE TO ACHIEVE A
SUSTAINED 10 PER CENT GROWTH RATE, CHINA WOULD ACHIEVE
JAPAN'S 1978 PER CAPITA GNP BY THE EARLY 21ST CENTURY.
FOR APPROXIMATELY 1 BILLION CHINESE THIS WOULD MEAN AN
ANNUAL GNP OF 5 TRILLION DOLLARS. THE PROSPECT OF 1
BILLION CHINESE CONSUMING ENERGY AND OTHER RESOURCES
AT APPROXIMATELY THE PER CAPITA RATE 100 MILLION JAPANESE
DO TODAY WILL PRESENT THE WORLD WITH UNPRECEDENTED PROBLEMS OF ACCOMMODATION.
C. FOREIGN AFFAIRS
41. THE OBJECTIVES OF CHINESE FOREIGN POLICY HAVE REMAINED CONSTANT OVER THE PAST HALF-YEAR, BUT PEKING HAS
PURSUED THESE GOALS WITH A NEW DYNAMISM AND PRAGMATISM.
STRENGTHENING CHINA'S SECURITY THROUGH A WORLD-WIDE ANTISOVIET CAMPAIGN CONTINUES TO RECEIVE TOP PRIORITY, CLOSELY FOLLOWED BY EFFORTS TO SPEED UP CHINA'S MODERNIZATION
THROUGH EXPANDED CONTACTS WITH JAPAN AND THE WEST. IN
TURN, BOTH OF THESE GOALS SERVE ANOTHER, THAT OF ACHIEVING
FOR CHINA ITS RIGHTFUL PLACE AS AN IMPORTANT ACTOR ON
THE WORLD STAGE.
42. A KEY FEATURE OF THIS VIGOROUS REAFFIRMATION OF WHAT
BEGAN IN THE EARLY SEVENTIES AS THE MAO-CHOU &quot;REVOLUTIONARY LINE IN FOREIGN POLICY&quot; HAS BEEN THE APPEARANCE OF
SENIOR CHINESE LEADERS ON VIRTUALLY EVERY CONTINENT.
MOST SPECTACULAR WAS CHAIRMAN HUA'S TRIUMPHANT FIRST
FORAY OUT OF ASIA, TO ROMANIA, YUGOSLAVIA AND IRAN.
43. THE MOST SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN TACTICS HAS BEEN
PEKING'S DECISION TO DEEMPHASIZE SELF-RELIANCE IN PURSUING

STATE 256102

THE LONG-STANDING GOAL OF MODERNIZATION. CHINESE DELEGATIONS INTERESTED IN STUDYING OR PURCHASING WESTERN PRODUCTS AND TECHNOLOGY HAVE POURED FORTH FROM PEKING, AND
A LARGE NUMBER OF SIMILAR FOREIGN DELEGATIONS HAVE VISITED
THE PRC. PEKING IS ALSO PLANNING TO SEND THOUSANDS OF
STUDENTS AT ALL LEVELS TO WESTERN COUNTRIES FOR EDUCATION
AND TRAINING. FINALLY, CHINA IS SERIOUSLY CONSIDERING
VARIOUS SCHEMES WHICH WOULD INVOLVE FOREIGNERS MUCH MORE
DIRECTLY IN CHINA'S ECONOMIC LIFE--INCLUDING BORROWING
FROM FOREIGN BANKS, PRODUCT COMPENSATION AGREEMENTS AND,
IN HONG KONG, EVEN JOINT STOCK VENTURES.
44. THIS SURGE IN ACTIVITY IS ALMOST CERTAINLY THE WORK
OF VICE-PREMIER TENG HSIAO-P'ING, AND INDICATES THAT HE
HAS ENOUGH SUPPORT WITHIN THE LEADERSHIP COALITION TO
IMPLEMENT THESE POLICIES. THERE IS PROBABLY FULL AGREEMENT ON OPPOSITION TO THE SOVIETS AND ON ENHANCING CHINA'S
GLOBAL PRESTIGE. ON THE OTHER HAND, THERE IS A DEEP
SUSPICION OF FOREIGN TIES THAT IS FIRMLY ROOTED IN CHINESE
HISTORY. THEREFORE, A REDUCTION IN THE INFLUENCE OF TENG
AND HIS SUPPORTERS COULD PRECIPITATE A RETURN TO A LESS
PRAGMATIC,MORE XENOPHOBIC LINE, ESPECIALLY CONCERNING
THE ECONOMIC ASPECTS OF THIS NEW APPROACH IN FOREIGN
POLICY.
45. THE OPEN BREAKS WITH ALBANIA AND VIETNAM (SEE BELOW
FOR DETAILS) DO NOT FIT NEATLY WITH THE DOMINANT THEMES
SKETCHED ABOVE. IN BOTH CASES PEKING DECIDED TO CLOSE
OPTIONS, ALMOST CERTAINLY FOR MANY YEARS TO COME, INSTEAD
OF EMPHASIZING COMMON INTERESTS AND DOWNPLAYING INCOMPATABILITIES. THIS STYLE, GENERALLY FLEXIBLE BUT DECISIVELY
RUTHLESS WHEN NECESSARY, AGAIN FURTHER SUGGESTS TENG'S
INFLUENCE IN FOREIGN POLICY.
46. USSR AND EASTERN EUROPE. SINO-SOVIET RELATIONS CONTINUE TO BE SEVERELY STRAINED. PEKING BELIEVES THAT MOSCONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL
PAGE 18

STATE 256102

COW POSES THE CHIEF THREAT TO ITS SECURITY AND THAT ANY
FLINCHING BY CHINA WILL BE EXPLOITED BY THE SOVIETS AS
A SIGN OF WEAKNESS. ALSO, IT IS PROBABLE THAT THE CURRENT
LEADERSHIP FINDS THIS THREAT A CONVENIENT ADDITIONAL
RATIONALE FOR CHINA'S RAPID MODERNIZATION. PEKING'S
HARD-NOSED ATTITUDE WAS EVIDENT IN ITS REJECTION OF MOSCOW'S OFFER, JUST PRIOR TO THE NPC IN FEBRUARY, TO NEGO-

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
TIATE GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF MUTUAL RELATIONS. CHINESE
LEADERS USED THIS OCCASION TO HARDEN THE CHINESE POSITION
BY STIPULATING THAT &quot;NORMALIZATION&quot; OF SINO-SOVIET
RELATIONS WAS DEPENDENT ON THE WITHDRAWAL OF SOVIET
TROOPS FROM MONGOLIA AND A DRAWDOWN OF SOVIET TROOP
STRENGTH ALONG THE BORDER TO THE LEVELS OF THE EARLY 60S.
THIS STIFFNESS WAS ALSO REFLECTED IN PEKING'S PUBLIC
CHASTISEMENT OF MOSCOW IN MAY FOR WHAT WAS ALMOST CERTAINLY AN INADVERTENT BORDER INCIDENT. FINALLY, ALTHOUGH
THE BORDER TALKS WERE RESUMED FOR TWO MONTHS (MAY-JUNE),
THEY WERE AGAIN SUSPENDED WHEN NO PROGRESS WAS MADE.
47. CHAIRMAN HUA'S TRIP TO ROMANIA AND YUGOSLAVIA DREW
ATTENTION TO CHINA'S CURRENT POLICY TOWARD EASTERN EUROPE
AND THE DEGREE TO WHICH IT HAS BEEN SUCESSFUL. PEKING'S
CHIEF INTEREST IN TIES WITH ROMANIA AND YUGOSLAVIA IS TO
SUPPORT INDEPENDENCE FROM MOSCOW AND ENCOURAGE OTHER
EASTERN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES TO CONSIDER SIMILAR STANCES.
IN ADDITION, HOWEVER, ECONOMIC AND TECHNICAL EXCHANGES
WILL HELP CHINA MODERNIZE AND PEKING APPEARS VERY INTERESTED IN YUGOSLAVIA'S ECONOMIC SYSTEM AS A POSSIBLE MODEL
FROM WHICH CHINA COULD BORROW.
48. ON THE OTHER HAND, OTHER EASTERN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES
HAVE ECHOED MOSCOW'S DIRECT ATTACKS ON CHINA FOR &quot;STIRRING
CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL
PAGE 19

STATE 256102

UP TROUBLE&quot; THROUGH HUA'S VISIT. THIS SUGGESTS THAT THE
VERY SUCCESS OF HUA'S TRIP TO BELGRADE AND BUCHAREST
MAY IN FACT DISCOURAGE OTHER CAPITALS FROM FOLLOWING SUIT.
ALBANIA, TOO, WEIGHED IN WITH BITTER CRITICISM OF HUA'S
TRIP, ALTHOUGH THERE IS NO SIGN THAT IT WILL ALTER ITS
EQUALLY HARSH VIEW OF THE USSR. CHINA'S GROWING FRIENDSHIP WITH TIRANA'S ARCH-ENEMY, TITO, WAS ONE FACTOR WHICH
LED TO PEKING'S ANNOUNCEMENT ON JULY 7 THAT IT WAS TERMINATING ALL AID TO ALBANIA. HOWEVER, THE KEY ISSUES FOR
PEKING APPARENTLY WERE ALBANIA'S PUBLIC CRITICISM OF
PEKING'S WILLINGNESS TO ENLIST THE WEST, AND PARTICULARLY
THE US, IN ITS &quot;UNITED FRONT&quot; AGAINST THE SOVIETS AND THE
PERCEPTION THAT TIRANA WAS UNGRATEFUL FOR CHINA'S CONSIDERABLE AID OVER THE PAST TWO DECADES.
49. JAPAN. CHINA'S RELATIONS WITH JAPAN ARE FLOURISHING.
THE PROCESS OF NORMALIZATION, BEGUN IN 1972, WAS COMPLETED
IN AUGUST WITH THE SIGNING OF THE LONG-STALLED PEACE AND
FRIENDSHIP TREATY. IN THE NEGOTIATIONS PEKING CONCEDED
SUFFICIENT POINTS TO ACHIEVE A MAJOR GOAL, THE INCLUSION
OF AN &quot;ANTI-HEGEMONY&quot; CLAUSE CLEARLY, IF NOT EXPLICITLY,
AIMED AT THE SOVIETS. THE PFT FOLLOWED ON THE HEELS OF

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
THE 20 BILLION DOLLARS TRADE AGREEMENT SIGNED LAST FEBRUTHE 20 BILLION DOLLARS TRADE AGREEMENT SIGNED LAST FEBRUARY AND RECENTLY EXTENDED FOR ANOTHER FIVE YEARS. IN
ADDITION TO THESE POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC LINKS, WHICH
ARE THE CLOSEST PEKING HAS WITH ANY COUNTRY, VISITS BY
ACTIVE DUTY MILITARY PERSONNEL HAVE BEGUN. THESE MAY
BE DESIGNED PRIMARILY AS A WARNING TO MOSCOW, SINCE PEKING
WILL PROBABLY LOOK TO THE MORE DEVELOPED MUNITIONS INDUSTRIES OF EUROPE FOR WEAPONS AND TECHNOLOGY.
50. TWO ISSUES DO REMAIN, HOWEVER, BETWEEN PEKING AND
TOKYO: SOVEREIGNTY OVER THE SENKAKU ISLANDS AND THE
JAPAN-KOREA JOINT DEVELOPMENT ZONE IN THE EAST CHINA SEA.

STATE 256102

THE JAPANESE HAVE OFFICIALLY ACCEPTED THE REPEATED
CHINESE EXPLANATION THAT LAST APRIL'S CURIOUS INCIDENT
IN THE SENKAKUS WAS &quot;ACCIDENTAL,&quot; BUT THE PUZZLE REMAINS.
PEKING HAS NEVER RECOGNIZED THE RIGHT OF JAPAN AND KOREA
TO ESTABLISH A JOINT DEVELOPMENT ZONE WITHOUT CONSULTING
THE PRC. DESPITE THE POTENTIAL FOR TROUBLE THESE TWO
ISSUES POSE, HOWEVER, IT IS UNLIKELY THAT EITHER SIDE IS
INTERESTED IN DRAGGING THEM OUT IN THE NEAR FUTURE.
51. UNITED STATES. AN IMPORTANT INDICATION OF THE PRAGMATISM OF CHINESE FOREIGN POLICY HAS BEEN PEKING'S WILLING
NESS, EVEN EAGERNESS, TO BROADEN CONTACTS WITH THE US
PRIOR TO NORMALIZATION, AND DESPITE CONTINUED, IF MUTED,
ASSIGNMENT OF A VILLAIN'S ROLE TO THE US IN CHINA'S &quot;THREE
WORLD'S THEORY.&quot; CHAIRMAN HUA'S CONSPICUOUS MENTION OF
SINO-US &quot;POINTS IN COMMON&quot; IN HIS FEBRUARY REPORT TO THE
NPC WAS FOLLOWED BY THE WARM WELCOME GIVEN NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISOR BRZEZINSKI IN MAY. THIS, IN TURN, LED TO THE
SCIENCE DELEGATION'S VISIT TO PEKING IN AUGUST LED BY
FRANK PRESS FROM WHICH ARE GROWN CONCRETE DISCUSSIONS
OF A NUMBER OF PROJECTS. STUDENT EXCHANGES IS A PROMINENT
EXAMPLE. IN ADDITION, SINO-US TRADE IS INCREASING, AMERICAN FIRMS WILL PROBABLY PARTICIPATE IN THE DEVELOPMENT
OF CHINA'S OIL AND COAL RESOURCES, AND PEKING APPARENTLY
HAS REMOVED THE US FROM THE CATEGORY OF A &quot;RESIDUAL
SUPPLIER&quot; OF GRAIN.
52. CONCURRENTLY, PEKING SEEMS TO BE PURSUING A UNITED
FRONT APPROACH TO TAIWAN. RECENT STATEMENTS HAVE EMPHASIZED THAT THE PRC HOPES THAT REUNIFICATION WILL BE
PEACEFUL. ACTIONS, SUCH AS ATTENDANCE BY PRC DELEGATES
AT A TOKYO SCIENTIFIC CONFERENCE AT WHICH ROC SCIENTISTS
WERE PRESENT, MAY SUGGEST A DESIRE TO COOPERATE WITH TAICONFIDENTIAL

WAN. HOWEVER,DESPITE THESE MOVES, PEKING HAS MADE IT
CLEAR THAT IT WILL NEVER FORESWEAR THE USE OF FORCE TO
LIBERATE TAIWAN, SINCE THIS WOULD CONSTITUTE A LIMITATION
ON ITS SOVEREIGNTY.
53. WESTERN EUROPE. EUROPE OCCUPIES A KEY POSITION IN
CHINA'S VIEW OF WORLD POLITICS AS THE FOCAL POINT OF
&quot;SUPERPOWER CONTENTION,&quot; AND THUS THE MOST LIKELY IGNITION POINT FOR THE WORLD WAR PEKING BELIEVES IS POSTPONABLE, BUT INEVITABLE. TO DELAY THE OUTBREAK OF WAR,
THE PRC HAS BEEN URGING THE STRENGTHENING OF NATO, INCLUDING CLOSE COOPERATION WITH THE US. THE RECENT CONCLUSION OF A TRADE AGREEMENT WITH THE EEC IS ALSO INTENDED
TO SUPPORT EUROPEAN UNITY. FINALLY, AS PART OF THE
&quot;BROADEST POSSIBLE UNITED FRONT&quot; AGAINST THE SOVIETS,
PEKING NOW GENERALLY ENCOURAGES EUROPEAN NATIONS' INVOLVEMENT WITH THEIR FORMER AFRICAN COLONIES AS A COUNTER TO
SOVIET INFLUENCE.
54. SOUTHEAST ASIA. CHINA'S BASIC FOREIGN POLICY OBJECTIVE IN SOUTHEAST ASIA CONTINUES TO BE THE CONTAINMENT OF
SOVIET INFLUENCE, PARTICULARLY WITH REGARD TO THE SOVIET
UNION'S POSSIBLE USE OF HANOI AS A &quot;CAT PAW&quot; TOWARD MOSCOW'S GOAL OF &quot;WORLDWIDE HEGEMONISM.&quot; RELATIONS BETWEEN
PEKING AND HANOI HAVE CONTINUED TO DETERIORATE: CHINA
HAS ACCUSED VIETNAM OF SEEKING &quot;REGIONAL HEGEMONISM&quot;; THE
ISSUE OF ETHNIC CHINESE WHO FLED ACROSS THE SINO-VIETNAMESE BORDER HAS NOT BEEN RESOLVED DESPITE CONTINUING
NEGOTIATIONS; AND PEKING CONTINUES TO PROVIDE MATERIAL
AND VERBAL SUPPORT TO KAMPUCHEA. ALTHOUGH IT REMAINS
UNLIKELY CHINA WOULD INTERVENE MILITARILY IN THE KAMPUCHEAN- VIETNAMESE CONFLICT, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT FURTHER
INCIDENTS MAY OCCUR ALONG THE SINO-VIETNAMESE BORDER.
(THERE IS AT PRESENT NO EVIDENCE, HOWEVER, OF A MAJOR
MILITARY BUILD UP ON THE SINO-VIETNAMESE BORDER.)

SINGAPORE IN NOVEMBER. HOWEVER, PEKING'S TREATMENT OF

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
THE ETHNIC CHINESE ISSUE AND ITS CONTROVERSY WITH VIETNAM HAVE RAISED TRADITIONAL FEARS OF CHINESE INTERFERENCE
IN OTHER SOUTHEAST ASIAN STATES WITH LARGE ETHNIC CHINESE
MINORITY GROUPS. CHINA CONTINUES TO SEE ASEAN AS A BULWARK AGAINST SOVIET INFLUENCE,BUT IS CONCERNED OVER
VIETNAM'S SUDDEN INTEREST IN ASEAN AND PHAM VAN DONG'S
ROUND OF VISITS TO ASEAN CAPITALS.
56. KOREA. SOVIET-NORTH KOREAN RELATIONS HAVE GRADUALLY
COOLED OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS DUE TO MOSCOW'S MISTRUST
FOR KIM IL-SUNG'S LEADERSHIP, ALLOWING A NATURAL OPENING
FOR PEKING. IN SEPTEMBER VICE-PREMIER KENG PIAO DESCRIBED
1978 AS A YEAR IN WHICH SINO-KOREAN FRIENDSHIP REACHED A
NEW PEAK. VISITING NORTH KOREA IN MID-SEPTEMBER IN CONNECTION WITH THE 30TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE DPRK, VICE
CHAIRMAN TENG HSIAO-P'ING RENEWED CHINA'S PLEDGE TO
&quot;STEADFASTLY SUPPORT THE KOREAN PEOPLE IN THEIR JUST
STRUGGLE FOR THE INDEPENDENT AND PEACEFUL REUNIFICATION
OF THEIR COUNTRY.&quot; PEKING CONTINUES TO STRESS, HOWEVER,
THAT ITS COMMITMENT IS TO PEACEFUL REUNIFICATION. WARY
OF SOVIET DESIGNS, PEKING ACCUSED MOSCOW OF &quot;FLIRTING&quot;
WITH SEOUL WHEN A SOUTH KOREAN DELEGATION VISITED MOSCOW
IN SEPTEMBER,AND OF BETRAYING THE STRUGGLE FOR REUNIFICATION WHEN ON SEPTEMBER 7 A SOVIET PAPER REFERRED TO SOUTH
KOREA FOR THE FIRST TIME AS &quot;THE REPUBLIC OF KOREA.&quot;

57. THE MIDDLE EAST. CHINA HAS PUBLICLY EXPRESSED SUPPORT FOR THE SADAT PEACE INITIATIVE DESPITE THE RISK SUCH
SUPPORT POSES FOR PEKING'S TIES TO THE PLO AND THE ARAB
STEADFAST FRONT STATES. WHILE PEKING HAS TAKEN NO PUBLIC
POSITION ON THE CAMP DAVID SUMMIT, CHINESE PUBLICITY
OF THE AGREEMENTS REACHED INDICATES AT LEAST TENTATIVE
APPROVAL. PEKING'S &quot;WAIT AND SEE STANCE&quot; IS PROBABLY
CLOSELY TIED TO A DESIRE NOT TO ALIENATE THE ARAB STATES
WHICH OPPOSE EGYPT'S PEACE INITIATIVE. VERBAL SUPPORT
FOR THE PALESTINIAN CAUSE CONTINUES, BUT CHINA HAS IMPLICITLY AGREED TO ISRAEL'S RIGHT TO EXIST THROUGH
REFRAINING FROM THE BELLICOSE STANCE OF EARLIER YEARS.
THE PRC HAS NOT EXCLUSIVELY BACKED ANY OF THE PARTIES TO
THE CONTINUING LEBANESE CONFLICT, CALLING INSTEAD FOR
ARAB UNITY AGAINST WHAT IT DESCRIBES AS ZIONIST EXPANSIONISM AND SOVIET HEGEMONISM. PEKING SEES INSTABILITY IN
THE AREA AS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE SOVIET UNION TO INCREASE ITS INFLUENCE THROUGH THE PROVISION OF ARMS.
58. THE CHINESE EFFORT TO CONSOLIDATE ITS POSITION IN
THE MIDDLE EAST IS CONTINUING. IT ESTABLISHED DIPLOMATIC

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
RELATIONS WITH OMAN IN APRIL AND WITH LIBYA IN JULY.
WHERE RELATIONS WITH MOSCOW HAVE BEEN WEAK, AS WITH
EGYPT, OR HAVE DETERIORATED SOMEWHAT, AS IN IRAQ, CHINA
HAS SOUGHT TO STRENGTHEN TIES. ALTHOUGH CHINA HAS LITTLE
MATERIAL INCENTIVE TO OFFER THE ARABS IT CONTINUES LOW
LEVELS OF ECONOMIC AND MILITARY AID TO SEVERAL STATES.
THE PRC ALSO HAS TRADE TIES WITH MOST STATES IN THE REGION.
59. CHAIRMAN HUA'S VISIT TO IRAN IN AUGUST FURTHER EMPHASIZED THE IMPORTANCE OF THE MIDDLE EAST TO CHINA, PARTICULARLY IN REGARD TO THE IRANIAN-PROPOSED GULF SECURITY
PACT WHICH IS INTENDED TO EXCLUDE SOVIET INFLUENCE
FROM THE PERSIAN GULF LITTORAL. CHINA'S CONCERN OVER

PAGE 24

STATE 256102

GROWING SOVIET INFLUENCE IN THE PEOPLE'S DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF YEMEN APPARENTLY TRIGGERED ESTABLISHMENT OF
TIES WITH OMAN AND EFFORTS TOWARD THE SAME END WITH SAUDI
ARABIA AND THE UNITED ARAB EMIRATES. CHINESE INFLUENCE
IN THE PDRY HAS LESSENED APPRECIABLY DURING THE PAST YEAR
DUE TO INCREASING SOVIET INFLUENCE AND CHINESE OPPOSITION
TO THE USE OF ADEN IN THE SOVIET AIRLIFT TO ETHIOPIA.
60. DOMESTIC UNREST IN IRAN AND THE POSSIBILITY OF POLITICAL TURMOIL IN EGYPT, SHOULD SADAT'S PEACE INITIATIVE
FAIL, ARE OF CENTRAL CONCERN TO CHINA IN ITS DEALINGS
WITH THE MIDDLE EAST. ALTHOUGH THE PRC'S ABILITY TO
INFLUENCE EVENTS IN THE MIDDLE EAST IS LIMITED, RELATIONS
WITH IT HAVE A SYMBOLIC, ANTI-SOVIET SIGNIFICANCE AND CAN
BE USED BY THE MIDDLE EAST STATES TO DEMONSTRATE POLITICAL
INDEPENDENCE FROM THE OTHER MAJOR POWERS.
61. SOUTH ASIA. REPORTS FROM BOTH PEKING AND NEW DELHI
CURRENTLY DEMONSTRATE A STRONG DESIRE TO IMPROVE SINOINDIAN RELATIONS. INDIAN FOREIGN MINISTER VAJPAYEE'S
FORTHCOMING VISIT TO PEKING MAY RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT
PROGRESS IN THE SINO-INDIAN TERRITORIAL DISPUTE. CHINA
REPORTEDLY HAS ALREADY INDICATED A WILLINGNESS TO ALLOW
INDIAN PILGRIMS TO VISIT HINDU HOLY PLACES IN TIBET FROM
WHICH THEY HAVE BEEN EXCLUDED FOR SOME 20 YEARS. SEVERAL
RECENT EXCHANGES OF DELEGATIONS, INCLUDING TRADE AND
JOURNALIST GROUPS, HAVE FURTHER THAWED SINO-INDIAN RELATIONS WHICH, DESPITE AN EXCHANGE OF AMBASSADORS IN 1976,
HAD REMAINED COOL.

A MARKED INCREASE IN SOVIET INFLUENCE IN THE LATTER, HAS

CONTRIBUTED TO A SENSE OF URGENCY IN PEKING'S DRIVE
TO IMPROVE ITS RELATIONS WITH THE SUBCONTINENT. PREVIOUSLY LUKEWARM TOWARD THE CENTRAL TREATY ORGANIZATION, PEKING
HAS NOW MADE IT KNOWN THAT CENTO SHOULD BE STRENGTHENED
AS AN ANTI-SOVIET BULWARK.
63. IN A HIGH LEVEL GESTURE OF GOODWILL, VICE PREMIER
KENG PIAO VISITED PAKISTAN IN LATE JUNE TO OPEN OFFICIALLY
THE KARAKORAM HIGHWAY, BEGUN IN 1966 AND LARGELY BUILT
BY CHINESE LABORERS. PAKISTANI FOREIGN ADVISER AGHA
SHAHI VISITED PEKING IN SEPTEMBER AND RECEIVED CHINESE
ASSURANCES OF CONTINUED CHINESE SUPPORT. A FLURRY OF
CONTACTS INCLUDING A VISIT BY KING BIRENDRA IN MAY HAS
APPARENTLY GIVEN NEW DEPTH TO LONGSTANDING SINO-NEPALESE
TIES. RELATIONS WITH BANGLADESH LIKEWISE REMAIN WARM.
64. AFRICA. CHINA'S MAIN GOALS IN AFRICA ARE TO OPPOSE
THE EXPANSION OF SOVIET INFLUENCE AND STRENGTHEN INDEPENDENCE THROUGH ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. CHINA CONTINUES TO
SEE AFRICA AS A CRUCIAL AREA IN WHICH SOVIET EXPANSION
MUST BE CONTAINED, BELIEVING MOSCOW PLANS TO OUTFLANK
EUROPE BY MONOPOLIZING AFRICAN RESOURCES AND MARKETS
AND BY THREATENING THE VITAL SEA LANES AROUND AFRICA AND
THROUGH THE SUEZ CANAL. CUBA'S ROLE IN AFRICA AS A SOVIET
&quot;TROJAN HORSE&quot; IS FREQUENTLY CITED BY PEKING AND CHINA
HAS ENCOURAGED THE AFRICAN STATES TO OUST CUBA FROM
THE NON-ALIGNED MOVEMENT. CHINESE AID PROGRAMS CONTINUE
IN COUNTRIES SUCH AS GABON, GHANA,ZAIRE AND CAMEROON AND
CHINA'S REPUTATION FOR NO-STRINGS ATTACHED AID HELPS
OFFSET THE IRRITATION OF ITS ANTI-SOVIET PROPAGANDA.
65. BEING UNABLE TO COMPETE WITH MOSCOW IN EITHER
ECONOMIC OR MILITARY ASSISTANCE, PEKING HAS RECENTLY INCREASED BOTH ITS DIPLOMATIC ACTIVITY AND EXCHANGES OF DELEGATIONS. SENIOR CHINESE OFFICIALS TO VISIT AFRICA IN
RECENT MONTHS INCLUDED FOREIGN MINISTER HUANG HUA, WHO

66. THE TWO SITUATIONS THAT PRESENTLY CONCERN THE CHINESE

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
MOST ARE CONTINUING UNREST IN THE HORN AND THE SITUATION
IN SOUTHERN AFRICA. PEKING SEES ITS INTERESTS AS BEST
SERVED BY POLITICAL STABILITY AND NEGOTIATED SETTLEMENTS,
AS PROLONGED MILITARY CONFLICT IS CERTAIN TO DRIVE AFRICAN
GROUPS TOWARD THE SOVIET UNION FOR ARMS THAT CHINA CANNOT
SUPPLY. NONETHELESS, CHINA CONTINUES TO SUPPORT ARMED
STRUGGLE IN SOUTHERN AFRICA. THIS APPARENT CONTRADICTION
PROBABLY STEMS FROM THE NEED TO MAINTAIN A REVOLUTIONARY
IMAGE IN THE THIRD WORLD AS WELL AS THE KNOWLEDGE THAT
ATTEMPTS TO DISSAUDE AFRICANS FROM ARMED STRUGGLE WOULD
LEND CREDENCE TO SOVIET CHARGES OF CHINESE COLLABORATION
WITH &quot;REACTIONARIES.&quot; THUS, WHILE CHINA CONTINUES TO
PROVIDE LIMITED MILITARY AID TO SEVERAL GOVERNMENTS AND
GROUPS, THE PRC HAS MAINLY SOUGHT TO DISTINGUISH ITSELF
BY OSTENSIBLY STAYING OUT OF CONTENTION AND SUPPORTING
THE POPULAR AFRICAN THEMES OF UNITY AND SELF RELIANCE.
67. LATIN AMERICA. BOLIVIA, COLOMBIA, URAGUAY AND THE
MAJORITY OF THE CENTRAL AMERICAN COUNTRIES MAINTAIN DIPLOMATIC TIES WITH TAIPEI. HOWEVER, PEKING HAS EXTENDED
ITS WORLDWIDE DIPLOMATIC PUSH INTO LATIN AMERICA AND THERE
ARE REPORTS COLOMBIA MAY SOON RECOGNIZE THE PRC. A SMALL
PRC MISSION WAS OPENED IN BARBADOS IN APRIL (RELATIONS HAD
BEEN ESTABLISHED A YEAR EARLIER) AND A THREE-YEAR TRADE
AGREEMENT WAS SIGNED WITH ARGENTINA IN JUNE. ALSO IN

CHINESE OFFICIAL EVER TO VISIT LATIN AMERICA, THE VISIT
WAS MORE CEREMONIAL THAN SUBSTANTIVE.
68. THE MEXICAN PRESIDENT AND THE CHILEAN MINISTER OF
FOREIGN RELATIONS ARE EXPECTED TO VISIT PEKING SOON.
MUCH OF CHINA'S CURRENT ATTENTION TO LATIN AMERICA, THOUGH
STILL LOW KEY, IS IN RESPONSE TO CHINA'S PERCEPTION OF
CUBA AS &quot;A SURROGATE&quot; OF SOVIET INFLUENCE IN THE AREA.

68. THE PAST YEAR HAS BEEN AT BEST A MIDDLING ONE FOR
PYONGYANG. THE DPRK ECONOMY CONTINUES TO STAGNATE AND,
ALREADY LESS THAN HALF THE SIZE OF SOUTH KOREA'S, IT
FALLS EVEN FARTHER BACK AT AN ALMOST VISIBLE DAILY RATE.
WHILE THE NORTH KOREAN HARD-CURRENCY DEBT HAS KEPT STEADY
AT ABOUT 1.5 BILLION DOLLARS, PYONGYANG HAS BARELY KEPT
UP WITH THE RESCHEDULED PAYMENTS OF INTEREST ON THE DEBT,
AND HAS NOT REDUCED THE PRINCIPAL AT ALL. CONTINUED CREDIT TO THE DPRK HAS BECOME SOMETHING OF A POLITICAL QUESTION IN JAPAN, WHICH TO DATE HAS BEEN THE DPRK'S MAJOR
SOURCE OF MODERN TECHNOLOGY NEEDED FOR ADVANCING THE ECONOMY.

69. LONG A DIPLOMATIC FENCE-STRADDLER BETWEEN THE
PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA AND THE SOVIET UNION,OF LATE
NORTH KOREA SEEMS TO HAVE TILTED TOWARD THE CHINESE. CHINA'S CHAIRMAN AND PREMIER,HUA KUO-FENG,VISITED PYONGYANG
IN MAY, TO BE FOLLOWEDIN AUGUST BY A HIGH RANKING CHINESE
MILITARY DELEGATION AND IN SEPTEMBER, FOR THE DPRK'S
30TH ANNIVERSARY FETE, BY VICE-PREMIER TENG. ON THE OTHER
HAND, KIM'S TRIP TO MOSCOW, RUMORED TO BE PLANNED FOR
THIS YEAR, HAS NOT BEEN ANNOUNCED AND MAY WELL HAVE BEEN
CANCELLED. IN THE RECOGNITION CONTEST BETWEEN THE NORTH
AND THE SOUTH, THE DPRK ADVANCED ONE NOTCH WHEN NEWLYSOCIALIST AFGHANISTAN WITHDREW RECOGNITION FROM THE ROK,
BUT LOST HALF A NOTCH ON A FAR MORE IMPORTANT GAME-BOARD
WHEN SWEDEN DECIDED TO UPGRADE ITS MISSION IN SEOUL TO
A RESIDENT EMBASSY.
70. NORTH KOREA CONTINUES ITS POLICY OF SKEWING ITS
ECONOMY TOWARD THE MILITARY. ABOUT 15 PER CENT OF THE
GNP APPEARS TO GO TOWARD THE MILITARY, WITH AN EVEN GREATER PERCENTAGE OF THE HIGHEST-QUALITY RESOURCES DEVOTED
TO THE MILITARY SECTOR. THE NORTH APPEARS TO BE PUSHING
TO EXPAND ITS OWN MILITARY PRODUCTION CAPABILITIES INTO
NEW AREAS, REDUCING THEIR NEEDS FROM THE PRC AND THE USSR.
71. KIM IL-SONG CONTINUES TO RULE THE DPRK IN A ONE-MAN
FASHION ALMOST UNPARALLELED IN THE REST OF TODAY'S WORLD.
KIM'S HEALTH APPEARS GOOD. THERE IS STILL NOT, HOWEVER,
ANY ESTABLISHED MECHANISM FOR SUCCESSION, AND KIM HAS
APPARENTLY NOT ABANDONED HOPES THAT HIS SON, KIM CHONG-IL,
WILL BE THE NEXT HEAD OF THE DPRK. BECAUSE OF THE UNPOPULARITY OF THE IDEA OF AN OFFSPRING SUCCESSION AMONG THE
OTHER SOCIALIST STATES, AND POSSIBLY BECAUSE OF ADVERSE

SENTIMENT AMONG THE NORTH KOREAN MILITARY, KIM HAS KEPT
HIS DESIRES AND EFFORTS TO CONTROL THE SUCCESSION VERY
MUCH UNDER WRAPS.
B. THE SITUATION IN THE REPUBLIC OF KOREA
72. AN EXTRAORDINARILY HIGH RATE OF GROWTH AND THE HIGH
VISIBILITY OF ITS EXPORT-LED GROWTH STRATEGY ARE GIVING
THE ROK INCREASING PROMINENCE IN THE WORLD COMMUNITY. AT
HOME PRESIDENT PARK'S POSITION REMAINS STRONG DESPITE THE
ACTIVITIES OF DISSIDENT GROUPS, AND THERE IS NO EFFECTIVE
POLITICAL OPPOSITION. THE PUBLIC RESPONSE TO THE GOVERNMENT'S ECONOMIC ACHIEVEMENTS HAS BEEN ONE OF BROAD ACCEPTANCE AND SUPPORT.
73. IN THE FIRST HALF OF 1978 REAL GNP GROWTH WAS AT A
16 PER CENT RATE OVER THE 20 BILLION DOLLARS LEVEL OF 1977,
AND THE EXPORT TARGET OF 12.5 BILLION DOLLARS SEEMED
ATTAINABLE. SOUTH KOREA HAS CLEARLY OUTSTRIPPED THE NORTH
IN ECONOMIC GROWTH, AND THE GAP IS LIKELY TO WIDEN OVER
THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS. BARRING SUCH UNFORESEEN CIRCUMSTANCES AS A WORLDWIDE DEPRESSION, THE ROK'S AMBITIOUS
ECONOMIC GROWTH TARGETS FOR THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS
SEEM REASONABLE.
-- - -74. OVER THE PAST TWO YEARS KOREA'S TRADITIONALLY CLOSE
RELATIONSHIP WITH THE UNITED STATES HAS BEEN SHAKEN BY
THE &quot;KOREAGATE,&quot; HUMAN RIGHTS AND TROOP WITHDRAWAL ISSUES,
BUT THE PROCESS OF RENEWING THE RELATIONSHIP HAS BEGUN.
KOREAGATE APPEARS TO HAVE RUN ITS COURSE, AND THE IMPACT
OF WITHDRAWAL OF 3,400 TROOPS IN 1978 HAS BEEN CUSHIONED
BY CONGRESSIONAL APPROVAL OF AN 800 MILLION DOLLARS EQUIPMENT TRANSFER PACKAGE AND A CONTINUING FOREIGN MILITARY
SALES CREDIT PROGRAM OF 275 MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY.
75. WHILE UNHAPPY ABOUT THE TROOP WITHDRAWAL DECISION,
THE ROK NOW ACCEPTS THAT GIVEN THE ON-GOING US COMMITMENT,

THE RETENTION OF U.S. AIR POWER IN KOREA AND THE AVAILABILITY OF U.S. SEA POWER IN THE AREA, IT IS CAPABLE OF
DETERRING OR DEFEATING A NORTH KOREAN ATTACK. THE LARGE
AND WELL-EQUIPPED SOUTH KOREAN FORCES REMAIN UNDER THE
OPERATIONAL CONTROL OF THE COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF OF THE UN
COMMAND, BUT IN RECOGNITION OF THE LARGE ROLE BEING PLAYED
BY KOREA A NEW COMBINED FORCES COMMAND WILL BE INAUGURATED

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
THIS FALL THAT PROVIDES FOR MUCH GREATER ROK PARTICIPATION
IN THE CHAIN OF COMMAND.
76. THE YEAR 1978 HAS BEEN AN UNEVEN YEAR IN THE EVOLUTION OF THE KOREAN HUMAN RIGHTS REGIME, BUT PROGRESS IS
DISCERNIBLE. ALL BUT ONE OF THE MOST PROMINENT DISSIDENTS
IN CUSTODY HAVE BEEN RELEASED, PRESS CENSORSHIP HAS BEEN
RELAXED SOMEWHAT AND THE GOVERNMENT HAS SHOWN GREATER
RESTRAINT IN HANDLING STUDENT DEMONSTRATIONS. SOME PROVOCATIVE MANIFESTOES HAVE ALSO BEEN IGNORED. ON THE OTHER
HAND THE LEGAL MACHINERY WHICH HAS ENABLED THE REGIME TO
USE REPRESSIVE TACTICS REMAINS INTACT. IN LATE SEPTEMBER
THE INCREASED VIGOR WITH WHICH POLICE BROKE UP A SMALL
DEMONSTRATION OF DISSIDENT LABORERS WHO WERE SHOUTING
PERSONAL ATTACKS ON THE PRESIDENT SEEMED TO SIGNAL AN
ESCALATION OF TACTICS BY BOTH SIDES. DISSIDENT LEADERS
SEEM DETERMINED TO PROVOKE A REACTION FROM THE GOVERNMENT.
C. RELATIONS BETWEEN THE TWO KOREAS
77. THERE HAS BEEN LITTLE DISCERNIBLE MOVEMENT IN THE
ALMOST-FROZEN PICTURE OF NON-CONTACT BETWEEN THE TWO
KOREAS. THE VARIOUS MECHANISMS FOR DIRECT COMMUNICATION
BETWEEN THE ANTAGONISTS THAT WERE SET UP IN THE EARLY
1970,S, INCLUDING THE&quot;RED CROSS TALKS,&quot; ARE NOW MORICONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL
PAGE 31

STATE 256102

BUND. ROK PRESIDENT PARK PUT FORWARD A PROPOSAL IN JUNE
FOR ECONOMIC COOPERATION BETWEEN THE TWO KOREAS, BUT THE
PROPOSAL WAS QUICKLY REJECTED AND DENOUNCED BY THE NORTH.
KIM'S SEPTEMBER 9 SPEECH ON THE DPRK'S 30TH ANNIVERSARY
NOTED THAT THE DPRK GOVERNMENT WOULD BE WILLING TO HAVE
CONTACT WITH SOUTH KOREAN AUTHORITIES OR PARTIES, BUT WITH
PRECONDITIONS CLEARLY POLITICALLY UNACCEPTABLE TO THE ROK.
IV. SOUTHEAST ASIA
A. VIETNAM
78. THERE HAS BEEN SERIOUS DETERIORATION THIS YEAR IN
SINO-VIETNAMESE RELATIONS, CONCURRENT WITH AN IMPROVEMENT
IN VIETNAM'S RELATIONS WITH THE USSR. THIS SITUATION
CONTRASTS SHARPLY WITH THE RECENT PAST, ESPECIALLY
PRIOR TO 1975, WHEN VIETNAM SUSTAINED A SUCCESSFUL BALANCING ACT BETWEEN CHINA AND THE USSR, WHEREBY VIETNAM
OBTAINED NEEDED ASSISTANCE FROM BOTH COUNTRIES WHILE
AVOIDING EXCESSIVE DEPENDENCE ON EITHER.

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
79. THE IMMEDIATE CAUSE OF THE CHANGE HAS BEEN VIETNAM'S
CONFLICT WITH KAMPUCHEA. VIETNAM SEES PEKING'S SUPPORT
OF PHNOM PENH AS THE MAIN OBSTACLE TO ENDING THE COSTLY
BORDER WAR AND TO ITS LONGER TERM INTEREST IN ESTABLISHING
A RELATIONSHIP WITH KAMPUCHEA SIMILAR TO THE ONE IT HAS
WITH LAOS. PEKING, ON ITS PART, WANTS TO CURB VIETNAM'S
DRIVE FOR &quot;HEGEMONY&quot; IN INDOCHINA AND TO COUNTERACT WHAT
IT SEES AS HANOI'S MOVEMENT TOWARD CLOSER RELATIONS WITH
MOSCOW. SINO-VIETNAMESE TENSIONS WERE UNDOUBTEDLY HEIGHTENED AFTER HANOI INTENSIFIED ITS EFFORTS IN JUNE AGAINST
THE INTRANSIGENT PHNOM PENH REGIME WITH THE OCCUPATION
OF AREAS ON THE KAMPUCHEAN SIDE OF THE BORDER AND MORE
ACTIVE BACKING OF ANTI-PHNOM PENH INSURGENTS. HANOI
APPARENTLY DECIDED TO STAND FIRM AGAINST PEKING'S PRESCONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL
PAGE 32

STATE 256102

SURES, PROBABLY CALCULATING THAT PEKING WILL NOT INTERVENE MILITARILY.
80. THE ERUPTION OF SHARP DIFFERENCES BETWEEN HANOI AND
PEKING OVER THE ISSUE OF VIETNAM'S TREATMENT OF THE ETHNIC
CHINESE (AND THE ETHNIC CHINESE REFUGEES) HAS FURTHER
COMPLICATED THE RELATIONSHIP AND INTRODUCED NEW DANGERS
OF CONFLICT. THIS HIGHLY EMOTIONAL ISSUE APPEARS TO STEM
FROM CAUSES LARGELY INDEPENDENT OF THE VIETNAM-KAMPUCHEA
CONFLICT, I.E. HANOI'S MOVES BEGUN EARLY THIS YEAR TO ADVANCE SOCIALIZATION OF THE PRIVATE COMMERCIAL SECTOR, A
CAMPAIGN THAT IMPACTED LARGELY ON THE ETHNIC CHINESE.
IN ANY CASE,PEKING HAS HANDLED THE ISSUE IN A WAY THAT
AT LEAST IN PART IS DESIGNED TO PRESSURE AND WORRY HANOI
OVER ANY ACTIONS IT MAY TAKE THAT CHINA WOULD CONSIDER
HOSTILE. OVER THE MONTHS SUCH PRESSURES HAVE INCLUDED
POLEMICAL ATTACKS, THE CLOSING OF VIETNAM'S CONSULATES IN
CHINA,THE SENDING HOME OF VIETNAMESE STUDENTS, THE WITHDRAWAL OF AMBASSADORS, AND THE REDUCTION AND THEN FULL
TERMINATION OF CHINESE AID TO VIETNAM. WHILE THERE HAVE
BEEN INDICATIONS THAT BOTH SIDES WANT TO DEFUSE THE ETHNIC
CHINESE ISSUE, THE INCIDENTS THAT HAVE OCCURRED ALONG THE
BORDER AND THE RECENT BREAKDOWN OF THE VICE FOREIGN
MINISTER LEVEL TALKS MAKE FOR A TENSE SITUATION.
81. IN THE WAKE OF THE SERIOUS DETERIORATION OF ITS
RELATIONS WITH CHINA, VIETNAM HAS MOVED CLOSER TO THE USSR.
THIS WAS INDICATED BY HANOI'S DECISION IN JULY TO OFFICIALLY JOIN THE COUNCIL FOR MUTUAL ECONOMIC ASSISTANCE
(CEMA). THERE HAVE BEEN INDICATIONS OF AUGMENTATION OF
THE SOVIET PRESENCE IN VIETNAM, BUT NO EVIDENCE OF SOVIET
BASES OR MISSILES IN VIETNAM, AS PEKING HAS ALLEGED. IT

PAGE 33

STATE 256102

SEEMS LIKELY, HOWEVER, THAT VIETNAM, WHILE IT MAY ESTABLISH CLOSER RELATIONS WITH THE USSR, WILL DO ALL IT CAN
TO MAINTAIN ITS INDEPENDENCE. THIS IS LIKELY THE MAIN
MOTIVATION BEHIND HANOI'S INTENSIVE DIPLOMATIC CAMPAIGN
IN SOUTHEAST ASIA AND EUROPE, INCLUDING THE SOFTENING
OF ITS ATTITUDE TOWARD ASEAN AND THE CONCEPT OF A ZONE
OF PEACE. HANOI'S INITIATIVES TOWARD ITS NON-COMMUNIST
NEIGHBORS ARE ALSO INTENDED TO PRE-EMPT CHINA'S NEWLY
ASSERTIVE DIPLOMACY.
B. KAMPUCHEA
82. VIETNAM'S CURRENT MILITARY OPERATIONS IN KAMPUCHEA,
WHICH BEGAN IN JUNE, APPEAR AIMED AT ENDING PERSISENT
KHMER ATTACKS INSIDE VIETNAM, DESTROYING UNITS O KAMPUCHEA'S MAIN FORCES, AND INSERTING PRO-HANOI KHMERS
TRAINED IN VIETNAM FOR THE PURPOSE OF SUBVERTING THE POL
POT REGIME. THERE ARE INDICATIONS THAT VIETNAM IS REINFORCING ITS UNITS NEAR THE BORDER, AND PEKING HAS
ALLEGED THAT VIETNAM INTENDS TO LAUNCH A NEW OFFENSIVE
AS SOON AS THE CURRENT WET SEASON IS OVER. IT IS UNLIKELY
HOWEVER, THAT VIETNAM INTENDS TO ASSAULT PHNOM PENH
DIRECTLY OR TO SEIZE LARGE AREAS OF THE COUNTRY, DUE TO
UNCERTAINTY OVER THE CHINESE REACTION, THE HIGH COST
OF SUCH AN OPERATION IN THE FACE OF FIERCE RESISTANCE,
AND THE LIKELY UNFAVORABLE INTERNATIONAL REACTION.
83. THERE HAVE BEEN SIGNS THAT VIETNAMESE PRESSURES ARE
CAUSING DIFFICULTIES FOR THE PRESENT KAMPUCHEAN REGIME.
THESE SIGNS INCLUDE: AN INCREASED FLOW OF KAMPUCHEAN
REFUGEES INTO THAILAND, APPARENTLY MADE POSSIBLE BY THE
DIVERSION OF KAMPUCHEAN MILITARY FORCES AWAY FROM THE THAI
BORDER TO MEET NEEDS ON THE VIETNAM FRONT; THE INABILITY
OF THE KHMER FORCES, DESPITE SHARP COUNTERATTACKS, TO
RETAKE TOWNS OR TERRITORY IN EASTERN KAMPUCHEA CAPTURED
BY THE VIETNAMESE; AND SIGNS OF SPREADING INSURGENT
CONFIDENTIAL

STATE 256102

RESISTANCE.
84. ON THE OTHER HAND, THE REGIME HAS SHOWN ITSELF TO BE
TOUGH, STUBBORN, AND RELENTLESS, WITH A GREAT CAPACITY
FOR SURVIVAL -- FACTORS THAT MAKE IT HARD TO WRITE IT OFF.
DESPITE OBVIOUS PROBLEMS, THE ARMY REMAINS LOYAL AND

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
FIGHTS HARD TO THE APPARENT SURPRISE OF VIETNAM. HISTORICAL CONSIDERATIONS AND FIERCE NATIONAL AND ETHNIC ANIMOSITIES ARE IMPORTANT UNDERLYING REASONS. IRONICALLY,
PHNOM PENH'S INCREASED ACTIVITY TO WIN SUPPORT ABROAD IN
ITS HOUR OF NEED IS HANDICAPPED BY ITS PAST BELLIGERENT
ATTITUDE TOWARD OTHER COUNTRIES AND ITS BRUTAL DOMESTIC
POLICIES WHICH HAVE MADE IT A PARIAH TO SOME.
C. LAOS
85. VIETNAM'S &quot;SPECIAL RELATIONSHIP&quot; WITH LAOS CONTINUES,
GIVEN SUBSTANCE BY THE PRESENCE OF LARGE NUMBERS OF
VIETNAMESE ADVISORS IN THE LAO GOVERNMENT AND VIETNAMESE
TROOPS WHO ARE HELPING THE GOVERNMENT PUT DOWN INTERNAL
RESISTANCE. VIETNAMESE MILITARY ENGINEERS AND OTHER
SPECIALISTS ARE ASSISTING IN DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS AS WELL.
86. SEVERAL RECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN LAOS ARE UNCLEAR,
INCLUDING REPORTS OF WITHDRAWAL OF CHINESE ROAD BUILDING
UNITS IN NORTHERN LAOS. THE EXTENT OF THEIR WITHDRAWAL
AND THE REASONS (IT MIGHT SIMPLY REFLECT THE COMPLETION
OF PROJECTS) ARE UNCERTAIN. IT IS ALSO UNCERTAIN WHETHER
CHINESE UNITS NOT INVOLVED IN ROAD BUILDING HAVE BEEN
WITHDRAWN. WHATEVER THE DETAILS, THE RUGGED AREA OF
NORTHERN LAOS HAS LONG BEEN AN AREA OF CHINESE INTEREST
AND INFLUENCE, PARTICULARLY WITH THE TRIBAL GROUPS THERE.

IT SEEMS UNLIKELY THAT CHINA WOULD ABANDON ITS PREDOMINANT
POSITION OR THAT THE VIETNAMESE WOULD SEEK TO CONFRONT
THE CHINESE IN THAT AREA. THERE HAVE BEEN VIETNAMESE
CHARGES OF PRC SUPPORT TO INSURGENTS ELSEWHERE IN LAOS,
BUT WE HAVE SEEN NO EVIDENCE THAT THIS IS THE CASE.
D. THE ASEAN STATES
87. INDONESIA. IN MARCH 1978 PRESIDENT SUHARTO WAS REELECTED TO A THIRD FIVE-YEAR TERM AND FORMER FOREIGN
MINISTER ADAM MALIK ELECTED AS VICE PRESIDENT. THE
POLITICAL SITUATION, ALTHOUGH IT BECAME SOMEWHAT HEATED
IN PREPARATION FOR THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION, IS NOW
BASICALLY STABLE. INDONESIA IS APPROACHING ITS THIRD
FIVE YEAR PLAN WHICH RECOGNIZES THE NEED TO PLACE OVERWHELMING EMPHASIS ON THE DUAL NEEDS OF EMPLOYMENT AND
AGRICULTURE. THE HIGHLY INFLUENTIAL ARMY APPEARS UNITED
IN SUPPORT OF PRESIDENT SUHARTO'S CURRENT TERM OF OFFICE.
88. IN FOREIGN AFFAIRS INDONESIA IS A MODERATE LEADER

WEST. INDONESIA HAS BEEN THE MOST CAUTIOUS NEXT TO SINGAPORE IN THE RECENT ROUND OF OVERTURES BY COMMUNIST STATES
TO ASEAN.
89. MALAYSIA. PRIME MINISTER HUSSEIN BIN ONN, LEADER
OF THE GOVERNING POLITICAL COALITION, THE NATIONAL FRONT,
WON AN IMPRESSIVE VICTORY AND A DRAMATIC PERSONAL MANDATE
IN NATIONAL ELECTIONS IN JULY 1978. HE ALSO WON THE
PRESIDENCY OF HIS OWN PARTY, THE UMNO, IN SEPTEMBER.
THE NATIONAL FRONT PROVIDES MALAYSIA WITH A STABLE AND
EFFECTIVE GOVERNMENT MARKED BY EFFORTS TO SATISFY THE
OFTEN CONFLICTING INTERESTS OF THE TWO MAJOR COMMUNITIES
(THE MALAYS AND THE CHINESE). MALAY ATTEMPTS TO OBTAIN

A LARGER SHARE OF THE ECONOMIC REWARDS HAS ALIENATED
MANY CHINESE AND INDIANS, AND THIS WAS REFLECTED BY A
DISTURBING TREND TOWARD RACIAL POLARIZATION IN THE GENERAL
ELECTION. PM HUSSEIN HAS CONTINUED THE SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC
DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS INITIATED BY THE FORMER RAZAK GOVERNMENT, AS WELL AS GIVING HIGH PRIORITY TO COMBATTING THE
COMMUNIST INSURGENCY. ALTHOUGH STILL ALIVE, THE INSURGENCY IS NOT CURRENTLY A THREAT TO THE POLITICAL OR ECONOMIC
LIFE OF THE COUNTRY.

AND MODERATE POSTURE .
CORDIAL RELATIONS WITH WESTERN COUNTRIES, PARTICULARLY
BRITAIN, AUSTRALIA, AND NEW ZEALAND.
91. PHILIPPINES. MARCOS HELD ELECTIONS IN APRIL TO
ESTABLISH AN INTERIM NATIONAL ASSEMBLY AS PART OF A MUCH
PUBLICIZED CAMPAIGN TO RESTORE &quot;POLITICAL NORMALIZATION.&quot;
THE ELECTIONS WERE MARKED BY ALLEGATIONS OF FRAUD, PARTICULARLY IN THE MANILA AREA, AND THE ASSEMBLY IS ENTIRELY
PRO-GOVERNMENT, WITH NO REAL OPPOSITION REPRESENTATION.
IN JUNE MARCOS IMPLEMENTED THE SWITCH TO A MODIFIED PARLIAMENTARY SYSTEM, SO THAT HE IS NOW PRIME MINISTER AS WELL
AS PRESIDENT. MRS. MARCOS, NOW A CABINET MINISTER, PLAYS
AN INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT POLITICAL ROLE AND CLEARLY WOULD
LIKE TO BE HER HUSBAND'S HEIR APPARENT, ALTHOUGH IT IS
NOT YET CLEAR WHETHER SHE WILL BE DESIGNATED DEPUTY PRIME
MINISTER AND THUS INTERIM SUCCESSOR. SINCE THE ELECTIONS,
MARCOS -- IN WHAT HE CALLS &quot;A SINCERE ATTEMPT AT MAINTAINING NATIONAL UNITY&quot; -- HAS MET WITH OPPOSITION POLITICAL LEADERS, AUTHORIZED THE PUBLICATION OF AN OPPOSITION

PROVISIONS OF MARTIAL LAW REMAIN IN FORCE, HOWEVER, AFTER
MORE THAN SIX YEARS.
92. MARCOS CONTINUES TO PURSUE &quot;A BALANCED FOREIGN
POLICY&quot; BY BROADENING RELATIONS WITH COMMUNIST STATES,
PARTICIPATING ACTIVELY IN THIRD WORLD FORUMS, AND CONSCIOUSLY TRYING TO DIFFERENTIATE HIS FOREIGN POLICY FROM
THAT OF THE U.S. DESPITE RHETORICAL SUPPORT FOR G-77
POSITIONS, THE PHILIPPINES REMAINS RELATIVELY MODERATE
ON NORTH-SOUTH ISSUES AND AVOIDS EXTREME POSITIONS.
93. THE U.S. IS CURRENTLY DISCUSSING WITH THE PHILIPPINES
AMENDMENTS TO THE MILITARY BASES AGREEMENT -- WHICH RUNS
TO 1991 AND THEREAFTER BECOMES SUBJECT TO ABROGATION BY
EITHER PARTY ON ONE YEAR'S NOTICE--THAT WOULD PROVIDE
A CLEARER AFFIRMATION OF PHILIPPINE SOVEREIGNTY WHILE AT
THE SAME TIME ASSURING THE U.S. EFFECTIVE COMMAND AND CONTROL OVER THE ESSENTIAL MILITARY FACILITIES.
94. THAILAND. DESPITE THE LARGE NUMBER OF CHANGES OF
REGIME SINCE THE OVERTHROW OF THE ABSOLUTE MONARCHY IN
1932, THE POWERFUL CIVILIAN AND MILITARY BUREAUCRACIES
MAINTAIN CONSIDERABLE CONTINUITY IN IMPLEMENTING GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS. THAILAND REMAINS A FUNDAMENTALLY STABLE
SOCIETY WITH A HIGH DEGREE OF RELIGIOUS AND ETHNIC UNITY.
95. THE CURRENT THAI CABINET UNDER PM (GENERAL)KRIANGSAK
CHAMANAN ASSUMED POWER ON NOVEMBER 13, 1977. KRIANGSAK
GOVERNS THROUGH AN INTERIM CONSTITUTION PENDING PROMULGATION OF A NEW CONSTITUTION AND GENERAL ELECTIONS TO BE
HELD NO LATER THAN APRIL 1979. THE KRIANGSAK GOVERNMENT
STRESSES THE THEMES OF NATIONAL RECONCILIATION AND MODERATE REFORM IN DEALING WITH THAILAND'S SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC PROBLEMS. PM KRIANGSAK HAS GAINED WIDESPREAD PUBLIC
ACCEPTANCE AND SUPPORT FOR HIS PLANS AND HAS APPOINTED
A TEAM OF UNUSUALLY COMPETENT MINISTERS. THE CURRENT

96. THAILAND BEGAN AS EARLY AS 1975 TO EXPAND ITS
DIPLOMATIC ACTIVITY IN AN EFFORT TO NORMALIZE RELATIONS
WITH THE STATES OF INDOCHINA AND THE PRC. FOLLOWING A
ONE YEAR DERAILMENT OF THESE INITIATIVES BY THE THANIN
REGIME, THE KRIANGSAK GOVERNMENTHAS ACHIEVED A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN RELATIONS WITH ASIAN COMMUNIST
STATES. BANGKOK AND HANOI EXCHANGED AMBASSADORS IN
1978 AND THE RECENT VISIT TO BANGKOK OF PREMIER PHAM
VAN DONG FURTHER CONSOLIDATED THE RELATIONSHIP. RELATIONS
WITH LAOS HAVE IMPROVED AS WELL. RELATIONS BETWEEN
THAILAND AND CAMBODIA HAVE PROVED MORE DIFFICULT,
ALTHOUGH SINCE THE JULY 1978 VISIT TO BANGKOK OF IENG SARY,
THE CAMBODIANS HAVE IND CATED A WILLINGNESS TO ALLOW
A THAI EMBASSY TO OPEN IN PHNOM PENH AND A DESIRE TO
REOPEN THEIR EMBASSY IN BANGKOK. THAILAND'S RELATIONS
WITH THE PRC REMAIN GOOD. DESPITE THIS ADJUSTMENT OF
THAI FOREIGN POLICY TO REGIONAL REALITIES, THAILAND CONTINUES TO REGARD ITS RELATIONS WITH THE ASEAN PARTNERS
AND THE UNITED STATES AS OF THE MOST FUNDAMENTAL IMPORTANCE.

IT ACTIVELY PROMOTES PEACEFUL AND COOPERATIVE TIES BETWEEN ITS NEIGHBORS, PARTICULARLY THE OTHER ASEAN COUNTRIES

EVEN MORE CONCERNED THAN ITS ASEAN PARTNERS OVER LONG
TERM SOVIET AND VIETNAMESE INTENTIONS IN THE REGION AND
HAS OFTEN VOICED ITS SUPPORT FOR CONTINUED U.S. AND
WESTERN PRESENCE IN THE REGION.
99. SINGAPORE CONTINUES TO ALLOW US NAVAL VESSELS AND
AIRCRAFT TO UTILIZE PORT AND AIRFIELD FACILITIES. DURING
THE PAST YEAR THE GOS AGREED TO THE STAGING OF P-3 RECONNAISSANCE FLIGHTS OVER THE STRAITS AND INDIAN OCEAN. IT
ALSO WELCOMED THE VISIT OF THE NUCLEAR CARRIER ENTERPRISE.

A. INDIA
100. INTERNAL SITUATION. INITIAL EUPHORIA OVER THE VICTORY OF THE JANATA PARTY AND THE OUSTER OF INDIRA GANDHI
HAS GIVEN WAY TO INCREASED PUBLIC DISILLUSIONMENT WITH
THE INACTION AND CAUTIOUSNESS OF THE DESAI GOVERNMENT.
A RECENT CRISIS IN THE JANATA PARTY WHICH THREATENED ITS
UNITY HAS BEEN DEFUSED BUT NOT YET RESOLVED TO THE SATISFACTION OF ALL PARTIES. IT WAS PRECIPITATED WHEN PRIME
MINISTER DESAI SUMMARILY FIRED TWO CABINET MINISTERS
WHO PUBLICLY CRITICIZED DESAI FOR NOT MOVING MORE QUICKLY
TO PROSECUTE MRS. GANDHI. JANATA'S REAL ACHIEVEMENTS IN
RESTORING DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENT ARE FADING IN THE POPULAR

MIND AS INDIA'S LONG STANDING PROBLEMS GO UNANSWERED.
101. RECORD HARVESTS, A SATISFACTORY BALANCE OF PAYMENTS
POSITION, RISING EXPORTS AND A MODERATE INFLATION RATE
HAVE BOLSTERED ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE. WITH FOREIGN
EXCHANGE RESERVES EXCEEDING 6 MILLION DOLLARS AND A FOODGRAIN STOCKPILE OF 20 MILLION TONS INDIA CAN NOW WITHSTAND ONE AND PERHAPS TWO POOR HARVESTS. NEVERTHELESS,
THERE IS GROWING DISCONTENT OVER STAGNATION IN KEY AREAS
OF THE ECONOMY.
102. FOREIGN AFFAIRS. UNTIL THE COUP IN KABUL, CONSIDERABLE PROGRESS HAD BEEN MADE IN THE NORMALIZATION OF RELATIONS BETWEEN INDIA AND PAKISTAN. THE EVENTS IN AFGHANISTAN ACCENTUATED ISLAMABAD'S BASIC RESERVATIONS ABOUT GOI
POLICY WHEN INDIA HASTENED TO RECOGNIZE THE TARAKI GOVERNMENT, SECOND ONLY TO THE SOVIETS. NEW DELHI IS HOPEFUL
THAT IT WILL RETAIN ITS TRADITIONALLY GOOD RELATIONS WITH
AFGHANISTAN AND BELIEVES THAT AFGHAN NATIONALISM AND
ISLAM WILL IMPOSE DEFINITE LIMITS ON THE GROWTH OF SOVIET
INFLUENCE, THOUGH INDIA RECOGNIZES THAT THE EROSION OF
SUPPORT FOR THE TARAKI GOVERNMENT MAY FORCE KABUL CLOSER
TO MOSCOW.
103. FOREIGN MINISTER VAJPAYEE WILL VISIT CHINA IN NOVEMBER. THE POSSIBILITY OF A BORDER SOLUTION EXISTS. HOWEVER, AS IT WOULD INVOLVE SIGNIFICANT POLITICAL COSTS FOR
BOTH SIDES, PROSPECTS FOR AN EARLY SOLUTION OF THE BORDER
ISSUE REMAIN REMOTE.
104. INDO-SOVIET RELATIONS HAVE CHANGED IN ATMOSPHERE
IF NOT REAL TERMS UNDER DESAI. ALTHOUGH DESAI PROMISED
THERE WOULD BE NO SIGNIFICANT SHIFT IN BILATERAL RELATIONS

HE HAS REFUSED TO ENDORSE THE CONCEPT OF A &quot;SPECIAL
RELATIONSHIP&quot; BETWEEN INDIA AND THE USSR.
105. WHILE ANXIOUS TO MAINTAIN AN ARMS RELATIONSHIP
WITH THE SOVIETS, THE JANATA GOVERNMENT, IN PURSUIT OF
&quot;GENUINE NON-ALIGNMENT,&quot; HAS ALSO DECIDED TO DIVERSIFY
ITS SOURCES OF SUPPLY. THE GOI APPEARS TO BE ON THE VERGE
OF A DECISION TO PURCHASE DEEP PENETRATION STRIKE AIRCRAFT
FROM THE WEST.
B. AFGHANISTAN
106. INTERNAL SITUATION. THE TARAKI REGIME CONTINUES ITS
EFFORTS TO CONSOLIDATE ITS CONTROL BOTH IN KABUL AND THE
COUNTRYSIDE. THE PURGE OF PARCHAMISTS BEGUN IN JUNE
APPEARS TO BE CONTINUING WITH RECENT DEVELOPMENTS INCLUDING THE SACKING OF SIX PARCHAM AMBASSADORS AND THE RESHUFFLING OF PERSONNEL IN KABUL. AMONG THESE WERE
AMBASSADOR TO WASHINGTON NOOR AHMAD NOOR AND PARCHAM
LEADER BABRAK KARMAL. WE HAVE REPORTS OF TRIBAL OPPOSITION INLCUDING ARMED RESISTANCE PARTICULARLY IN THE EASTERN PROVINCES OF AFGHANISTAN. SO FAR, THE DEMOCRATIC
REPUBLIC OF AFGHANISTAN (DRA) APPEARS TO ENJOY THE CONTINUED LOYALTY OR AT LEAST ACQUIESCENCE OF THE MILITARY
BUT IT SEEMS THAT TARAKI HAS SERIOUSLY NARROWED THE BASE
OF HIS SUPPORT AND HENCE INCREASED THE IMPORTANCE OF A
SOVIET PROP TO HIS GOVERNMENT. AT THE SAME TIME, DEPUTY
PRIME MINISTER AND FOREIGN MINISTER AMIN HAS EMERGED AS A
REAL POWER BEHIND THE THRONE APPARENTLY DERIVING HIS
STRENGTH FROM HIS ORGANIZATIONAL ABILITIES AND HIS CLOSE
TIES WITH THE AFGHAN MILITARY.
107. FOREIGN POLICY. THE DRA CONTINUES TO VOICE SUPPORT
FOR COOPERATIVE RELATIONS WITH ITS NEIGHBORS AND SAYS IT
WILL FOLLOW AN INDEPENDENT AND NON-ALIGNED POLICY. THE

PUSHTUNISTAN AND BALUCHISTAN, BUT GENERAL ZIA RECENTLY
VISITED KABUL AND MET WITH TARAKI AND AMIN IN A CONSTRUCTIVE ATMOSPHERE ALTHOUGH REPORTELDY LITTLE OF SUBSTANCE
WAS DISCUSSED. INDIAN FOREIGN MINISTER VAJPAYEE WAS IN
KABUL SEPTEMBER AND HEARD AMIN PRAISE THE STATE OF INDOAFGHAN RELATIONS.

108. AFGHANISTAN'S RELATIONS WITH THE SOVIET UNION HAVE
GROWN SIGNIFICANTLY CLOSER SINCE THE APRIL COUP, AND THERE
HAS BEEN A CONTINUING LEFTWARD SHIFT IN AFGHAN FOREIGN
POLICY POSITIONS (SUCH AS THE BREAKING OF RELATIONS WITH
THE REPUBLIC OF KOREA AND SUPPORT FOR THE IRAQI/CUBAN RESOLUTION ON PUERTO RICO IN THE COMMITTEE OF 24). OVER
THIRTY AID AGREEMENTS HAVE BEEN SIGNED BETWEEN THE SOVIET
UNION AND AFGHANISTAN. ALTHOUGH MANY OF THESE WERE IN THE
PIPELINE BEFORE THE COUP, BOTH SIDES HAVE MOVED WITH GREAT
RAPIDITY TO FINALIZE AGREEMENTS. SOVIET ADVISERS IN AFGHANISTAN HAVE NOT ONLY INCREASED IN NUMBERS TO BETWEEN 2,500
AND 3,000 BUT THEIR INFLUENCE WITHIN THE DRA SEEMS ENHANCED. ALTHOUGH THE SOVIETS ARE PROBABLY NOT HAPPY WITH THE
SUDDENNESS WITH WHICH TARAKI HAS MOVED AGAINST HIS OPPONENTS, THEIR SUPPORT FOR TARAKI IS CONTINUING.
C. PAKISTAN
109. INTERNAL SITUATION. THE PRESENT MARTIAL LAW GOVERNMENT CAME TO POWER IN JULY 1977 WHEN GENERAL ZIA LED A
MILITARY COUP WHICH OVERTHREW FORMER PRIME MINISTER BHUTTO.
ON SEPTEMBER 16, 1978 GENERAL ZIA WAS SWORN IN AS PRESIDENT. NATIONAL ELECTIONS HAVE BEEN PROMISED FOR SOMETIME
PRIOR TO OCTOBER 1979.

110. BHUTTO, THOUGH IN JAIL, REMAINS A DOMINANT POLITICAL
FIGURE. HE HAS BEEN CHARGED AND CONVICTED IN THE LAHORE
COURT ON THE CHARGE OF CONSPIRACY TO MURDER A POLITICAL
OPPONENT IN 1973 AND IS APPEALING THE CONVICTION AND DEATH
SENTENCE TO THE SUPREME COURT OF PAKISTAN. IF THE SUPREME
COURT UPHOLDS BOTH THE VERDICT AND THE DEATH SENTENCE THEN
PRESIDENT ZIA WILL BE FORCED TO MAKE THE ULTIMATE DECISION
ON BHUTTO'S FATE. IN MAKING HIS DECISION, ZIA WILL HAVE
TO CONSIDER THE DOMESTIC POLITICAL IMPACT OF AN EXECUTION
AS WELL AS PROBABLE INTERNATIONAL REPERCUSSIONS.
111. FOREIGN AFFAIRS. PAKISTAN WAS SHAKEN BY THE AFGHAN
COUP AND BY THE RECENT UNREST IN IRAN. PAKISTAN NOW BELIEVES THAT AFGHANISTAN HAS BECOME A SATELLITE OF THE
SOVIET UNION,AND THAT THIS REPRESENTS A NEW AND MAJOR SECURITY THREAT. FACED WITH THIS SITUATION, PAKISTAN IS CONSIDERING WITHDRAWING FROM CENTO AND MAY BE SEEKING SOME
DEGREE OF ACCOMMODATION WITH THE NON-ALIGNED BLOC AND THE
SOVIET UNION. WE BELIEVE HOWEVER THAT PAKISTAN FOR THE
MOMENT HAS PROBABLY RESERVED ITS POSITION ON WITHDRAWING
FROM CENTO.

VI. SOVIET POLICY TOWARD ASIA
112. CHINA. CONTAINMENT OF CHINESE IDEOLOGICAL AND DIPLOMATIC INITIATIVES AND DEFENSE AGAINST CHINA'S POTENTIAL
MILITARY THREAT FORM THE BASIC TENETS OF SOVIET POLICY
TOWARD ASIA. IN RECENT MONTHS, MOSCOW HAS BEEN HIGHLY DISTURBED BY A NEW ASSERTIVENESS AND FLEXIBILITY IN PEKING'S
FOREIGN POLICY, AND THE PROSPECT OF IMPROVED CHINESE RELATIONS WITH THE US, AND WESTERN EUROPE. THIS CONCERN
WAS DRAMATICALLY HIGHLIGHTED BY AN AUGUST 26 POLITBURO
STATEMENT WHICH CHARGED THAT CHINA WAS TRYING TO GAIN
ACCESS TO NATO ARSENALS AND IMPLIED THAT ARMS SALES TO
CHINA WOULD DESTROY CHANCES FOR A NEW STRATEGIC ARMS LIMICONFIDENTIAL

TATION AGREEMENT.
113. DESPITE A VIRULENT PROPAGANDA CAMPAIGN,THE SOVIETS
HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO PREVENT CHAIRMAN HUA'S WARM RECEPTION
IN EASTERN EUROPE, NORTH KOREA'S PRESENT &quot;TILT&quot; TOWARD
PEKING, THE SIGNING OF THE PEACE AND FRIENDSHIP TREATY WITH
JAPAN, OR CHINA'S MILITARY SUPPORT FOR CAMBODIA AND IT;
CONTINUING PRESSURE ON VIETNAM. IN THE FACE OF PEKING'S
CURRENT DIPLOMATIC OFFENSIVE, THE SOVIETS HAVE APPEARED
NOT ONLY INEFFECTUAL, BUT ALSO OUTMANEUVERED BY THE CHINESE.
114. THE SOVIETS APPARENTLY SEE LITTLE PROSPECT FOR IMPROVING SINO-SOVIET RELATIONS. AS A RESULT, THEY WILL TRY TO
MAINTAIN THE PRESENT LEVEL IN STATE-TO-STATE RELATIONS
AND WORK TO COUNTER CHINESE ANTI-SOVIET ACTIVITIES. MILITARILY, THE SOVIETS WILL MAINTAIN SUPERIOR FORCES ON THE
CHINESE BORDER IN ORDER TO DEAL EXPEDITIOUSLY WITH ANY
CHALLENGE. AT AN APPROPRIATE TIME NEXT YEAR, MOSCOW WILL
PROBABLY AGAIN ASK FOR A RECONVENING OF THE BORDER NEGOTIATIONS, BUT WITH LITTLE REAL HOPE THAT THE CHINESE WILL BE
INTERESTED IN MAING PROGRESS.
115. DURING TALKS WITH THE JAPANESE, TENG HSIAO-P'ING
ANNOUNCED THAT CHINA WILL INFORM THE SOVIETS OF ITS INTENTION TO ABROGATE THE SINO-SOVIET TREATY OF ALLIANCE IN
APRIL NEXT YEAR. WHEN THIS OCCURS, MOSCOW WILL PORTRAY IT
AS ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF PEKING'S ANTI-SOVIET POLICY, BUT
WILL ATTEMPT TO PLAY DOWN ITS PRACTICAL SIGNIFICANCE.
116. JAPAN. SOVIET REACTION TO THE CONCLUSION OF THE
SINO-JAPANESE PEACE AND FRIENDSHIP TREATY (PFT), WHICH INCONFIDENTIAL

STATE 256102

CLUDES AN ANTI-HEGEMONY CLAUSE AIMED BY PEKING AT MOSCOW,
HAS BEEN CRITICAL BUT RESTRAINED. IN HIS FIRST MEETING WITH
A JAPANESE DELEGATION AFTER THE SIGNING, PREMIER KOSYGIN
STRONGLY CRITICIZED THE TREATY, BUT INDICATED THAT MOSCOW
WANTED TO MAINTAIN GOOD RELATIONS, ESPECIALLY IN THE ECONOMIC SPHERE. KOSYGIN'S REMARKS COUPLED WITH EARLIER SOVIET
STATEMENTS THAT JAPANESE INTENTIONS WOULD BE JUDGED BY
ACTIONS NOT WORDS INDICATE THE SOVIETS WILL LIMIT THEIR
REACTION TO THE TREATY. MOSCOW COULD RETALIATE,HOWEVER,
BY DELAYING SOME POLITICAL VISITS AND POSTPONING FINAL
AGREEMENT ON JOINT FISHING VENTURES.
117. THE SOVIETS HAVE TRADITIONALLY RELIED ON A COMBINATION
OF POLITICAL TOUGHNESS, MILITARY SUPERIORITY AND ECONOMIC
INCENTIVES IN DEALING WITH THE JAPANESE. THEY CAN NOW BE
EXPECTED TO RENEW THEIR INSISTENCE THAT JAPAN BALANCE THE
CHINESE PFT BY SIGNING A &quot;GOOD NEIGHBOR TREATY&quot; WITH MOSCOW. THEY WILL ALSO PUSH FOR AN INCREASE IN TRADE AND
ENCOURAGE EXPANDED JAPANESE PARTICIPATION IN SIBERIAN
DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS. ANY REAL IMPROVEMENT IN SOVIETJAPANESE POLITICAL RELATIONS, WILL BE PREVENTED,HOWEVER,
BY THE SOVIETS' CONTINUED REFUSAL TO DISCUSS THE RETURN
OF THE NORTHERN TERRITORIES, FOUR NORTHERN ISLANDS OCCUPIED
SINCE THE END OF WORLD WAR II.
118. KOREA. THE SOVIET UNION'S ONCE WARM RELATIONSHIP
WITH NORTH KOREA HAS COOLED SIGNIFICANTLY. KIM IL-SONG
HAS NOT VISITED MOSCOW SINCE 1961. THE SOVIETS HAVE NOT
DELIVERED MAJOR ITEMS OF MILITARY EQUIPMENT FOR SEVERAL
YEARS. FOLLOWING CHAIRMAN HUA'S HIGHLY SUCCESSFUL VISIT
TO PYONGYANG, NORT- KOREA HAS REBROADCAST CHINESE STATEMENTS CRITICIZING THE USSR AND NOW APPEARS ON THE VERGE
OF OPENLY SUPPORTING PEKING'S POSITION IN THE SINO-SOVIET
DISPUTE.
CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL
PAGE 46

STATE 256102

119. POSSIBLY IN RESPONSE TO THIS NORTH KOREAN &quot;TILT&quot;
TOWARD CHINA, MOSCOW HAS PERMITTED SOME LOW-LEVEL CONTACTS
WITH SOUTH KOREANS AND HAS TAKEN THE UNUSUAL STEP OF PERMITTING THE ROK HEALTH MINISTER TO ATTEND A UN CONFERENCE
IN THE SOVIET UNION. THIS HAS TOUCHED OFF PRESS SPECULATION
IN SEOUL ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF FURTHER CONTACTS BETWEEN
THE ROK AND THE SOVIETS.

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014

120. AS A PRACTICAL MATTER THE SOVIETS WOULD GAIN LITTLE
BY PUSHING THE NORTH KOREANS FURTHER INTO THE CHINESE
EMBRACE. THERE ARE INDICATIONS THAT KIM IL-SONG MAY BE
INVITED TO VISIT MOSCOW LATER THIS YEAR, A SOVIET INITIATIVE WHICH WOULD HELP RESTORE NORTH KOREA'S TRADITIONAL
BALANCE IN ITS RELATIONS WITH THE PRC AND THE USSR.
121. SOUTHEAST ASIA. SOVIET POLICY TOWARD SOUTHEAST ASIA
IS LARGELY DETERMINED BY ITS RELATIONSHIP WITH VIETNAM,
THE ONLY STATE WITH WHICH IT ENJOYS CLOSE RELATIONS IN REGION. AFTER FIRING A PROPAGANDA BARRAGE AT THE OUTSET OF
THE VIETNAM-CAMBODIAN CONFLICT, THE SOVIETS HAVE COME TO
TREAT THE INDOCHINA CONFLICT IN A RELATIVELY LOW-KEY MANNER. THERE MAY HAVE BEEN SOME INCREASE IN SOVIET PRESENCE
AND ASSISTANCE TO VIETNAM, BUT MOSCOW HAS BEEN CAREFUL NOT
TO PROVOKE PEKING INTO TAKING MILITARY ACTION AGAINST
HANOI.
122. WHILE PROVIDING PROPAGANDA SUPPORT AGAINST CHINA, THE
SOVIETS HAVE ENDORSED VIETNAMESE EFFORTS TO IMPROVE RELATIONS WITH THE ASEAN STATES, SUPPORTED A VIETNAMESE ZONE
OF PEACE INITIATIVE, AND ENCOURAGED HANOI TO SEEK BETTER
RELATIONS WITH THE US. THE SOVIETS APPEAR TO BE SENSITIVE
TO VIETNAMESE DESIRES TO PRESERVE THEIR INDEPENDENCE. THEY
PROBABLY DO NOT EXPECT THE VIETNAMESE TO PERMIT A SOVIET
CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL
PAGE 47

STATE 256102

NAVAL PRESENCE AND HAVE NOT PUSHED FOR A CLOSER RELATIONSHIP THAN HANOI IS WILLING TO ACCEPT. THE SOVIETS MAY SEE
IMPROVED VIETNAMESE-ASEAN RELATIONS AS PROVIDING OPPORTUNITIES FOR GREATER SOVIET CONTACT WITH ITS MEMBER STATES.
123. DESPITE MOSCOW'S MORE POSITIVE VIEW OF ASEAN, THE
NON-COMMUNIST COUNTRIES IN SOUTHEAST ASIA REMAIN HIGHLY
SUSPICIOUS OF SOVIET INTENTIONS, AND PERCEIVE A GENERALIZED COMMUNIST THREAT TO THEIR SECURITY. SOVIET OPTIONS
ARE SEVERELY LIMITED BY SUCH FEARS AND THE AREA'S TRADITIONAL PRO-WESTERN ORIENTATION.
124. SOVIET MILITARY PRESENCE. SOVIET MILITARY PRESENCE IN
ASIA IS COMPOSED OF LARGE, WELL-EQUIPPED LAND, AIR AND
MISSILE FORCES ON THE CHINESE FRONTIER AND THE SOVIET
PACIFIC FLEET BASED PRIMARILY AT VLADIVOSTOK AND PETROPAVLOVSK. SOVIET LAND FORCES ARE PRIMARILY COMMITTED TO
DEFENSE AGAINST CHINA. THE PACIFIC FLEET'S PRINCIPAL MISSION IS TO LAUNCH BALLISTIC-MISSILE STRIKES AGAINST THE
US, OPPOSE US NAVAL FORCES IN THE NORTHWEST PACIFIC AND,
INCREASINGLY, TO DEMONSTRATE SOVIET POWER IN THE REGION.

IT HAS A LARGE NUMBER OF VESSELS, BUT IS QUALITATIVELY
INFERIOR TO OTHER SOVIET FLEETS. IN THE PAST FIVE YEARS
ITS CAPABILITY HAS DRAMATICALLY INCREASED.
125. ALTHOUGH SOVIET PACIFIC FORCES NORMALLY OPERATE CLOSE
TO HOME WATERS, THEY HAVE CONDUCTED EXERCISES IN THE
PHILIPPINE SEA AND REGULARLY PROVIDE ELEMENTS FOR THE
INDIAN OCEAN SQUADRON. THE INCREASE IN THE SIZE OF THE
SOVIET FLEET IS PERCEIVED BY ALL STATES IN THE REGION AS A
POTENTIAL THREAT TO THEIR SECURITY. NOW ABLE TO OPERATE
THROUGHOUT ASIA, THE SOVIETS CAN BE EXPECTED TO INCREASE
THEIR REQUESTS FOR PORT CALLS AND TO FIND OTHER MEANS OF
ADVERTISING THEIR INCREASED NAVAL PRESENCE.

126. SOUTH ASIA. SINCE THE APRIL 1978 COUP WHICH BROUGHT
NUR MOHAMMED TARAKI'S LEFTIST GOVERNMENT TO POWER, SOVIET
INTEREST IN THE ASIAN SUB-CONTINENT HAS FOCUSSED ON
AFGHANISTAN. WHILE THE SOVIETS WERE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR
TARAKI'S TAKEOVER, THEY MOVED SWIFTLY TO RECOGNIZE THE NEW
REGIME AND TO PROVIDE POLITICAL, ECONOMIC AND MILITARY
SUPPORT. LARGE NUMBERS OF SOVIET &quot;ADVISORS&quot; HAVE ASSUMED
POSITIONS IN KABUL'S MINISTERIES, AND ARMED FORCES. A
NUMBER OF NEW ECONOMIC AGREEMENTS HAVE BEEN SIGNED, AND
SOVIET MILITARY ASSISTANCE HAS INCREASED.
127. AFGHANISTAN'S LEADERS HAVE DENIED THEY ARE COMMUNISTS
AND HAVE ANNOUNCED THEIR INTENTION TO MAINTAIN THE COUNTRY'S TRADITIONAL NON-ALIGNED POLICY. HOWEVER, TARAKI,
AND HIS PRINCIPAL ASSOCIATE FOREIGN MINISTER AMIN, HAVE
ADOPTED MARXIST RHETORIC AND ARE PURSUING POLICIES WHICH
CAN ONLY INCREASE THEIR RELIANCE ON SOVIET SUPPORT. INCREASED AFGHAN IDENTITY WITH THE &quot;SOCIALIST CAMP&quot; AND ITS
REVIVAL OF THE PUSHTUNISTAN AND BALUCHISTAN ISSUES HAS
UNSETTLED RELATIONS WITH PAKISTAN AND IRAN, AND RAISED
QUESTIONS ABOUT THE STABILITY OF THE ENTIRE REGION.
128. IN THE SHORT TERM, THE SOVIETS WILL PROBABLY BE MORE
INTERESTED IN ASSISTING THE NEW GOVERNMENT TO REMAIN IN
POWER AND TO ESTABLISH ITS CONTROL OVER THE ENTIRE COUNTRY THAN IN SUPPORTING AFGHAN &quot;IRREDENTISM&quot; OR IN EXPANDING THEIR OWN PRESENCE THROUGHOUT THE REGION. WHILE IN
THE LONG RUN, A RADICAL, SOVIET-SUPPORTED AFGHANISTAN
COULD POSE A SECURITY THREAT TO NEIGHBORING STATES,
SOVIET POLICY, AT LEAST IN THE LAST DECADE, HAS AIMED
AT REGIONAL STABILITY.

129. PAKISTAN/INDIA. IMPROVEMENT OF SOVIET RELATIONS
WITH PAKISTAN WILL CONTINUE TO BE RESTRAINED BY MOSCOW'S
INTEREST IN MAINTAINING ITS TRADITIONALLY POSITIVE TIES
WITH INDIA. ALTHOUGH SOVIET-INDIAN RELATIONS HAVE COOLED
SINCE THE BALMY DAYS OF INDIRA GANDHI'S ADMINISTRATION,
THE SOVIETS REMAIN INDIA'S PRINCIPAL ARMS SUPPLIER AND
ENJOY THE BENEFITS OF A STABLE RELATIONSHIP WITH THE
MAJOR STATE IN THE SUB-CONTINENT. RECENTLY, NEW DELHI
HAS SHOWN AN INTEREST IN DIVERSIFYING ITS SOURCES OF
WEAPONS, PARTICULARLY AIRCRAFT, AND IN IMPROVING ITS
RELATIONS WITH PEKING. HOWEVER, IT IS DOUBTFUL THE
INDIANS WILL WANT TO RISK SERIOUSLY UNDERMINING WHAT HAS
BEEN A MUTUALLY BENEFICIAL ASSOCIATION WITH THE SOVIETS. VANCE
