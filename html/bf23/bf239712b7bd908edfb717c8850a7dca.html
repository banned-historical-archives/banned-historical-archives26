		<h3>Tor</h3>
		<p><a href="https://www.torproject.org">Tor</a> is an encrypted anonymising network that makes it harder to intercept internet communications, or see where communications are coming from or going to.</p>
		<p>In order to use the WikiLeaks public submission system as detailed above you can download the Tor Browser Bundle, which is a Firefox-like browser available for Windows, Mac OS X and GNU/Linux and pre-configured to connect using the anonymising system Tor.</p>
		<h4>Tails</h4>
		<p>If you are at high risk and you have the capacity to do so, you can also access the submission system through a secure operating system called <a href="https://tails.boum.org">Tails</a>. Tails is an operating system launched from a USB stick or a DVD that aim to leaves no traces when the computer is shut down after use and automatically routes your internet traffic through Tor. Tails will require you to have either a USB stick or a DVD at least 4GB big and a laptop or desktop computer.</p>

		<h3>Tips</h3>
		<p>Our submission system works hard to preserve your anonymity, but we recommend you also take some of your own precautions. Please review these basic guidelines. </p>
		<div>
			<h4>1. Contact us if you have specific problems</h4>
			<p>If you have a very large submission, or a submission with a complex format, or are a high-risk source, please <a href="#submit_help_contact">contact us</a>. In our experience it is always possible to find a custom solution for even the most seemingly difficult situations.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h4>2. What computer to use</h4>
			<p>If the computer you are uploading from could subsequently be audited in an investigation, consider using a computer that is not easily tied to you. Technical users can also use <a href="https://tails.boum.org">Tails</a> to help ensure you do not leave any records of your submission on the computer.</p>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h4>3. Do not talk about your submission to others</h4>
			<p>If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in source protection – it is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This includes other media organisations.</p>
		</div>

	</div>

		<h3>After</h3>

		<div>
			<h4>1. Do not talk about your submission to others</h4>
			<p>If you have any issues talk to WikiLeaks. We are the global experts in source protection – it is a complex field. Even those who mean well often do not have the experience or expertise to advise properly. This includes other media organisations.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h4>2. Act normal</h4>
			<p>If you are a high-risk source, avoid saying anything or doing anything after submitting which might promote suspicion. In particular, you should try to stick to your normal routine and behaviour.</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h4>3. Remove traces of your submission</h4>
			<p>If you are a high-risk source and the computer you prepared your submission on, or uploaded it from, could subsequently be audited in an investigation, we recommend that you format and dispose of the computer hard drive and any other storage media you used.</p>
			<p>In particular, hard drives retain data after formatting which may be visible to a digital forensics team and flash media (USB sticks, memory cards and SSD drives) retain data even after a secure erasure. If you used flash media to store sensitive data, it is important to destroy the media.</p>
			<p>If you do this and are a high-risk source you should make sure there are no traces of the clean-up, since such traces themselves may draw suspicion.</p>
			<div>
				<h4>4. If you face legal action</h4>
				<p>If a legal action is brought against you as a result of your submission, there are organisations that may help you. The Courage Foundation is an international organisation dedicated to the protection of journalistic sources. You can find more details at <a href="https://www.couragefound.org">https://www.couragefound.org</a>.</p>

		<p>WikiLeaks publishes documents of political or historical importance that are censored or otherwise suppressed. We specialise in strategic global publishing and large archives.</p>
		<p>The following is the address of our secure site where you can anonymously upload your documents to WikiLeaks editors. You can only access this submissions system through Tor. (See our <a href="#submit_help_tor">Tor tab</a> for more information.) We also advise you to read our <a href="#submit_help_tips">tips for sources</a> before submitting.</p>

			<!--<div>
				Copy this address into your Tor browser. Advanced users, if they wish, can also add a further layer of encryption to their submission using <a href="#submit_wlkey">our public PGP key</a>.
			</div>-->
		</div>

		<p>If you cannot use Tor, or your submission is very large, or you have specific requirements, WikiLeaks provides several alternative methods. <a href="#submit_help_contact">Contact us</a> to discuss how to proceed.</p>

KATZ: I AM PREPARED TO PROCEED IN ANY WAY YOU PREFER. I
RAISED WITH MR. SUN SOME SUBJECTS YESTERDAY.
WANG: SECRETARY BLUMENTHAL HAD TALKS WITH VICE PREMIER
YU QUILI AND MINISTER OF FINANCE ZHANGJINFU AND THIS

BETWEEN OUR TWO COUNTRIES, INCLUDING TRADE RELATIONS. I
THINK ALL THESE TALKS HAVE RESOLVED THE PRINCIPLES FOR OUR
TALKS. THUS THE TALKS HAVE ALREADY PASSED THE HALFWAY POINT.
WE THINK OUR WORK IS NOW EASY. (AT THIS POINT VICE MINISTER
WANG INTRODUCED THE CHINESE PARTICIPANTS AND ASSISTANT
SECRETARY KATZ INTRODUCED THE US SIDE)
WANG: USLO HAS HANDED OVER A LIST OF SUBJECTS TO BE CONTAINED
IN THE TRADE AGREEMENT WHICH YOU WISH TO DISCUSS WITH US.
YOU HAD AN EXCHANGE OF VIEWS WITH MR. SUN. SO NOW WE WOULD
LIKE TO LISTEN TO YOUR VIEWS ON THESE ISSUES.
KATZ: THANK YOU. AS SECRETARY BLUMENTHAL SAID THIS MORNING,
OUR PURPOSE IS TO LAY A FOUNDATION ON WHICH WE CAN BUILD
A FAST GROWING TRADE RELATIONSHIP. A TRADE AGREEMENT IS
AN ESSENTIAL ELEMENT IN THIS FOUNDATION. UNDER OUR LAWS,
IT IS NECESSARY THAT MOST FAVORED NATION (MFN) TREATMENT
BE PROVIDED IN THE FRAMEWORK OF A TRADE AGREEMENT. OUR LAWS,
MOREOVER, SPECIFY CERTAIN ELEMENTS WHICH MUST BE PART OF
THAT TRADE AGREEMENT. WHAT WE HOPE TO DO THIS WEEK IS TO
INTRODUCE OUR REQUIREMENTS, EXPLAIN WHAT WE HAVE IN MIND,
EXCHANGE VIEWS, AND PLAN HOW WE SHOULD PROCEED -- LOOKING
FORWARD TO THE CONCLUSION OF A TRADE AGREEMENT. I CONVEYED
TO MR. SUN NINE POINTS WHICH WE BELIEVE ARE REQUIRED OR

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
RELEVANT FOR INCLUSION IN A TRADE AGREEMENT. IF YOU AGREE
THAT THIS CAN FORM THE AGENDA FOR OUR WORK, I WOULD PROPOSE
TO START WITH THE FIRST OF THESE ITEMS, AND THEN DISCUSS THE REST.
DISCUSSIONS CAN BE CONTINUED TOMORROW IF ECESSARY.
WANG: AGREED.
KATZ: THE FIRST ITEM CALLS FOR MUTUAL ASSISTANCE WITH
RESPECT TO TRADE OPPORTUNITIES AND NON-DISCRIMINATORY
TREATMENT INCLUDING MFN AND RECIPROCAL TRADE OPPORTUNITIES.
THE ITEM WE ARE DISCUSSING DEALS WITH THE ROVISION OF MFN
TREATMENT. OUR SIDE, THIS PROVISION IS VERY SIMPLE-ESSENTIALLY, IT IS A STANDARD MFN PROVISION FOUND IN MOST
TRADE AGREEMENTS. WE, OF COURSE, HAVE A TWO-COLUMN
TARIFF SYSTEM, AS YOU MAY KNOW -- ONE COLUMN APPLIES TO MFN;
THE OTHER COLUMN HAS TO DO WITH STATUTORY RATES, WHICH ARE
CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL
PAGE 04

BEIJIN 01333 01 OF 09 100623Z

CONSIDERABLY HIGHER. WE HAVE A REQUIREMENT THAT MFN TREATMENT BE RECIPROCATED ON YOU SIDE BY SOME PROVISIONS TO
ASSURE THAT THEERE ARE EQUIVALENT AND RECIPROCAL TRADE
OPPORTUNITIES IN YOUR MARKET.
FRANKLY SPEAKING, WE DO NOT KNOW MUCH ABOUT YOUR
TARIFF SITUATION. WE UNDERSTAND YOU HAVE A TARRIFF SYSTEM,
BUT WE DO NOT KNOW HOW IT OPERATES. THERE ARE VARIOUS
WAYS WE COULD PROVIDE FOR RECIPROCITY, AS WE HAVE WITH
OTHER COUNTRIES. SOME OF THE RECIPROCITY COULD BE PROVIDED
IN OTHER PROVISIONS IN THE TRADE AGREEMENT, SUCH AS TOSE
COVERING BUSINESS FACILITATION, BUT WE THINK THAT THERE COULD BE
OTHER PROVISIONS DEALING WITH THIS MATTER. FOR EXAMPLE,
THERE COULD BE A DECISION THAT CHINA WILL BASE ITS PURCHASES
FROM THE UNITED STATES SOLELY ON COMMERCIAL TERMS, THAT IS,
PRICE, QUALITY, DELIVERY, AND CREDIT TERMS. WE ALSO WANT
SOME PROVISION THAT THERE WILL BE NO DISCRIMINATION AGAINST
THE US, EITHER BY CHINESE ENTERPRISE OR THE CHINESE
GOVERNMENT -- WHOEVER MAKES IMPORTANT DECISIONS. THAT'S ALL I
WANT TO SAY ABOUT THIS ITEM -- PERHAPS YOU WANT TO COMMENT?
WANG: WE SHARE YOUR VIEWS. SIGNING OF A TRADE AGREEMENT
SHOULD HELP TO DEVELOP TRADE. GRANTING MFN TREATMENT TO

EACH OTHER IS A VERY IMPORTANT ELEMENT. MFN TREATMENT IS
RELATED TO TARIFFS -- WHICH ARE VERY IMPORTANT IN TRADE.
SO WE THINK THE TRADE AGREEMENT MUST EMBODY FACILITATION
FOR TRADE; EMBODY MFN TREATMENT. WE AGREE TO HAVE SUCH
PROVISIONS -- MFN TREATMENT -- IN OUR TRADE AGREEMENT.
WE HAVE IN CHINA TWO TYPES OF TARIFFS -- GENERAL
TARIFFS AND LOW TARIFFS (MFN TARIFFS). THIS IS THE SAME
AS YOUR SYSTEM. FOR OUR PART, THERE IS NO DIFFICULTY TO
STIPULATE N MFN TREATMENT CLAUSE IN THE TRADE AGREEMENT.
AS FOR EXCEPTIONAL CLAUSES IN ADDITION TO MFN TREATMENT,
WE WOULD LIKE TO LISTEN TO YOUR VIEWS. I WOULD LKKE TO
TAKE THIS IOPPORTUNITY TO MAKE ANOTHER POINT, NOT CONNECTED
WITH MFN, BUT ALSO A &quot;FAVORED ITEM.&quot; CHINA SHOULD ENJOY
BENEFICIARY STATUS UNDER GSP FOR DEVELOPING COUNTRIES.
WE HOPE THIS CLAUSE WILL BE INCLUDED IN THE TRADE AGREEMENT.
WE WOULD LIKE TO LISTEN TO YOUR VIEWS ON HOW TO PUT THIS
IN THE TRADE AGREEMENT.

KATZ: LET ME SAY FIRST, WITH RESPECT TO YOUR TARIFFS, AS
WE UNDERSTAND IT, THE CHINESE TARIFF SYSTEM IS NOT A
REGULATOR OF TRADE AS IT IS IN A MARKET ECONOMY SUCH AS
OURS -- ALTHOUGH WE WOULD BE GLAD TO LISTEN TO AN EXPLANATION
OF YOUR TARIFF SYSTEM.
WANG: OUR TARIFF SYSTEM HAS TWO COLUMNS -- GENERAL AND LOW
TARIFFS. THE LOW TARIFFS ARE THE MFN TARIFFS. THIS IN
ITSELF IS AN ASSURANCE FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF TRADE -IT IS BENEFICIAL TO YOUR EXPORTS TO CHINA.
KATZ: DOES AN ENTERPRISE FACED WITH A DECISION ON IMPORT-

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
ING FROM TWO DIFFERENT SOURCES -- DOES THE TARIFF AFFECT
THE DECISION?
WANG: YES. OF COURSE, IT VARIES FROM ONE CASE TO ANOTHER.
WE HAVE MFN AND NON-MFN TARIFFS -- THE TWO RATES DIFFER.
KATZ: DO YOU HAVE THE RATES?
WANG: YES, WE HAVE, BUT NOT IN ENGLISH.
KATZ: PERHAPS THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL.
WANG: YES, WE CAN GIVE THEM TO YOU.
KATZ: I ASSUME YOU ARE WILLING TO CONSIDER THE LANGUAGE
WE WISH TO PROPOSE?
WANG: YES.
KATZ: I SHOULD HAVE STATED AT THE OUTSET THE OBVIOUS -THERE IS A WELL-KNOWN ISSUE RELATING TO MFN EXTENSION
WHICH SECRETARY BLUMENTHAL REFERRED TO THIS MORNING. INDEED
IT WAS DISCUSSED WITH VICE PREMIER DENG XIAOPING BY
PRESIDENT CARTER WHEN HE WAS IN WASHINGTON, DC. AS
SECRETARY BLUMENTHAL RESTATED THIS MORNING, IT IS OUR DESIRE
TO ACCORD CHINESE EXPORTS MFN BECAUSE WE UNDERSTAND IT
IS THE NECESSARY BASIS FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF TRADE. WE
ARE WORKING WITH CONGRESS TO FIND A WAY TO DEAL WITH THIS
LEGAL PROBLEM. SO WE ARE PROCEEDING IN THIS WORKING GROUP
ON THE ASSUMPTION THAT A WAY WILL BE FOUND AROUND THE LEGAL
PROBLEM DURING THE COURSE OF THE YEAR. WE CAN DISCUSS THE
CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL
PAGE 03

BEIJIN 01333 02 OF 09 100649Z

REQUIREMENTS OF A TRADE AGREEMENT, BUT WE ARE NOT DEALING
WITH THE LEGAL PROBLEM IN THIS WORKING GROUP.
WITH RESPECT TO THE QUESTION OF GSP WHICH YOU RAISED,
UNDER OUR LAW THERE ARE SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS FOR ELIGIBILITY
FOR GSP. I ASSUME THESE ARE FAMILIAR TO YOU. ONE REQUIREMENT HAS TO DO WITH MFN -- THE COUNTRY MUST RECEIVE MFN
IN ORDER TO RECEIVE GSP. SECOND, THE COUNTRY MUST BE A
MEMBER OF IMF AND GATT. THIRD, THE COUNTRY MUST NOT BE
DOMINATED OR CONTROLLED BY INTERNATIONAL COMMUNISM. THAT
LATTER IS A HISTORICAL REFERENCE IN A SENSE, INTENDED
REALLY TO MAKE TWO COUNTRIES ELIGIBLE -- POLAND AND YUGOSLAVIA.
AS A PRACTICAL MATTER, IN THE NEAR TERM, IMF AND GATT MEMBERSHIP ARE THE IMMEDIATE PROBLEMS. I WOULD NOT ENCOURAGE YOU
TO EXPECT THAT GSP WOULD BE AVAILABLE IN THE NEAR FUTURE. I
THINK AS A PRACTICAL MATTER -- IN TERMS OF OUR WORK -- WE SHOULD
THINK IN TERMS OF THE OTHER ELEMENTS WHICH WOULD BE INCLUDED
IN THE TRADE AGREEMENT.
WANG: ALL RIGHT. SINCE WE ARE A DEVELOPING COUNTRY, WE
THINK CHINA SHOULD BE ELIGIBLE TO ENJOY GSP TREATMENT -WE PUT THIS FORWARD FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION. IF THERE IS
NOTHING FURTHER TO DISCUSS ON THIS, WE CAN GO ON TO THE
NEXT TOPIC.

KATZ: VERY GOOD. THE NEXT SUBJECT IS TRADE FACILITATION.
WE HAD SOME DISCUSSION ON THIS THIS MORNING. I UNDERSTOOD
MINISTER LI JIANG TO SAY THAT HE FAVORED FACILITATIVE
ARRANGEMENTS FOR BUSINESSMEN. THERE ARE SEVERAL ASPECTS
WHICH I WOULD LIKE TO EXPLAIN. WE THINK THE TRADE AGREEMENT
SHOULD ESTABLISH PRINCIPLES FOR EQUITABLE PARTICIPATION
BY FIRMS AND ENTERPRISES OF BOTH COUNTRIES IN THE OTHER
COUNTRY WITH RESPECT TO A NUMBER OF SERVICES. THIS INCLUDES
TRANSPORTATION, INSURANCE, FINANCIAL MATTERS, TECHNICAL
ADVICE, ADVERTISING, AND OTHER THINGS. ALSO, TO PERMIT
TRADE RELATIONS TO FLOURISH, IT IS IMPORTANT TO HAVE AVAILCONFIDENTIAL

ABLE INFORMATION CONCERNING LAWS, REGULATIONS, AND STATISTICS
WITH RESPECT TO EACH COUNTRY. THIS MORNING THERE WERE DISCUSSIONS CONCERNING THE ESTABLISHMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE
OFFICES IN EACH COUNTRY. WE BELIEVE THAT THE TRADE AGREMENT
SHOULD PROVIDE FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT OFSUCH OFFICES, INCLUDING PROVISIONS FOR OFFICE SPACE, IMPORTATION OF PERSONAL
EFFFECTS,AUTOMOBILES, ENTRY AND EXIT, HIRING AND COMPENSATION
OF LOCAL PERSONNEL, IMPORTATION OF SAMPLES, AND SO FORTH.
WE THINK THESE MTTERS SHOULD BE INCLUDED IN THE TRADE
AGREEMENT. BECAUSE THESE THINGS FACILITATE THE DEVELOPMENT
OF TRADE, WE BELIEVE WE SHOULD DEVOTE PARTICULAR ATTENTION
TO THIS QUESTION AND PERHAPS CONCLUDE AN INTERIM AGREEMENT
IN ADVANCE OF THIS TRADE AGREEMENT. IF WE CAN PROGRESS
RAPIDLY, THIS ISPERHAPS A MATTER THAT SECRETARY KREPS COULD
CONCLUDE DURING HER VISIT. THERE ARE TWO OTHER MATTERS
WHICH SHOULD BE COVERED IN THIS AREA. ONE IS GOVERNMENT
TRADE OFFICES (PREVIOUSLY I WAS TALKING ABOUT PRIVATE
ENTERPRISES). WE SHOULD MAKE PROVISIONS FOR GOVERNMENT
OFFICES. ESSENTIALLY, THESE OFFICES, IN BEIJING AND
WASHINGTON, DC, WOULD BE INTEGRAL PARTS OF OUR RESPECTIVE
EMBASSIES, ALTHOUGH THEY COULD BE LOCATED IN SEPARATE
PREMISES. THE COMMERCIAL OFFICERS OF THESE OFFICES WOULD
BE PART OF THE EMBASSY DIPLOMATIC STAFF WITH ALL THE STATUS
OF EMBASSY OFFICIALS -- THEY WOULD ENJOY DIPLOMATIC STATUS. AS TO
THE FUNCTIONS OF THESE OFFICES, WE WOULD PROPOSE (FOR THE US) THAT
THEY WOULD SUPPORT EXHIBITS OF US PRODUCTS AND OTHER KINDS
OF TRADE PROMOTION ACTIVITIES. THEY WOULD ASSIST BOTH
AMERICAN BUSINESSMEN AND CHINESE ORGANIZATIONS INTERESTED
IN SALES OR OTHER COMMERCIAL TRANSACTIONS -- BOTH IMPORTS
AND EXPORTS. ONE TING WE ARE PREPARED TO OFFER ON AN
EARLY BASIS IS SEMINARS WITH RESPECT TO PARTICULAR INDUSTRIES
OR PRODUCTS WHICH WOULD BE OF INTEREST TO YOUR ORGANIZATIONS.

PRINCIPLE OF AN AGREEMENT.WE THINK BOTH SIDES CAN SET UP

WILL SEND OURS TO WASHINGTON, DC AND YOURS TO BEIJING.
FOR OUR PART, HOWEVER, THERE EXIST TECHNICAL PROBLEMS. WE
LACK HOTEL ACCOMODATIONS. NEVERTHELESS, WE HAVE ALREADY
OFFEREED CONVENIENCES AND FACILITIES FOR AMERICAN BUSINESSMENT, FOR EXAMPLE, FOR SOME TECHNICIANS WHO HAVE STAYED IN
CHINA FOR A LONG TIME TO OFFER TECHNICAL SEMINARS. WE
EXTENED THEIR VISAS FROM TIME TO TIME AND OFFEREED THEM
FACILITIES. WE HAVE NO AGREEMENT, BUT WE CAN AGREE ON
THE AGREEMENT. AS FOR RESIDENT REPRESENTATIVES IN OTHER
CITIES IN CHINA, WE CAN STUDY THE PSSIBILITIES IN ACCORD
WITH OUR WORKING REQUIREMENTS. WE CAN OFFER FACILITIES
AND CONVENIENCES FOR ALL BUSINESSMEN IF REQUIRED. AS A
MATTER OF FACT, WE HAVE ALREADY OFFERED CONVENIENCES BENEFICIAL TO BOTH SIDES. YOUR USLO OFFICER IS VERY FAMILIAR

EMBASSIES WHICH ENJOY DIPLOMATIC STATUS. WE CAN OFFER
FACILITIES AND CONVENIENCES TO EITHER PRIVATE ENTERPRISES
OR OFFICIAL REPRESENTATIVES. AS A MATTER OF FACT, WE ARE
ALREADY DOING SO. WE THINK IT IS NECESSARY TO INCLUDE A
CLAUSE IN THE AGREEMENT AND WE ARE PREPARED TO PERMIT YOU TO
ESTABLISH
CONSULATES GENERAL WITH COMMERCIAL OFFICES IN OTHER PARTS
OF OUR COUNTRY. ACCORDING TO AMERICAN PRACTICE, WOULD
THESE CONSULATES GENERAL INCLUDE COMMERCIAL REPRESENTATIVES?
KATZ: YES.
WANG: WE WILL PROVIDE CONVENIENCES FOR BUSINESSMEN.
KATZ: I AM PLEASED WITH YOUR RESPONSE. BOTH GOVERNMENT
AND PRIVATE OFFICES ARE NECESSARY TO PROVIDE ASSISTANCE FOR
DOING BUSINESS. BUT GOVERNMENT OFFICES CAN BE BERY HELPFUL
TO YOU -- IN THE SERVICES THEY CAN PROVIDE TO YOU. AS WELL AS
TO PRIVATE BUSINESSMEN. I THINK YOU WOULD FIND, FOR EXAMPLE,
THAT OUR COMMERCIAL OFFICE IN BEIJING WOULD BE WELL EQUIPPED
WITH INFORMATION ABOUT ALL US BUSINESSES AND INDUSTRIES.
IF YOU WANTED INFORMATION ABOUT A SPECIFIC PRODUCT OR INDUSTRY,
YOU COULD GO THERE TO FIND CATALOGS.
WANG: YES, WE HOPE SO.
KATZ: THIS CAN BE A USEFUL POINT OF CONTACT IF YOU WANT TO
LEARN MORE ABOUT WHAT IS AVAILABLE IN THE US CONCERNING
A PARTICULAR FIRM OR INDUSTRY.
WANG: ALONG WITH THE ESTABLISHMENT OF COMMERCIAL REPRESENTATION,
THER WILL BE A LOT OF ROUTINE WORK. IF WE ESTABLISHED COMMERCIAL
REPRESENTATION IN THE US, WE WOULD WISH TO ENJOY SUITABLE
FACILITIES. THIS SHOULD BE RECIPROCAL. FOR OUR PART, THERE
IS NO DIFFICULTY.WE THINK IT IS NECESSARY TO HAVE TECHNICAL
SEMINARS TO PROMOTE MUTUAL UNDERSTANDING. THE CHINA COUNCIL
FOR THE PROMOTION OF INTERNATIONAL TRADE (CCPIT) IS IN CHARGE
OF THIS WORK. THE MINISTRY OF FOREIGN TRADE SUPPORTS SUCH

SEMINARS. REPRESENTATIVES FROM FACTORIES AND INDIVIDUAL
DEPARTMENTS HAVE ATTENDED SEMINARS SPONSORED BY AMERICAN FIRMS.
KATZ: THE NEXT SUBJECT HAS TO DO WITH FINANCIAL PROVISIONS.
WE THINK IT IS DESIRABLE TO COVER PROVISIONS CONCERNING PAYMENTS, REMITTANCE OF CURRENCY, RATES OF EXCHANGE, BANKING
RELATIONS, AND SIMILAR MATTERS. WE MIGHT ALSO HAVE PROVISIONS
FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT OF BRANCH BANKS OF EACH COUNTRY IN THE
OTHER COUNTRY. IN HIS MEETING YESTERDAY WITH THE MINISTER OF
FINANCE, SECRETARY BLUMENTHAL SAID HE HOPED TO SEE A SIGN
SAYING &quot;BANK OF CHINA&quot; ON WALL STREET. WITHOUT PLAYING FAVORITESN
WE HOPE TO SEE A SIGN SAYING &quot;BANKS OF AMERICA&quot; IN CHINA (BECAUSE
WE HAVE MORE THAN ONE COMMERCIAL BANK).
WANG: WE THINK THIS SUBJECT FALLS WITHIN THE AREA OF BANKING
BUSINESS; YOU SHOULD CONTACT THE BANK OF CHINA. MAYBE THE US
FRIENDS ARE AWARE THAT WE HAVE ESTABLISHED A BRANCH BANK IN
LONDON. VERY SOON. WE ARE PREPARING TO ESTABLISH A BRANCH
BANK IN LUXEMBOURG. WE THINK YOU MAY RECEIVE AN EXPLANATION

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
FROM THE BANK OF CHINA ABOUT THE BUSINESS
REQUIREMENTS. IF IT IS NECESSARY TO INCLUDE PROVISIONS
IN THE TRAE AGREEMENT, WE CAN STUDY THAT.
KATZ: THE WORKING GROUP ON BAKING PROBLEMS IS DISCUSSING
THIS SAME MATTER -- THERE IS NO NEED FOR US TO DISCUSS
THIS IN DETAIL.
WANG: YES.
KATZ: WE HAVE PROVISIONS LIKE THIS IN OTHER TRADE AGREEMENTS
AS YOU MAY BE AWARE. THEY ARE NOT VERY COMPLEX. WE WILL
GIVE YOU A COPY.
WANG: TO DEVELOP TRADE, WE NEED CREDIT. WE WONDER WHETHER
YOU CAN OFFER FACILITIES FOR PROVIDING CREDIT?
KATZ: WE THINK IT IS QUITE NORMAL TO PROVIDE FOR CREDIT
FACILITIES. WE UNDERSTAND THAT GIVEN YOUR STATE OF ECONOMIC
DEVELOPMENT AND TRADE DEVELOPMENT, CREDIT WOULD PLAY AN
IMPORTANT ROLE. INDEED, THERE WAS SOME DISCUSSION OF THIS
MATTER BETWEEN SECRETARY BLUMENTHAL AND THE MIISTER OF
FINANCE. AT THE MOMENT, THERE ARE SOME LEGAL PROBLEMS AND
CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL
PAGE 04

BEIJIN 01333 03 OF 09 100712Z

FINANCIAL OBSTACLES. WE ASSUME THAT IN TIME THESE WILL BE
OVERCOME. I SHOULD EMPHASIZE THAT WE ARE SPEAKING OF
OFFICIAL CREDITS, NOT PRIVATE CREDITS.
WANG: IF YOU REMOVE ALL THE OBSTACLES, THEN THERE WILL BE NO PROBLEM?
KATZ: THERE IS ONLY ONE REMINING PROBLEM -- MONEY*
(LAUGHTER)
WANG: YOU CAN OFFER CREDIT FACILITIES?
KATZ: WE CAN EXPECT THATAFTER THE PROBLEMS ARE RESOLVED,
WE CAN OFFER CREDIT FACILITIES. TO BE VERY CLEAR, I SHOULD
MAKE THREE POINTS. FIRST, THERE IS A LEGAL PROBLEM SIMILAR
TO MFN. I ASSUME THAT WHEN THE PROBLEM OF ONE IS RESOLVED
(MFN), THE OTHER WILL BE RESOLVED AT THE SAME TIME (CREDITS).
SECOND, RELATIONS NEED TO BE DEVELOPED WITH THE EXPORT
IMPORT BANK, WHICH IS OUR CREDIT AGENCY. IT IS A PART OF
THE US GOVERNMENT, BUT OPERATES INDEPENDENTLY UTILIZING
PRINCIPLES OF CREDIT WORTHINESS, AND SO FORTH. AND THERE
IS AN ISSUE OF OUTSTANDING DEBT WHICH NEEDS TO BE RESOLVED.
THIRS,AND THIS PURELY AN AMERICAN PROBLEM, IS TO FIND
THE MONEY. AT PRESENT, THE EXPORT IMPORT BANK IS LIMITED
IN ITS RESOURCES. IT HAS DEMANDS WHICH EXCEED ITS RESOURCES
(MONEY) BY THREE TIMES. WE THINK THIS IS A PROBLEM WHICH
CAN BE RESOLVED. IT REQUIRES SOME TIME AND THE RESOLUTION
OF THE EARLIER ISSUES I REFERRED TO.
KATZ: THE NEXT SUBJECT -- UNDER THE TRADE ACT OF 1974,
WE REQUIRE CERTAIN PROVISIONS WHICH ARE NECESSARY TO PROTECT
OUR MARKET FROM DISRUPTION OF IMPORTS. ESSENTIALLY, THESE
PROVISIONS REQUIRE THAT THERE BE BILATERAL CONSULTATIONS
IN AN EFFORT TO RESOLVE THE PROBLEM ON A MUTUALLY SATISFACTORY
BASIS. IF THE PROBLEM CAN NOT BE RESOLVED ON A MUTUALLY
SATISFACTORY BASIS, WE NEED THE RIGHT TO TAKE UNILATERAL

DIFFERENT FROM THE TEXTILE PROBLEM WHICH WE HAVE BEEN
DISCUSSING RECENTLY, EXCEPT THAT TEXTILES IS PERHAPS THE
MOST AGGRAVATED PROBLEM OF TRADE. THE REASON IS THAT ORLD
TEXTILE TRADE IS SO LARGE, EVERY COUNTRY HAS PROBLEMS WITH
TEXTILE IMPORTS SO THIS PROBLEMS IS TAKING ON MULTINATIONAL
OR INTERNATIONAL CHARACTERISTICS.THE OTHER CASES WILL NOT BE
AS LARGE. ONLY ONE CASE HAS BEEN BROUGHT UNDER THIS PROVISION,
AND NO ACTION WAS TAKEN. THE OBJECT IS TO PROVIDE A PROCEDURE
WHICH WILL DIMINISH PROBLEMS RATHRR THAN TO PERMIT THEM TO
BECOME WORSE. THE ESSENTIAL INGREDIENT IS TO FIND A MUTUAL
SOLUTION. RATHER THAN TO TAKE UNILATERAL ACTION.
WANG: WE THINK THIS IS A TWO-PART PROBLEM. ONE PART RELATES
TO THE LAWS IN FORCE, THE OTHER PART ISTHE ACTUAL PRACTICES.
WE HOPE THERE WILL NOT BE PROTECTION PROVISIONS IN THE TRADE
AGREEMENT. IF YOU INSIST, WE WILL CONSIDER HOW TO DEVELOP
APPROPRIATE WORDING FOR SUCH A PROVISION IN THE AGREEMENT
WE THINK THAT, IN ORDER TO DEVELOP TRADE, WE CAN SOLVE PROBLEMS
THROUGH MUTUAL CONSULTATION. WE HOPE YOU WILL NOT OVERESTIMATE

EXAMPLE, TEXTILES, WE HAVE ONLY A LIMITED QUANITYT FOR
EXPORT. WE HOPE YOU WILL OFFER US A REASONABLE QUOTAM.
CONSUMER GOODS ARE THE MAIN ITEMS OF OUR EXPORTS -- THEY
ACCOUNT FOR A BIG PROPORTION OF OUR TRADE, BUT ONLY A SMALL
PART OF THE US MARKET. WE MUST START FROM THE ACTUAL
CIRCUMSTANCES. RECENTLY, WE SENT A TEXTILE GROUP TO THE
TO HAVE CONSULTATIONS WITH YOU. THIS SHOWS WE WISH
TO SOLVE PROBLEMS THROUGH CONSULTATIONS. WE HOPE YOU
WILL CONSIDER THIS PROBLEM POSITIVELY, WHICH WILL BE
BENEFICIAL TO TRADE.
KATZ: LET ME EMPHASIZE, OUR OBJECTIVE IS NOT TO BUILD
PROTECTIONISM INTO THE AGREEMENT, BUT TO AVOID HAVING TO
RESORT TO PROTECTIONISM. ESSENTIALLY WE DO THAT BY
PROVIDINGFOR APROCEDURE FOR CONSULTATIONS SO SMALL
PROBLEMS DO NOT BECOME WORSE OR UNMANAGEABLE.
WANG: WE THINK IT IS BETTER NOT TO PUT A PROTECTIONIST
CLAUSE IN THE AGREEMENT.
KATZ: WE HAVE A REQUIREMENT FOR SUCH A CLAUSE (READS
PASSAGE FOROM SECTION 405 OF THE TRADE ACT). AS A PRACTICAL
MATTER, WE ARE REQUIRED BY LAW TO PUT SUCH A PROVISION IN
THE AGREEMENT, BUT, IN FACT, WE THINK THAT SUCH LANGUAGE
IS HELPFUL TO YOU RATHER THANHARMFUL TO YOU. IT IS NOT
OUR PRACTICE, AS IS THE CASE OF SOME COUNTRIES, TO PUT
LIMITS IN THE AGREEMENT ON WHAT YOU CAN SELL TO US. WE
DO NOT WANT TO DO THAT, BUT WE MUST HAVE SOME PROCEDURE
FOR DEALING WITH PROBLEMS IF SUCH PROBLEMS ARISE OR
THREATEN TOARISE -- ESPECIALLY TO PROVIDE FOR CONSULTATIONS
TO FINA A MUTUAL SOLUTION. BUT IF THEY ARE NOT RESOLVED,
WE MUST HAVE THE RIGHT TO TTAKE ACTION. WE CAN PROVIDE
SOME TEXTS WHICH YOU CAN SEE ARE NOT PROTECTIONIST -- WHICH
ARE NOT RESTRICTIVE, BUT ASSIST IN RESOLVING PROBLEMS.

ORDER TO DEVELOP TRADE, WHEN WE HAVE PROBLEMS WE NEED TO

FROM OUR SIDE, WE DO NOT TINK THAT WE WILL CAUSE MARKET
DISRUPTIONS.

A NATION OF 900 MILLION PRODUCERS;.
WANG: OR, WE CAN SAY WE HAVE 900 MILLION CONSUMERS AS WELL*

KATZ: WHAT WE ARE PROPOSING WILL NOT BE A PROBLEM.
WANG: WE WILL STUDY THIS FURTHER. WE HOPE ALL THE WORDING
WILL BE POSITIVE -- NOT NEGATIVE. WE WILL STUDY THE ACTUAL
WORDING TO DEVELOP A CLAUSE.
KATZ: THE NEXT SUBJECT RELATES TO COPYRIGHTS, PATENTS, AND

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
INDUSTRIAL PROPERTY. SUCH A CLAUSE IS REQUIRED BY OUR LAW.
SPECIFICALLY, WE WANT TREATMENT EQUIVALENT TO THAT PROVIDED
IN THE PARIS CONVENTION AND THE INDUSTRIAL PROPERTY
CONVENTION. IN THE MEETING THIS MORNING, YOUR MINISTER SAID
THAT YOU PROVIDED SUCH PROTECTON. BUT IT WOULD BE DESIRABLE -ESSENTIAL-- TO HAVE SUCH A PROVISION SET OUT IN THE TRADE
AGREEMENT TO GIVE CONFIDENCE TO OUR INVESTORS AND TRADEERS.
I UNDERSAND TAHT YOU ARECONSIDERING JOINING THESE TWO
CONVENTIONS. I ASSUME THAT THE SECRETARIATS OF THESE
TWO CONVENTIONS HAVE PROVIDED TECHNICAL ADVICE ON THE LAWS
ANDREGULATIONS THAT ARENECESSARY. IN ADDITION, WE HAVE EXPERTS
IN OUR
GOVERNMENT WHICH COULD ASSIST IN THIS IF
REQUIRED. WE ARE VERY INTERESTED IN HEARING WHAT THE
POSSIBILITIES AARE IN THIS AREA AND THE STATUS OF YOUR
NEGOTIATIONS WITH THESE TWO ORGANIZATIONS.
WANG: WE HAVE A RELEVANT DEPARTMENT HANDLING PATENTS
AND COPYRIGHT AFFAIRS. AS FOR THE PARIS CONVENTION, THE
DEPARTMENTS CONCERNED ARE ACTIVELY CONSIDERING THIS. IN
THE PAST FEW YEARS, WE DID NOT HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO
CONSIDER THIS &quot;DUE TO A NUMBER OF REASONS&quot;. WE ARE NOW
ENGAGED IN INTERNATIONAL ACTIVITIES. THE ORGANIZATIONS

PAGE 04

BEIJIN 01333 04 OF 09 100736Z

CONCERNED ARE ACTIVELY CONSIDERING THIS SUBJECT. EVEN
THOUGH WE HAVE NOT PARTICIPAED IN THE PARIS CONVENTION,
WE HAVE ACTIVELY PROTECTED PATENTS. WE ABIDE BY THE
CONVENTION BY HONORINGCONTRACTS SIGNED BY ENTITIES OF
BOTH COUNTRYES. WE HAVE IMPORTED PATENTS FROM JAPAN AND
OTHER COUNTRIES, AND SO FAR THERE HAVE BEEN NO COMPLAINTS
CONCERNING OUR
FAILURE TO HONOR THE CONTRACTS. BUT THIS
DOES NOT EXCLUDE THE POSSIBILITY THAT CHINA WILL PARTICIPATE
IN THIS CONVENTION. YOU CAN HAVE FULL CONFIDENCE IN CHINA.
WHEN WE SIGN THE TRADE AGREEMENT, WE WILL NOT NECESSARILY
BE ALREADY PARTICPATING IN THE PARIS CONVENTION -- THESE
ARE TWO DIFFERENT THINGS. WE CAN CONSIDER THE WORDING -HOW TO EXPRESS THIS IN THE TRADEE AGREEMENT.
COPYRIGHTS AREHANDLED BY ANOTHER DEPARTMENT. AT
PRESENT, MANY OTHER DEPARTMENTS IN CHINA ARE NEGOTIATING
WITH THEIR COUNTERPARTS ON THE US SIDE, FOR EXAMPLE,
IN SCIENCE ANDTECHNOLOGY AND CULTURE. MAYBE THIS WILL
BE COVERED IN OTHER AGREEMENTS.
KATZ: I THINK THAT FROM WHAT YOU SAY, WE CAN FIND WORDING
TO MEET OUR LEGAL RQUIREMENTS AND TO SATISFY THE CONFIDENCE
OF TRADERS AND INVESTORS. IF IT WERE INCLUDED IN THE AGREEMENT, IT WOULD NOT BE NECESSARY TO HAVE THIS IN THE S&amp;T AREA.
BUT ITHINK IT WILL BE POSSIBLE TO FIND SOMEWORDING WHICH
WILL BE ACCEPTABLE TO BOTH SIDES.

WANG: PLEASE EXPLAIN WHAT THAT MEANS.
KATZ: ESSENTIALLY IT COVERS ONLY NATIONAL SECURITY. IF
EITHERCOUNTRYFELT THAT ITS NATIONAL SECURITY WAS THREATENED,
IT COULD SUSPEND THE PROVISIONS OF THE AGREEMENT. THIS IS
AN OVERRIDING PROVISION.
WANG: THIS IS ONLY CONNECTED WITH THE TERMS AND RESPOSIBILITIES
OF THE TRADEAGREEMENT?
KATZ: YES, ALTHOUGH THERE IS A QUESION OF EXPORT CONTROL
WHICH WE MAINTAIN FOR NATIONAL SECURITY REASONS.
WANG: WE DON'T THINK THAT THERE EXISTS SUCH A PROBLEM -BECAUSE YOUR EXPORTER SIGNS CONTRACTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH
US LAWS AND REGULATIONS. SO WE THINK THAT THE US
GOVERNMENT SHOULD OFFER FACILITATION TO BUSINESSMEN. WE
THINK THIS CLAUSE IS CONTRARY TO THE DESIRE TO DEVELOP TRADE.

COULD NOT HONOR THE AGREEMENT FOR NATIONAL SECURITY REASONS.
WANG: WETHINK BOTH SIDES SHOULD HAVE FURTHER CONSULTATIONS
ON THIS SUBJECT. FROM THE STANDPOINT OF THE ACTUAL SITUATION, SOME MEASURES THATTHE US GOVERNMENT HAS TAKEN
HAVE NOT BEEN BENEFICIAL TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF TRADE. WE
HAVE SIGNED A NUMBER OF CONTRACTS WITH AMERICAN FIRMS FOR
WHICH THE US GOVERNMENT HAS REFUSED TO GRANT EXPORT
LICENSES. SO THE CONTRACTS ARE STILL OUTSTANDING - THEY

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
CAN NOT BE HONORED. FOR SOME ITEMS, THE PROBLEM WAS
SOLVED BUT IT TOOK A LONG TIME. SOME OF YOUR PRODUCTS
ARE ADVANCED IN TECHNOLOGY, THAT IS, YOU ARE COMPETITIVE
IN THIS AREA. IF YOU IMPOSE RESTRICTIONS ON EXPORTS,
YOU LIMITEDYOUR ABILITY TO EXPORT (LAUGHTER). ADVANCED
TECHNOLOGY PRODUCTS FROM THE US HAVE BEEN IMPORTANT
IN OUR TRADE AND THEY ARE REQUIRED FOR THE FOUR MODERNIZATIONS. IF WE INTRODUCE HIGH TECHNOLOGY PRODUCTS FROM TH
US, THIS WILL RAISE THE STANDARDS OF THE FOUR MODERNIZATIONS. WE DON'T THINK THIS WILL THREATEN THE US
THE MOREPOWERFUL CHINA IS, THE MORE THIS WILL CONTRIBUTE
TO THE US SECURITY.
KATZ: UNFORTUNATELY, WE LIVE IN AN IMPERFECT WORLD. IT
IS A MATTER OF MUCH REGRET THAT WE MUST SPEND SO MUCH OF
OUR RESOURCES, EVEN HUMAN LIFE, IN WHAT WE REGARD AS
NATIONAL SECURITY. WE LIVE WITH THREATSTOSECURITY.
SOME AE REAL; SOME PERHAPS ARE NOT REAL, BUT THEY ARE
PERCIEIVED AS REAL. WE ALL TAKE MEASURES TO PROTECT OUR
SECURITY. WE HAVE TRIED TO REDUCE THE THREAT IN VARIOUS
WAYS -- THROUGH WORK IN THE UNITED NATIONS AND INDEVELOPING
RELATIONS WITH COUNTRIESAND REGIONS OF THE WORLD, THROUGH
DISARMAMENT, THROUGH THE TREATIES ON NUCLEAR NON-PROLIFERATION,
BUT DESPITE THESE EFFORTS, THERE ARE PROBLEMS AND THREATS
THAT REMAIN. SO, MAYBE THIS PROVISION IS INCONSISTENT WITH
THE GENERAL THRUST OF OUR EFFORTS WHICH PROVIDE FOR THE
EXPANSION OF TRADE, BUT HERE WE MAY IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES

HAVE TO SUSPEND AN AGREEMENT. THIS IS A DELIBERATE EFFORT,
WHICH WE FEEL ISREQUIRED.
WANG: I WOULD LIKE TO SAY A FEW WORD WHICH ARE ON ANOTHER,
UNRELATED, SUBJECT. YOU WANT TO LIMIT STRATEGIC WEAPONS.
YET THE MORE YOU LIMIT THEM, THE MORE YOU STRENGTHEN &quot;THE OTHER
COUNTRY.&quot;
DISARMAMENT IS NOT MUTUAL. SUCH A PROBLEM
THAT CONGRESS MIGHT TAKE SUCH A NEGATIVE ACTON. AGAIN,
THIS IS ATECHNICAL, LEGAL REQUIREMENT RATHER THAN A
POINT OF GREAT SUBSTANCE.
WANG: GOOD.
KATZ: THE LAST POINT IS INDUSTRIAL COOPERATION AND INVESTMENT.
HERE, WE THOUGHT ITWOULD BE DESIRABLE TO PUT IN PROVISIONS
ON THESE SUBJECTS WHICH WOULD PROMOTE AND FOSTER INVESTMENT.
WE ARE VERY INTERESTED AND PLEASED WITH THEDISCUSSIONS UNDERWAY WITH US FIRMS WITH RESPECT TO MAJOR INDUSTRIAL CORPORATIONS. WE WERE VERY INTERESTED IN HEARING THEPLANS OF THE
MINISTER AND VICE PREMIER YU QIULI CONCERNING COMPENSATION
TRADE, JOINT VENTURES, COPRODUCTION, AND SO FORTH. OUR
THOUGHT WAS THAT WE COULD INCLUDE PROVISIONS IN THE AGREEMENT
TO ENCOURAGE THESE ARRANGEMENTS. FRANKLY, WE HAVE NO LANGUAGE
PREPARED ON THIS, BUT WE WANT TO GET YOUR REACTION TO PUTTING

THIS TYPE OF LANGUAGE IN THE AGREEMENT.
WANG: WE ARE CONSIDERING LAWS ON ALL THESE SUBJECTS. OUT
STATE CORPORATIONS HAVE ALREADY SIGNED AGREEMENTS WITH
AMERICAN FIRMS AND OTHER FOREIGN FIRMS. WE THINK THESE ARE
LEGAL. IT TAKES TIME FOR US TO MAKE LAWS CONCERNING INVESTMENT, COMPENSTATION TRADE, JOINT VENTURES, AND COPRODUCTION.
IN ORDER TO EXPRESS OUR JOINT DESIRE, WE CAN INCLUDESUCH

ONE WAS SUFFICIENTLY DISCUSSED THIS MORNING -- TEXTILES.

BE ABLE TO READ THIS. LET ME SAY THAT THE DISCUSSIONS
YESTERDAY COVERED QUITE A LOT OF GROUND -- ALL THE ELEMENTS
WE THINK SHOULD BE IN A TRADE AGREEMENT. THE NEXT STEP,
I THINK, WOULD BE TO LOOK AT SOME ACTUAL LANGUAGE, RATHER
THAN STUDYING THESE PROVISIONS IN GENERAL. I WOULD LIKE
TO PROPOSE THAT SOME DAYS AFTER WE LEAVE, EITHER WE PROVIDE
LANGUAGE ON OUR SIDE, OR IF YOU HAVE LANGUAGE, WE EXCHANGE
DRAFTS. THAT IS, ON MARCH 15, SAY, EXCHANGE DRAFTS AND,
IF CONVENIENT, A MONTH OR SO AFTER THAT PLAN TO HAVE THE
FIRST MEETING. I THINK, TO MAKE OUR WORK MOST EFFICIENT,
WE MIGHT PLAN TO HAVE TEXTS OF A DRAFT AGREEMENT TO
ALLOW TIME FOR CONSIDERATION AND TO ALLOW TIME FOR AN
EXCHANGE OF VIEWS THROUGH DIPLOMATIC CHANNELS -- THAT IS
THROUGH OUR NEW EMBASSIES. THEN, WE CAN PLAN FOR A
MEETING AFTER THAT. WE WOULD WELCOME A CHINESE DELEGATION
TO VISIT WASHINGTON TO DISCUSS THESE MATTERS.
WANG: YOU ARE PROPOSING TO EXCHANGE A DRAFT AGREEMENT
ON MARCH 15 AND IN ANOTHER TWO OR THREE WEEKS OR A MONTH
LATER TO MEET TO EXCHANGE PRELIMINARY VIEWS.
KATZ: YES. IN THAT TWO TO THREE WEEK PERIOD THERE MIGHT
BE SOME QUESTIONS OR PROBLEMS, AND WE CAN EXCHANGE VIEWS
THROUGH OUR RESPECTIVE EMBASSIES.
WANG: IN PRINCIPLE, WE AGREE TOEXCHANGE DRAFT AGREEMENTS
ON MARCH 15. TWO OR THREE WEEKS AFTER EXCHANGING DRAFT
AGREEMENTS WE CAN HAVE AN INITIAL EXCHANGE OF VIEWS
THROUGH THE US EMBASSY IN BEIJING.(DISCUSSION AMONG
THE CHINESE -- NOT TRANSLATED -- ABOUT THE TIMING OF THE
KREPS VISIT).
WANG: WE HAVE INVITED MRS. KREPS ON MAY 7. SO FAR WE HAVE

WANG: WE WILL LEAVE THIS OPEN?
KATZ YES, BUT WITH THE UNDERSTTANDING THAT IT WILL BE
SOMETIME IN APRIL.
WANG: GOOD.
KATZ: IN HELPING US TO DEVELOP OUR THOUGHTS ON THE AGREEMENT, I HAVE SOME QUESTIONS WHICH I WOULD LIKE TO PUT TO
YOU.
FIRST, IT WOULD BE HELPFUL TO HAVE SOME ESTIMATE OF
YOUR EXPECTATIONS OF TOTAL EXPORTS AND IMPORTS OVER THE
NEXT TWO TO THREE SAARS WITH RESPECT TO AGRICULTURE ON
THE ONE HAND AND INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTS ON THE OTHER.
WANG: AS A WHOLE WE THINK FOREIGN TRADE WILL DEVELOP
FURTHER TOGETHER WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF OUR NATIONAL
ECONOMY. ALL THE STATISTICS ANDSIMILAR INFORMATION ARE
HANDLED BY THE STATISTICAL DEPARTMENTS, BUT THEY HAVE
NOT PUBLISHED THE STATISTICS. JUST RECENTLY, SOME
STATISTICS FOR SOME MAJOR ITEMS OF OUR NATIONAL ECONOMY
HAVE BEEN PUBLISHED, BUT WE HAVE NOT GOT THE STATISTICAL
PICTURE OF THE WHOLE ECONOMY. OUR TRADE FIGURES, W
THINK THESE ARE OPEN TO THE PUBLIC BECAUSE TRADE IS
TWO-WAY. ALTHOUGH SOME FIGURES HAVE BEEN PUBLISHED,
THE METHODS OF CALCULATION VARY FROM ONE COUNTRY TO
ANOTHER -- SO THE FIGURES DON'T AGREE. BUT USUALLY
THERE IS NOT MUCH DIFFERENCE. IN LINE WITH OUR REQUIREMENTS
WE THINK THAT FOREIGN TRADE ILL BE EXPANDINGALONG WITH
THE NATIONAL ECONOMY. INDUSTRIAL OUTPUT WILL INCREASE
BY ABOUT10 PERCENT ANNUALLY. AGRICULTURAL OUTPUT WILL
INCREASE BY FOUR TO FIVE PERCENT ON AN ANUAL BASIS.
DEPENDINGON THE RATE OF GROWTH OF INDUSTRIAL OUTPUT AND
CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL
PAGE 03

BEIJIN 01333 07 OF 09 100841Z

AGRICULTURAL OUTPUT, WE THINK FOREIGN TRADE WILL DEVELOP
ON THE AVERAGE ABOUT 10 PERCENT ANNUALLY. IN THE INITIAL
STAGES, IMPORTS WILL BE GREATER THAN EXPORTS. WE WISH
TO DEVELOP FOREIGN TRADE, BUT FUNDS ARE INSUFFICIENT.
SOME COUNTRIES ARE OFFERING US CREDIT. THAT'S WHY IMPORTS
WILL BE GREATER THAN EXPORTS FOR SOME TIME IN THE FUTURE.
HOWEVER, IN A FEW YEARS, OUR EXPORTS MAY EXCEED OUR IMPORTS
BECAUSE WE HAVE TO PAY BACK OUR DEBT. THIS IS THE GENERAL
IDEA. SINO-US TRADE WILL REGISTER A REMARKABLE ACHIEVE-

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
MENT. VICE PREMIER DENG XIAOPING SAID DURING HIS STAY
IN THE UNITED STATES THAT SINO-US TRADE WILL BE DOUBLED.
IF BOTH SIDES FACILITATE TRADE, THIS POSSIBILITY EXISTS.
BEFORE NORMALIZATION, SINO-US TRADE GREW, THEN FELL.
AFTER NORMALIZATION, WE THINK TRADE WILL DEVELOP STEADILY -NOT FLUCTUATIONS LIKE A SNAKE -- BUT STEADY GROWTH.
JOINT EFFORTS ARE REQUIRED FOR HIS PURPOSE -- BOTH SIDES
GRANTING MFN -- AND THIS WILL BE BENEFICIAL FOR THE
EXPANSION OF TRADE. WE THINK THAT MFN TREATMENT IS BENEFICIAL FOR BOTH SIDES.
KATZ: SECOND, WITH RESPECT TO STATISTICS, DO YOU ENVISION
THAT THERE MIGHT BE PUBLISHED STATISTICS ON A REGULAR BASIS
IN THE NEAR FUTURE?
WANG: OUR STATISTICAL DEPARTMENT IS STUDYING THIS PROPOSAL.
EVEN IF WE HAVE NO STATISTICS AVAILABLE, HOWEVER, WE CAN
EXCHANGE VIEWS ON THE SITUATION IN ORDER TO PROMOTE MUTUAL
UNDERSTANDING. AS TO THE QUESTION OF WHETHER OR NOT TO
PUBLISH STATISTICS,THIS IS HANDLED BY ANOTHER DEPARTMENT.
KATZ: I MIGHT SAY, WITH THE KIND OF OPEN TRADING RELATIONSHIP WE HOPE TO DEVELOP, IT IS IMPORTANT THAT GENERAL
INTERNATIONAL PRACTICES BE FOLLOWED. IT IS USEFUL FOR
BUSINESS AND GOVERNMENT TO GET A PICTURE OF WHAT THE TRADE
OPPORTUNITIES MIGHT BE. THERE WAS A DISCUSSION OF IMF
MEMBERSHIP, FOR EXAMPLE. THE IMF USUALY PUBLISHES
STATISTICS OF MEMBER COUNTRIES. IT WOULD BE USEFUL IF
WE COULD LOOK FORWARD TO THIS POSSIBILIITY FOR CHINA.
WANG: WE WISH TO ENGAGE IN MORE INTERNATIONAL ACTIVITY.
CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL
PAGE 04

BEIJIN 01333 07 OF 09 100841Z

AS FOR STATISTICS, WE CAN WORK ON IT AND CONSIDER HOW TO
PUBLISH THEM. IN THE PAST WE PUBLISHED STATISTICS. BUT
IN THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS, SUCH WORK STOOD STILL. WE
WOULD NOW LIKE TO RESUME NORMAL WORK. FOR EXAMPLE, PUBLISHING
CUSTOMS STATISTICS CAN BE CONSIDERED NORMAL. WE
SHOULD OFFER THEM TO YOU-- WE DO NOT HAVE THEM AVAILABLE.
WE ARE CONSDERING HOW TO RESUME THIS. PERHAPS YOU
NOTICED IN THE PEOPLE'S DAILY, THE STANDING COMMITTEE
OF THE NPC IS NOW CONSIDERING HOW TO FORMULATE A WIDE RANGE
OF LAWS. WE WISH TO NORMALIZE THESE THINGS, BUT IT
TAKES TIME.
KATZ: THIRD, THE OTHER QUESTION IS WITH RESPECT TO OUR
BILATERAL TRADE. IS THERE ANY GENERAL ESTIMATE YOU COULD
PUT ON THIS FOR THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS, POSSIBLY TO PUT
A DOLLAR FIGURE ON THIS?
WANG: DO YOU KNOW WHAT TOTAL TRADE WAS LAST YEAR?
LINCOLN: $1.14 BILLION, TWO-WAY.
WANG:(AFTER CONSULTING WITH HIS CHINESE COLLEAGUES)
ACCORDING TO OUR STATISTICS, IT WAS ABOUT $1 BILLION. THAT
IS VERY CLOSE. VICE PREMIER DENG STATED THAT HE EXPECTED
US-PRC TRADE TO INCREASE BY SEVERAL-FOLD. ACCORDING TO OUR

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
ESTIMATE, THIS YEAR'S FIGURE WILL BE MUCH BIGGER THAN LAST
YEAR.
KATZ: DO YOU HAVE A FIGURE?
WANG: IT DEPENDS ON THE CONCLUSION OF CONTRACTS; WE
EXPECT A BIGGER FIGURE THIS YEAR. WHAT IS YOUR VIEW?
KATZ: IT IS DIFFICULT FOR USTO KNOW. OUR TRADING SYSTEM
IS MADE UP OF MANY FIRMS. IT IS DIFFICULT TO PUT TOGETHER
A CLEAR PICTURE.

WANG: WE ALSO HAVE THE SAME SITUATION. IT DEPENDS ON
BUSINESS NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN OUR INDUSTRIAL DEPARTMENTS
AND THE US COUNTERPARTS. FOR SOME HIGH TECHNOLOGY
PRODUCTS, WE THOUGHT THE US PRODUCTS ARE VERY GOOD. BUT
FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS, THE AMERICAN EXPORTERS THINK THEY
CAN NOT GET THE SUPPORT OF THE AMERICAN GOVERNMENT. THEY
THINK IF THEY SIGN A CONTRACT, THEY WILL NOT BE ABLE TO
HONOR IT. SO OUR DESIRE CAN NOT BE FULFILLED.
KATZ: IT WOULD BE HELPFUL IN THAT REGARD, IF THERE ARE
PARTICULAR KINDS OF PRODUCTS, IF YOU COULD TELL US, E
MIGHT BE ABLE TO GIVE SOME ADVICE AND THERE ARE CERTAIN
PROBLEMS WHICH WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO RESOLVE. WE WOULD
LIKE TO BE HELPFUL IN THAT REGARD.
WANG: NOW, OUR INDUSTRIAL DEPARTMENTS ARE EXCHANGING VIEWS
WITH THEIR COUNTERPARTS IN THE US. VICE PREMIER YU QIULI
EXCHANGED VIEWS WITH TREASURY SECRETARY BLUMENTHAL ON THE
MAJOR ITEMS WE WISH TO IMPORT. RECENTLY, OIL EXPLORATION
AND PRODUCTION IS A VERY ACTIVE AREA; ALSO CHEMICAL PLANTS AND
EQUIPMENT; WE WISH TO MAKE FULL USE OF OUR WATER RESOURCES,

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
SO WE NEED HYDROPOWER EQUIPMENT; WE CAN ECHANGE VIEWS ON
COOPERATION IN THE METALLURGICAL INDUSTRIES. WE ARE ALSO
INTERESTED IN PRECISION INSTRUMENTS CONNECTED WITH
CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL
PAGE 02

BEIJIN 01333 08 OF 09 100914Z

ELECTRONICS AND COMPUTERIZED SYSTEMS.
KATZ: ON THE POINT YOU MENTIONED A MOMENT AGO REGARDING
THE UNCERTAINTIES OF FIRMS ONTHAT THEY CAN EXPORT, AS YOU
KNOW WE HAVE EXPORT CONTROL ON CERTAIN TYPES OF GOODS.
WANG: IF YOU DID NOT EXPORT THESE SAME COMMODITIES TO
OTHER COUNTRIES, WE WOULD HAVE NO COMPLAINTS, BECAUSE
THIS WOULD BE EQUAL TREATMENT.
KATZ: IT IS SOMETIMES NOT THAT CLEAR. IT IS NOT ALWAYS A
QUESTION OF THE COUNTRY TO WHICH A PRODUCT IS BEING
EXPORTED, BUT THE PURPOSE OF THE USE OF THE GOODS.
FREQUENTLY IT ISA QUESTION OF ASSURING OURSELVES THAT
THE PROPOSED USE OF THE GOODSWOULD NOT MAKE PROBLEMS
FOR US. MR. MARCUSS RECENTLY MET WITH YOUR LIAISON OFFICE
IN WASHINGTON TO INFORM THEM OF CERTAIN FORMAL REQUIREMENTS
WE HAVE FOR EXPORTS. THESE ARE REQUIREMENTS ATHAT ARE
REALLY IMPOSED ON ALL COUNTRIES. MR. MARCUSS' VISIT WAS
REALLY AN EFFORT TO FACILITATE XPORT LICENSING, AND IN
THAT SENSE I MADE THEPOINT A MOMENT AGO -- IF WE KNOW
OF A PARTICULAR INTEREST, WE CAN GIVE ADVICE ON HOW TO
AVOID PROBLEMS. THE OFFICE OFEXPORT ADMINISTRATION
IN THE DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE CAN BE A POINT OF CONTACT
FOR YOUR NEW EMBASSY. OF COURSE, MOST BUSINESSMEN KNOW
HOW TO GET ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS, BUT FREQUENTLY THE ANSWER
DEPENDS ON THE USE OF THE PRODUCT AND THAT INFORMATION WE
MUST GET FROM YOU. I THINK IF WE DEVELOP RELATIONS,
PROCEDUREES AND CONFIDENCE -- I THINK THE PROBLEMS IN
THIS AREA WILL BE VERY FEW.
WANG: WE HOPEYOU UNDERSTAND THE PRINCIPLE THAT THE MORE
WE EXPORT TO THE US, THE MORETRADE WILL DEVELOP. WE THINK
IT IS A NATURAL TENDENCY THAT CHINA WISHES TO DEVELOP ITS
NATIONAL ECONOMY AND CHANGE ITS BACKWARD STATUS. IF
CHINA IS MORE FLOURISHINGAND POWERFUL, IT WILL HAVE A
GREATER ABILITY FOR EXPORTING, AND MORE IMPORTS WILL FOLLOW.
CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL
PAGE 03

BEIJIN 01333 08 OF 09 100914Z

IN NO WAY WILL THIS AFFECT THE NATIONAL SECURITY OF THE US.
WE MUST JUDGE THIS MATEER FROM THE ANGLE OF PRINCIPLE. WE
KNOW YOU HAVE REGULATIONS AND RULES GOVERNING YOUR EXPORTS.
W THINK WE CANCONSULT IN THESE MTTERS. WE THINK THAT
THE US ADMINISTRATION WILL FACILITATE THIS.
KATZ: WE HAVE PRINCIPLES AND POLICIES WHICH IN SOME CASES

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
MAY BE DIFFERENT. OUR TASK IS TO FIND THE MUTUAL INTEREST.
OUR TASK IS TO TRY TO MEET THE LARGER OBJECTIVE OF DEVELOPING TRADE RELATIONS IN THE CONTEXT OF DIFFERING ECONOMIC
SYSTEMSAND IN SOME CASES DIFFERING POLITICAL OBJECTIVES.
BUT WE ARE CONFIDENT THAT WE CAN BRIDGE THESE DIFFICULTIES
IF WE APPROACH THE PROBLEMS IN A PRACTICAL MANNER. OUR
FIRST TASK IS TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THE PRINCIPLES, POLICIES,
LAWS, AND REGULATIONS ARE.
WANG: WE AGREE WITH YOUR OPINION. WE THINK
WE MUST JUDGE THEMATTER FROM THEWHOLE PERSPECTIVE -- TOTAL TRADE
RELATIONS BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES AND THE HARMFUL EFFECTS
OF YOUR EXPORT CONTROLS. ALTOUGH OUR SYSTEMS ARE DIFFERENT,
WE HAVE A COMMON DESIE TO DEVELOP TRADE. IT IS A COMMON
GROUND. WE THINK BOTH COUNTRIES HAVE SIMILAR OUTLOOKS IN
INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS. WHEN WE DEAL WITH SPECIFIC PROBLEMS,
WE MUST TTAKE ALL FACTORS INTO ACCOUNT BECAUSE THEY ARE
CONNECTED WITH THE GENERAL PRINCIPLES. AS FOR US OFFICIALS,
YOU HAVE A POLICY THAT YOU MUST TREAT CHINA AND THE SOVIET
UNION EQUALLY. WE UNDERSTAND THAT YOU HAVE THIS POSITION.
BUT WHEN YOUDEAL ON SPECIFIC MATTERS, YOU CAN NOT TREAT
THESEE MATERS EQUALLY.
KATZ: OUR POLICY IS NOT TO TREAT ONLY THE USSR AND CHINA EQUALLY
BUT TO TREAT ALL COUNTRIES EQUALLY.IN ONE WAY, OUR EXPORT
CONTROLS DO NOT DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN THE USSR OR BRAZIL
OR FRANCE. THIS DOES NOT MEAN THAT WE APPROVE SPECIFIC
EQUIPMENT FOR ONE COUNTRY OR ANOTHER, BUT THAT THE POLICY
IS CONSISTENT. THE JUDGMENTSWE MAKE ARE THE SAME FOR
EACH COUNTRY ALTHOUGH THE DECISIONS MAY BE DIFFERENT.
WANG: WE HOPE YOU HAVE FEXIBILITY.

KATZ: WE DO, AND LET ME EMPHASIZE OUR OBJECTIVE IS TO
PUT THE EMPHASIS ON THE POSITIVE NOT THE NEGATIVE. WE
WANT VERY MUCH TO DEVELOP TRADE WITH CHINA; WE MUST WORK
WITHIN THE OTHER POLICIES WE MAY ENCOUNTER, BUT OUR
OBJECTIVE IS TO OVERCOME THE PROBLEMS AND EXPAND TRADE.
WANG: WE HOPE THE SITUATION WILL IMPROVE IN THE TIMES
AHEAD. WE ARE GOING TO SET UP A JOINT ECONOMIC COMMITTEE.
THIS COMMITTEE CAN DISCUSS MAJOR ITEMS.
KATZ: I THINK THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT. MANY OF THE PROBLEMS
WE HAVE OR APPEAR TOHAVE CAN EASILY BE RESOLVED THROUGH
DISCUSSIONS. IF WE BUILD A PRACTICE OF REGULAR CONSULTATION,
WE CAN DECREASE THE NUMBER OF PROBLEMS ENCOUNTERED AND THE
MAGNITUDE OF THE PROBLEMS. I THINK YOU WILL FIND THAT ALL
PARTS OF OUR GOVERNMENT WILL BE VERY OPEN TO DISCUSSIONS
WITH YOU. THE PURPOSE OF THE JOINT COMMITTEE WILL BE TO
FIND SOME FOCUS TO THE OVERALL RELATIONS AND ALSO TO PROVIDE A PLACE TO RESOLVE PROBLEMS WHICH CAN NOT BE RESOLVED
THROUGH NORMAL CHANNELS.

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
WANG: WE THINK THAT THE JOINT COMMITTEE WILL PROVIDE A
FOCAL POINT AND ALSO ENABLE USETO RESOLVE MINOR PROBLEMS.
I THINK THERE STILL EXISTS SOME PROBLEMS ON THE AMERICAN
SIDE. WE HOPE THE US ADMINISTRATION WILL MAKE EFFORTS TO
RESOLVE THESE PROBLEMS. INTERMS OF OUR EXPORTS TO THE
US, WE HOPE THE US GOVERNMENT WILL MAKE EFFORTS TO BRING
ABOUT THE EXPANSION OF TRADE IN THIS DIRECTON. IN THE
PREVIOUS TRADE, WE HAD AN UNFAVORABLE BALANCE. IN THE
PRESENT SITUATION, WE DO NOT REJECT THE POSSIBILITY OF TRADE
IMBALANCES.
BUT WE THINK IT IS NECESSARY FOR BOTH SIDES TO DIMINISH
THE IMBALANCES-- JOINT EFFORTS ARE REQUIRED. WE HOPE

KATZ:I THINK WE SHOULD SPEND A FEW MINUTES ON TEXTILES.
AS SECRETARY BLUMENTHAL SAID YESTERDAY TO MINISTER LI,
THIS IS A VERY DIFFICULT PROBLEM -- A WORLD WIDE PROBLEM.
I THINK YOU KNOW FROM YOUR RELATIONS WITH OTHER COUNTRIES
THAT THIS IS A PROBLEM WITH OTHER COUNTIES, AS WELL.
IN EUROPE, THEY HAVE PUT AN ABSOLUTE QUOTA ON THEIR
TEXTILE IMPORTS. MANY COUNTRIES HAVE EMBARGOES ON
TEXTILE IMPORTS. WE DO NOT DO THAT. OUR POLICY IS
RESTRICTIVE, BUT NOT A S RESTRICTIVE AS OTHER COUNTRIES
AND WE HAVE PERMITTED IMPORTS TO INCREASE TO THE US.
AS SECRETARY BLUMENTHAL SAID, WE ARE A BIG MARKET BUT NOT
AN UNLIMITED MARKET.THE TEXTILE AND APPAREL INDUSTRIES
MUST BE LOOKED AT TOGETHER. IT IS A LARGE INDUSTRY IN
THE US. THE TWO INDUSTRIES EMPLOY A LOT OF WORKERS. IT
IS A PRBLEM OF POLITICAL SENSITIVITY IN THE US AS WELL AS IN OTHER
COUNTRIES -- HOW THE IMPORTS WILL AFFECT THE EMPLOYMENT OF
WORKERS IN THESE INDUSTRIES. WE RECOGNIZE THAT TEXTILES
ARE A NATURAL EXPORT FOR CHINA. IN FACT, YOU HAVE COME
FROM ZERO TO SIXTH PLACE IN OUR MARKET. THAT IS, YOU ARE
NUMBER SIX IN EXPORTS TO OUR MARKET. WHAT WE NEED IS AN
UNDERSTANDING AND AGREEMENT THAT WILL PERMIT YOUR EXPORTS
TO INCREASE AT AA REASONABLE RATE. IT WOULD BE DESIRABLE
IF YOUR EXPORTS WERE NOT CONCENTRATED IN PARTICULAR PRODUCTS. SO W HAVE MADE SUGGESTIONS FOR THE MEANS FOR YOUR
EXPORTS TO CONTINUE TO INCREASE WITHOUT CREATING PROBLEMS
FOR OUR MARKET. I WON'T GO INTOTHE DETWILS OF THE
NEGOTIATIONS AND THE PROPOSALS. I AM NOT REALLY EQUIPPED
TO DO SO.A FURTHER MEETING WILL BE HELD BETWEEN THE TWO
SIDES IN MARCH. WE THINK I IS VERY IMPORTANT THAT A
SOLUTION BE FOUND AT THE NEXT MEETING. IF NO SOLUTION IS
FOUND, ONE WILL BE IMPOSED ON YOU -- AND ON US. WE WILL BE
FORCED TO TAKE UNILATERAL ACTION. IN THE LAST CONGRESS, OVER HALF
THE MEMBERS SUPPORTED A BILL TO AKE UNILATERAL ACTION TO

THE MTN NEGOTIATIONS IN GENEVA. THE PRESIDENTDID NOT

REALITY, WE CAN NOT IGNORE THEPOLITICAL FORCES IN OUR
COUNTRY. IF WE CAN NOT FINDAA MUTUALLY AGREEABLE SOLUTION,
WE WILL BEFORCED TO TAKE UNILATERAL ACTION -- WHICH WE
DON'T WANT TO DO.
WANG: I AGREE THAT WE SHOULD NOT GO INTO THIS PROBLEM
IN TOO MUCH DETAIL, BUT I WANT TO DISCUSS THE PRINCIPLE.
FIRST, WE EXPORT EXTILES NOT ONLY TO THE US BUT TO MANY
OTHER CONTRIES. SECOND, OUR CAPACITY TO EXPORT TEXTILES
IS LIMITED. THIRD, WE HOPE WE CAN EXERT OUR JOINT EFFORTS
TO FIND A REASONABLE SOLUTION. WE THINK IF YOU GIE US
AN UNFAIR QUOTA -- TAKE UNILATERAL ACTION -- THIS MEANS
YOU CREATED A PRETEXT FOR YOUR UNILATERAL ACTON. WE THINK
THAT IF YOU GIVE US A REAONSABLE AND FAIR QUOTA, WE CAN
FIND A SOLUTION. I WISH TO EPEAT, IF YOU GIVE US AN
UNREASONABLE QUOTA WHICH WE WOULD BE COMPELLED NOT TO
ACCEPT, AND YOU TOOK UNILAERAL ACTION, THIS MEANS THAT
YOU CREATED THE PRETEXT FOR YOUR ATION. WE THINK THIS
CAN BE RESOLVED. WE HOPE WE CAN RESOLVE THIS AT THE NEXT
MEETING. IT IS VERY IMPORTANT.
KATZ: THE ONLY OTHER POINT -- WE TALKED YESTERDAY ABOUT
A MEMORANDUM OF RECORD.WE DID PREPARE SOMETHING LAST
NIGHT, BUT IT NEEDS TO BE AMENDED TO REFLECT THE DISCUSSIONS
THS MORNING. UNFORTUATELY, WE DO NOT HAVE A CLEAN COPY
TO GIVE YOU; THIS ONE IS MARKED UP. LET ME READ THIS TO
YOU AND THEN GIVE YOU A CLEAN COPY LATER. (MR. KATZ
READ THE DRAFT MEMORANDUM OF RECORD.)
WANG: ACCORDING TO OUR PRACTICES, WE HAVE NO PRACTICE OF
PREPARING SUCH A MEMORANDUM OF RECORD. BUT IN ACCORDNCE
WITH YOUR REQUEST, WE CAN WORK OUT SUCH A MEMORANDUM.
PERHAPS WE CAN SAY: &quot;BOTH SIDES HAVE EXCHANGED VIEWS ON
THE CONTENT OF A TRADEAGREEMENT.FOR SOME PROVISIONS,
BOTH SIDES EXPRESSED THEIR RESPECTIVE VIEWS. FOR SOME

PROVISIONS, THERE NEED TO BE FURTHER EXPLORATORY TALKS.&quot;
FOR EXAMPLE, YESTERDAY, WE SPENT A LOT OF TIME DISCUSSING
WHAT YOU CALL &quot;NATIONAL SECURITY&quot;. PERHAPS YOU CAN AMEND
THIS AND GIVE US A CLEAN COPY.
YOU HAVE DONE MORE WORK THAN WE HAVE (ON THE
MEMORANDUM).
KATZ:THAT'S WHY WE'RE HERE. LET ME REITERATE THAT OUR
PURPOSE IS NOT TO COMMIT YOU TO A PARTICULAR VIEW BUT ONLY
TO SET DOWN OUR UNDERSTANDING ON THESE MATTERS FOR THE
RECORD.
WANG: TO REFLECT THE TRUE PICTURE. IN PRINCIPLE WE AGRE,
BUT PERHAPS SOME ADJUSTMENTS IN THE WORDING ARE NEEDED.
KATZ: THANK YOU. I HAVE NO FURTHER ITEMS ON MY SIDE.
I WOULD BE GLAD TO CONSIDER ANY YOU WOULD LIKE TO RAISE.

WANG: NO, I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING MORE, BUT BOTH SIDES TOOK
A POSITIVE ATTITUDE; BOTH SIDES EXPRESSED THEIR OWN VIEWS.
WE RESPECT YOUR NORMAL PRACTICES AND REULES AND REGULATIONS.
WE HOPE YOU ALSO RESPECT OURS. WE THINK BOTH SIDES HAVE
SOLVED MAJOR ITEMS. SO IT IS EASIER TO RESOLVE THE MINOR
TINGS. WE THINK A TRADE AGREEMENT MUST RESPECT EACH OTHER'S
DESIRES. I GREATLY APPRECIAE THE KIND OF COOPERATION YOU
EXTENDED TO US. DIRECTOR ZHANG, DIVISION CHIEF, WILL HAVE
FURTHER CONTACT WITH YOU ON THE MEMORANDUM OF RECORD.
KATZ: LET ME SAY, I THINK WE HAD TWO DAYS OF PRODUCTIVE
MEETINGS. I FEEL OUR SIDE WE HAVE CCOMPLISHED OUR
MMISSION -- TO LAY THE FOUNDATION FOR NEGOTIAION OF A
TRADE AGREEMENT. WE HAVE CLARIFIED A NUMBER OF MATTERS.
THERE ARE SOME ISSUES FOR WHICH WE NEED TO DO FURTHER
WORK, BUT I FEEL CONFIDENT THAT THE OBJECTIVE OF BOTH
SIDES IS THAT WE CAN RESOLVE THES PROBLEMS VERY QUICKLY.
WE WILL PROVIDE A CLEAN COPY OF THE MEMORANDUM VERY SOON.

RAISED WITH MR. SUN SOME SUBJECTS YESTERDAY.

BETWEEN OUR TWO COUNTRIES, INCLUDING TRADE RELATIONS. I
THINK ALL THESE TALKS HAVE RESOLVED THE PRINCIPLES FOR OUR
TALKS. THUS THE TALKS HAVE ALREADY PASSED THE HALFWAY POINT.
WE THINK OUR WORK IS NOW EASY. (AT THIS POINT VICE MINISTER
WANG INTRODUCED THE CHINESE PARTICIPANTS AND ASSISTANT
SECRETARY KATZ INTRODUCED THE US SIDE)
WANG: USLO HAS HANDED OVER A LIST OF SUBJECTS TO BE CONTAINED
IN THE TRADE AGREEMENT WHICH YOU WISH TO DISCUSS WITH US.
YOU HAD AN EXCHANGE OF VIEWS WITH MR. SUN. SO NOW WE WOULD
LIKE TO LISTEN TO YOUR VIEWS ON THESE ISSUES.
KATZ: THANK YOU. AS SECRETARY BLUMENTHAL SAID THIS MORNING,
OUR PURPOSE IS TO LAY A FOUNDATION ON WHICH WE CAN BUILD
A FAST GROWING TRADE RELATIONSHIP. A TRADE AGREEMENT IS
AN ESSENTIAL ELEMENT IN THIS FOUNDATION. UNDER OUR LAWS,
IT IS NECESSARY THAT MOST FAVORED NATION (MFN) TREATMENT
BE PROVIDED IN THE FRAMEWORK OF A TRADE AGREEMENT. OUR LAWS,
MOREOVER, SPECIFY CERTAIN ELEMENTS WHICH MUST BE PART OF
THAT TRADE AGREEMENT. WHAT WE HOPE TO DO THIS WEEK IS TO
INTRODUCE OUR REQUIREMENTS, EXPLAIN WHAT WE HAVE IN MIND,
EXCHANGE VIEWS, AND PLAN HOW WE SHOULD PROCEED -- LOOKING
FORWARD TO THE CONCLUSION OF A TRADE AGREEMENT. I CONVEYED
TO MR. SUN NINE POINTS WHICH WE BELIEVE ARE REQUIRED OR

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
RELEVANT FOR INCLUSION IN A TRADE AGREEMENT. IF YOU AGREE
THAT THIS CAN FORM THE AGENDA FOR OUR WORK, I WOULD PROPOSE
TO START WITH THE FIRST OF THESE ITEMS, AND THEN DISCUSS THE REST.
DISCUSSIONS CAN BE CONTINUED TOMORROW IF ECESSARY.
WANG: AGREED.
KATZ: THE FIRST ITEM CALLS FOR MUTUAL ASSISTANCE WITH
RESPECT TO TRADE OPPORTUNITIES AND NON-DISCRIMINATORY
TREATMENT INCLUDING MFN AND RECIPROCAL TRADE OPPORTUNITIES.
THE ITEM WE ARE DISCUSSING DEALS WITH THE ROVISION OF MFN
TREATMENT. OUR SIDE, THIS PROVISION IS VERY SIMPLE-ESSENTIALLY, IT IS A STANDARD MFN PROVISION FOUND IN MOST
TRADE AGREEMENTS. WE, OF COURSE, HAVE A TWO-COLUMN
TARIFF SYSTEM, AS YOU MAY KNOW -- ONE COLUMN APPLIES TO MFN;
THE OTHER COLUMN HAS TO DO WITH STATUTORY RATES, WHICH ARE
CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL
PAGE 04

BEIJIN 01333 01 OF 09 100623Z

CONSIDERABLY HIGHER. WE HAVE A REQUIREMENT THAT MFN TREATMENT BE RECIPROCATED ON YOU SIDE BY SOME PROVISIONS TO
ASSURE THAT THEERE ARE EQUIVALENT AND RECIPROCAL TRADE
OPPORTUNITIES IN YOUR MARKET.
FRANKLY SPEAKING, WE DO NOT KNOW MUCH ABOUT YOUR
TARIFF SITUATION. WE UNDERSTAND YOU HAVE A TARRIFF SYSTEM,
BUT WE DO NOT KNOW HOW IT OPERATES. THERE ARE VARIOUS
WAYS WE COULD PROVIDE FOR RECIPROCITY, AS WE HAVE WITH
OTHER COUNTRIES. SOME OF THE RECIPROCITY COULD BE PROVIDED
IN OTHER PROVISIONS IN THE TRADE AGREEMENT, SUCH AS TOSE
COVERING BUSINESS FACILITATION, BUT WE THINK THAT THERE COULD BE
OTHER PROVISIONS DEALING WITH THIS MATTER. FOR EXAMPLE,
THERE COULD BE A DECISION THAT CHINA WILL BASE ITS PURCHASES
FROM THE UNITED STATES SOLELY ON COMMERCIAL TERMS, THAT IS,
PRICE, QUALITY, DELIVERY, AND CREDIT TERMS. WE ALSO WANT
SOME PROVISION THAT THERE WILL BE NO DISCRIMINATION AGAINST
THE US, EITHER BY CHINESE ENTERPRISE OR THE CHINESE
GOVERNMENT -- WHOEVER MAKES IMPORTANT DECISIONS. THAT'S ALL I
WANT TO SAY ABOUT THIS ITEM -- PERHAPS YOU WANT TO COMMENT?
WANG: WE SHARE YOUR VIEWS. SIGNING OF A TRADE AGREEMENT
SHOULD HELP TO DEVELOP TRADE. GRANTING MFN TREATMENT TO

EACH OTHER IS A VERY IMPORTANT ELEMENT. MFN TREATMENT IS
RELATED TO TARIFFS -- WHICH ARE VERY IMPORTANT IN TRADE.
SO WE THINK THE TRADE AGREEMENT MUST EMBODY FACILITATION
FOR TRADE; EMBODY MFN TREATMENT. WE AGREE TO HAVE SUCH
PROVISIONS -- MFN TREATMENT -- IN OUR TRADE AGREEMENT.
WE HAVE IN CHINA TWO TYPES OF TARIFFS -- GENERAL
TARIFFS AND LOW TARIFFS (MFN TARIFFS). THIS IS THE SAME
AS YOUR SYSTEM. FOR OUR PART, THERE IS NO DIFFICULTY TO
STIPULATE N MFN TREATMENT CLAUSE IN THE TRADE AGREEMENT.
AS FOR EXCEPTIONAL CLAUSES IN ADDITION TO MFN TREATMENT,
WE WOULD LIKE TO LISTEN TO YOUR VIEWS. I WOULD LKKE TO
TAKE THIS IOPPORTUNITY TO MAKE ANOTHER POINT, NOT CONNECTED
WITH MFN, BUT ALSO A &quot;FAVORED ITEM.&quot; CHINA SHOULD ENJOY
BENEFICIARY STATUS UNDER GSP FOR DEVELOPING COUNTRIES.
WE HOPE THIS CLAUSE WILL BE INCLUDED IN THE TRADE AGREEMENT.
WE WOULD LIKE TO LISTEN TO YOUR VIEWS ON HOW TO PUT THIS
IN THE TRADE AGREEMENT.

KATZ: LET ME SAY FIRST, WITH RESPECT TO YOUR TARIFFS, AS
WE UNDERSTAND IT, THE CHINESE TARIFF SYSTEM IS NOT A
REGULATOR OF TRADE AS IT IS IN A MARKET ECONOMY SUCH AS
OURS -- ALTHOUGH WE WOULD BE GLAD TO LISTEN TO AN EXPLANATION
OF YOUR TARIFF SYSTEM.
WANG: OUR TARIFF SYSTEM HAS TWO COLUMNS -- GENERAL AND LOW
TARIFFS. THE LOW TARIFFS ARE THE MFN TARIFFS. THIS IN
ITSELF IS AN ASSURANCE FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF TRADE -IT IS BENEFICIAL TO YOUR EXPORTS TO CHINA.
KATZ: DOES AN ENTERPRISE FACED WITH A DECISION ON IMPORT-

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
ING FROM TWO DIFFERENT SOURCES -- DOES THE TARIFF AFFECT
THE DECISION?
WANG: YES. OF COURSE, IT VARIES FROM ONE CASE TO ANOTHER.
WE HAVE MFN AND NON-MFN TARIFFS -- THE TWO RATES DIFFER.
KATZ: DO YOU HAVE THE RATES?
WANG: YES, WE HAVE, BUT NOT IN ENGLISH.
KATZ: PERHAPS THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL.
WANG: YES, WE CAN GIVE THEM TO YOU.
KATZ: I ASSUME YOU ARE WILLING TO CONSIDER THE LANGUAGE
WE WISH TO PROPOSE?
WANG: YES.
KATZ: I SHOULD HAVE STATED AT THE OUTSET THE OBVIOUS -THERE IS A WELL-KNOWN ISSUE RELATING TO MFN EXTENSION
WHICH SECRETARY BLUMENTHAL REFERRED TO THIS MORNING. INDEED
IT WAS DISCUSSED WITH VICE PREMIER DENG XIAOPING BY
PRESIDENT CARTER WHEN HE WAS IN WASHINGTON, DC. AS
SECRETARY BLUMENTHAL RESTATED THIS MORNING, IT IS OUR DESIRE
TO ACCORD CHINESE EXPORTS MFN BECAUSE WE UNDERSTAND IT
IS THE NECESSARY BASIS FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF TRADE. WE
ARE WORKING WITH CONGRESS TO FIND A WAY TO DEAL WITH THIS
LEGAL PROBLEM. SO WE ARE PROCEEDING IN THIS WORKING GROUP
ON THE ASSUMPTION THAT A WAY WILL BE FOUND AROUND THE LEGAL
PROBLEM DURING THE COURSE OF THE YEAR. WE CAN DISCUSS THE
CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL
PAGE 03

BEIJIN 01333 02 OF 09 100649Z

REQUIREMENTS OF A TRADE AGREEMENT, BUT WE ARE NOT DEALING
WITH THE LEGAL PROBLEM IN THIS WORKING GROUP.
WITH RESPECT TO THE QUESTION OF GSP WHICH YOU RAISED,
UNDER OUR LAW THERE ARE SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS FOR ELIGIBILITY
FOR GSP. I ASSUME THESE ARE FAMILIAR TO YOU. ONE REQUIREMENT HAS TO DO WITH MFN -- THE COUNTRY MUST RECEIVE MFN
IN ORDER TO RECEIVE GSP. SECOND, THE COUNTRY MUST BE A
MEMBER OF IMF AND GATT. THIRD, THE COUNTRY MUST NOT BE
DOMINATED OR CONTROLLED BY INTERNATIONAL COMMUNISM. THAT
LATTER IS A HISTORICAL REFERENCE IN A SENSE, INTENDED
REALLY TO MAKE TWO COUNTRIES ELIGIBLE -- POLAND AND YUGOSLAVIA.
AS A PRACTICAL MATTER, IN THE NEAR TERM, IMF AND GATT MEMBERSHIP ARE THE IMMEDIATE PROBLEMS. I WOULD NOT ENCOURAGE YOU
TO EXPECT THAT GSP WOULD BE AVAILABLE IN THE NEAR FUTURE. I
THINK AS A PRACTICAL MATTER -- IN TERMS OF OUR WORK -- WE SHOULD
THINK IN TERMS OF THE OTHER ELEMENTS WHICH WOULD BE INCLUDED
IN THE TRADE AGREEMENT.
WANG: ALL RIGHT. SINCE WE ARE A DEVELOPING COUNTRY, WE
THINK CHINA SHOULD BE ELIGIBLE TO ENJOY GSP TREATMENT -WE PUT THIS FORWARD FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION. IF THERE IS
NOTHING FURTHER TO DISCUSS ON THIS, WE CAN GO ON TO THE
NEXT TOPIC.

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
KATZ: VERY GOOD. THE NEXT SUBJECT IS TRADE FACILITATION.
WE HAD SOME DISCUSSION ON THIS THIS MORNING. I UNDERSTOOD
MINISTER LI JIANG TO SAY THAT HE FAVORED FACILITATIVE
ARRANGEMENTS FOR BUSINESSMEN. THERE ARE SEVERAL ASPECTS
WHICH I WOULD LIKE TO EXPLAIN. WE THINK THE TRADE AGREEMENT
SHOULD ESTABLISH PRINCIPLES FOR EQUITABLE PARTICIPATION
BY FIRMS AND ENTERPRISES OF BOTH COUNTRIES IN THE OTHER
COUNTRY WITH RESPECT TO A NUMBER OF SERVICES. THIS INCLUDES
TRANSPORTATION, INSURANCE, FINANCIAL MATTERS, TECHNICAL
ADVICE, ADVERTISING, AND OTHER THINGS. ALSO, TO PERMIT
TRADE RELATIONS TO FLOURISH, IT IS IMPORTANT TO HAVE AVAILCONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL
PAGE 04

BEIJIN 01333 02 OF 09 100649Z

ABLE INFORMATION CONCERNING LAWS, REGULATIONS, AND STATISTICS
WITH RESPECT TO EACH COUNTRY. THIS MORNING THERE WERE DISCUSSIONS CONCERNING THE ESTABLISHMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE
OFFICES IN EACH COUNTRY. WE BELIEVE THAT THE TRADE AGREMENT
SHOULD PROVIDE FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT OFSUCH OFFICES, INCLUDING PROVISIONS FOR OFFICE SPACE, IMPORTATION OF PERSONAL
EFFFECTS,AUTOMOBILES, ENTRY AND EXIT, HIRING AND COMPENSATION
OF LOCAL PERSONNEL, IMPORTATION OF SAMPLES, AND SO FORTH.
WE THINK THESE MTTERS SHOULD BE INCLUDED IN THE TRADE
AGREEMENT. BECAUSE THESE THINGS FACILITATE THE DEVELOPMENT
OF TRADE, WE BELIEVE WE SHOULD DEVOTE PARTICULAR ATTENTION
TO THIS QUESTION AND PERHAPS CONCLUDE AN INTERIM AGREEMENT
IN ADVANCE OF THIS TRADE AGREEMENT. IF WE CAN PROGRESS
RAPIDLY, THIS ISPERHAPS A MATTER THAT SECRETARY KREPS COULD
CONCLUDE DURING HER VISIT. THERE ARE TWO OTHER MATTERS
WHICH SHOULD BE COVERED IN THIS AREA. ONE IS GOVERNMENT
TRADE OFFICES (PREVIOUSLY I WAS TALKING ABOUT PRIVATE
ENTERPRISES). WE SHOULD MAKE PROVISIONS FOR GOVERNMENT
OFFICES. ESSENTIALLY, THESE OFFICES, IN BEIJING AND
WASHINGTON, DC, WOULD BE INTEGRAL PARTS OF OUR RESPECTIVE
EMBASSIES, ALTHOUGH THEY COULD BE LOCATED IN SEPARATE
PREMISES. THE COMMERCIAL OFFICERS OF THESE OFFICES WOULD
BE PART OF THE EMBASSY DIPLOMATIC STAFF WITH ALL THE STATUS
OF EMBASSY OFFICIALS -- THEY WOULD ENJOY DIPLOMATIC STATUS. AS TO
THE FUNCTIONS OF THESE OFFICES, WE WOULD PROPOSE (FOR THE US) THAT
THEY WOULD SUPPORT EXHIBITS OF US PRODUCTS AND OTHER KINDS
OF TRADE PROMOTION ACTIVITIES. THEY WOULD ASSIST BOTH
AMERICAN BUSINESSMEN AND CHINESE ORGANIZATIONS INTERESTED
IN SALES OR OTHER COMMERCIAL TRANSACTIONS -- BOTH IMPORTS
AND EXPORTS. ONE TING WE ARE PREPARED TO OFFER ON AN
EARLY BASIS IS SEMINARS WITH RESPECT TO PARTICULAR INDUSTRIES
OR PRODUCTS WHICH WOULD BE OF INTEREST TO YOUR ORGANIZATIONS.

PRINCIPLE OF AN AGREEMENT.WE THINK BOTH SIDES CAN SET UP
RESIDENT REPRESENTATIVES IN EACH OTHER'S COUNTRIES. WE
WILL SEND OURS TO WASHINGTON, DC AND YOURS TO BEIJING.
FOR OUR PART, HOWEVER, THERE EXIST TECHNICAL PROBLEMS. WE
LACK HOTEL ACCOMODATIONS. NEVERTHELESS, WE HAVE ALREADY
OFFEREED CONVENIENCES AND FACILITIES FOR AMERICAN BUSINESSMENT, FOR EXAMPLE, FOR SOME TECHNICIANS WHO HAVE STAYED IN
CHINA FOR A LONG TIME TO OFFER TECHNICAL SEMINARS. WE
EXTENED THEIR VISAS FROM TIME TO TIME AND OFFEREED THEM
FACILITIES. WE HAVE NO AGREEMENT, BUT WE CAN AGREE ON
THE AGREEMENT. AS FOR RESIDENT REPRESENTATIVES IN OTHER
CITIES IN CHINA, WE CAN STUDY THE PSSIBILITIES IN ACCORD
WITH OUR WORKING REQUIREMENTS. WE CAN OFFER FACILITIES
AND CONVENIENCES FOR ALL BUSINESSMEN IF REQUIRED. AS A
MATTER OF FACT, WE HAVE ALREADY OFFERED CONVENIENCES BENEFICIAL TO BOTH SIDES. YOUR USLO OFFICER IS VERY FAMILIAR
WITH THIS. FOR EXAMPLE, IN THE CASE OF CHEMICAL FERTILIZER
TECHNICIANS, WE ALLOWED THEM TO TRAVEL TO MANY PARTS OF

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
EMBASSIES WHICH ENJOY DIPLOMATIC STATUS. WE CAN OFFER
FACILITIES AND CONVENIENCES TO EITHER PRIVATE ENTERPRISES
OR OFFICIAL REPRESENTATIVES. AS A MATTER OF FACT, WE ARE
ALREADY DOING SO. WE THINK IT IS NECESSARY TO INCLUDE A
CLAUSE IN THE AGREEMENT AND WE ARE PREPARED TO PERMIT YOU TO
ESTABLISH
CONSULATES GENERAL WITH COMMERCIAL OFFICES IN OTHER PARTS
OF OUR COUNTRY. ACCORDING TO AMERICAN PRACTICE, WOULD
THESE CONSULATES GENERAL INCLUDE COMMERCIAL REPRESENTATIVES?
KATZ: YES.
WANG: WE WILL PROVIDE CONVENIENCES FOR BUSINESSMEN.
KATZ: I AM PLEASED WITH YOUR RESPONSE. BOTH GOVERNMENT
AND PRIVATE OFFICES ARE NECESSARY TO PROVIDE ASSISTANCE FOR
DOING BUSINESS. BUT GOVERNMENT OFFICES CAN BE BERY HELPFUL
TO YOU -- IN THE SERVICES THEY CAN PROVIDE TO YOU. AS WELL AS
TO PRIVATE BUSINESSMEN. I THINK YOU WOULD FIND, FOR EXAMPLE,
THAT OUR COMMERCIAL OFFICE IN BEIJING WOULD BE WELL EQUIPPED
WITH INFORMATION ABOUT ALL US BUSINESSES AND INDUSTRIES.
IF YOU WANTED INFORMATION ABOUT A SPECIFIC PRODUCT OR INDUSTRY,
YOU COULD GO THERE TO FIND CATALOGS.
WANG: YES, WE HOPE SO.
KATZ: THIS CAN BE A USEFUL POINT OF CONTACT IF YOU WANT TO
LEARN MORE ABOUT WHAT IS AVAILABLE IN THE US CONCERNING
A PARTICULAR FIRM OR INDUSTRY.
WANG: ALONG WITH THE ESTABLISHMENT OF COMMERCIAL REPRESENTATION,
THER WILL BE A LOT OF ROUTINE WORK. IF WE ESTABLISHED COMMERCIAL
REPRESENTATION IN THE US, WE WOULD WISH TO ENJOY SUITABLE
FACILITIES. THIS SHOULD BE RECIPROCAL. FOR OUR PART, THERE
IS NO DIFFICULTY.WE THINK IT IS NECESSARY TO HAVE TECHNICAL
SEMINARS TO PROMOTE MUTUAL UNDERSTANDING. THE CHINA COUNCIL
FOR THE PROMOTION OF INTERNATIONAL TRADE (CCPIT) IS IN CHARGE
OF THIS WORK. THE MINISTRY OF FOREIGN TRADE SUPPORTS SUCH

SEMINARS. REPRESENTATIVES FROM FACTORIES AND INDIVIDUAL
DEPARTMENTS HAVE ATTENDED SEMINARS SPONSORED BY AMERICAN FIRMS.
KATZ: THE NEXT SUBJECT HAS TO DO WITH FINANCIAL PROVISIONS.
WE THINK IT IS DESIRABLE TO COVER PROVISIONS CONCERNING PAYMENTS, REMITTANCE OF CURRENCY, RATES OF EXCHANGE, BANKING
RELATIONS, AND SIMILAR MATTERS. WE MIGHT ALSO HAVE PROVISIONS
FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT OF BRANCH BANKS OF EACH COUNTRY IN THE
OTHER COUNTRY. IN HIS MEETING YESTERDAY WITH THE MINISTER OF
FINANCE, SECRETARY BLUMENTHAL SAID HE HOPED TO SEE A SIGN
SAYING &quot;BANK OF CHINA&quot; ON WALL STREET. WITHOUT PLAYING FAVORITESN
WE HOPE TO SEE A SIGN SAYING &quot;BANKS OF AMERICA&quot; IN CHINA (BECAUSE
WE HAVE MORE THAN ONE COMMERCIAL BANK).
WANG: WE THINK THIS SUBJECT FALLS WITHIN THE AREA OF BANKING
BUSINESS; YOU SHOULD CONTACT THE BANK OF CHINA. MAYBE THE US
FRIENDS ARE AWARE THAT WE HAVE ESTABLISHED A BRANCH BANK IN
LONDON. VERY SOON. WE ARE PREPARING TO ESTABLISH A BRANCH
BANK IN LUXEMBOURG. WE THINK YOU MAY RECEIVE AN EXPLANATION

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
FROM THE BANK OF CHINA ABOUT THE BUSINESS
REQUIREMENTS. IF IT IS NECESSARY TO INCLUDE PROVISIONS
IN THE TRAE AGREEMENT, WE CAN STUDY THAT.
KATZ: THE WORKING GROUP ON BAKING PROBLEMS IS DISCUSSING
THIS SAME MATTER -- THERE IS NO NEED FOR US TO DISCUSS
THIS IN DETAIL.
WANG: YES.
KATZ: WE HAVE PROVISIONS LIKE THIS IN OTHER TRADE AGREEMENTS
AS YOU MAY BE AWARE. THEY ARE NOT VERY COMPLEX. WE WILL
GIVE YOU A COPY.
WANG: TO DEVELOP TRADE, WE NEED CREDIT. WE WONDER WHETHER
YOU CAN OFFER FACILITIES FOR PROVIDING CREDIT?
KATZ: WE THINK IT IS QUITE NORMAL TO PROVIDE FOR CREDIT
FACILITIES. WE UNDERSTAND THAT GIVEN YOUR STATE OF ECONOMIC
DEVELOPMENT AND TRADE DEVELOPMENT, CREDIT WOULD PLAY AN
IMPORTANT ROLE. INDEED, THERE WAS SOME DISCUSSION OF THIS
MATTER BETWEEN SECRETARY BLUMENTHAL AND THE MIISTER OF
FINANCE. AT THE MOMENT, THERE ARE SOME LEGAL PROBLEMS AND
CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL
PAGE 04

BEIJIN 01333 03 OF 09 100712Z

FINANCIAL OBSTACLES. WE ASSUME THAT IN TIME THESE WILL BE
OVERCOME. I SHOULD EMPHASIZE THAT WE ARE SPEAKING OF
OFFICIAL CREDITS, NOT PRIVATE CREDITS.
WANG: IF YOU REMOVE ALL THE OBSTACLES, THEN THERE WILL BE NO PROBLEM?
KATZ: THERE IS ONLY ONE REMINING PROBLEM -- MONEY*
(LAUGHTER)
WANG: YOU CAN OFFER CREDIT FACILITIES?
KATZ: WE CAN EXPECT THATAFTER THE PROBLEMS ARE RESOLVED,
WE CAN OFFER CREDIT FACILITIES. TO BE VERY CLEAR, I SHOULD
MAKE THREE POINTS. FIRST, THERE IS A LEGAL PROBLEM SIMILAR
TO MFN. I ASSUME THAT WHEN THE PROBLEM OF ONE IS RESOLVED
(MFN), THE OTHER WILL BE RESOLVED AT THE SAME TIME (CREDITS).
SECOND, RELATIONS NEED TO BE DEVELOPED WITH THE EXPORT
IMPORT BANK, WHICH IS OUR CREDIT AGENCY. IT IS A PART OF
THE US GOVERNMENT, BUT OPERATES INDEPENDENTLY UTILIZING
PRINCIPLES OF CREDIT WORTHINESS, AND SO FORTH. AND THERE
IS AN ISSUE OF OUTSTANDING DEBT WHICH NEEDS TO BE RESOLVED.
THIRS,AND THIS PURELY AN AMERICAN PROBLEM, IS TO FIND
THE MONEY. AT PRESENT, THE EXPORT IMPORT BANK IS LIMITED
IN ITS RESOURCES. IT HAS DEMANDS WHICH EXCEED ITS RESOURCES
(MONEY) BY THREE TIMES. WE THINK THIS IS A PROBLEM WHICH
CAN BE RESOLVED. IT REQUIRES SOME TIME AND THE RESOLUTION
OF THE EARLIER ISSUES I REFERRED TO.
KATZ: THE NEXT SUBJECT -- UNDER THE TRADE ACT OF 1974,
WE REQUIRE CERTAIN PROVISIONS WHICH ARE NECESSARY TO PROTECT
OUR MARKET FROM DISRUPTION OF IMPORTS. ESSENTIALLY, THESE
PROVISIONS REQUIRE THAT THERE BE BILATERAL CONSULTATIONS
IN AN EFFORT TO RESOLVE THE PROBLEM ON A MUTUALLY SATISFACTORY
BASIS. IF THE PROBLEM CAN NOT BE RESOLVED ON A MUTUALLY
SATISFACTORY BASIS, WE NEED THE RIGHT TO TAKE UNILATERAL

TEXTILE TRADE IS SO LARGE, EVERY COUNTRY HAS PROBLEMS WITH
TEXTILE IMPORTS SO THIS PROBLEMS IS TAKING ON MULTINATIONAL
OR INTERNATIONAL CHARACTERISTICS.THE OTHER CASES WILL NOT BE
AS LARGE. ONLY ONE CASE HAS BEEN BROUGHT UNDER THIS PROVISION,
AND NO ACTION WAS TAKEN. THE OBJECT IS TO PROVIDE A PROCEDURE
WHICH WILL DIMINISH PROBLEMS RATHRR THAN TO PERMIT THEM TO
BECOME WORSE. THE ESSENTIAL INGREDIENT IS TO FIND A MUTUAL
SOLUTION. RATHER THAN TO TAKE UNILATERAL ACTION.
WANG: WE THINK THIS IS A TWO-PART PROBLEM. ONE PART RELATES
TO THE LAWS IN FORCE, THE OTHER PART ISTHE ACTUAL PRACTICES.
WE HOPE THERE WILL NOT BE PROTECTION PROVISIONS IN THE TRADE
AGREEMENT. IF YOU INSIST, WE WILL CONSIDER HOW TO DEVELOP
APPROPRIATE WORDING FOR SUCH A PROVISION IN THE AGREEMENT
WE THINK THAT, IN ORDER TO DEVELOP TRADE, WE CAN SOLVE PROBLEMS
THROUGH MUTUAL CONSULTATION. WE HOPE YOU WILL NOT OVERESTIMATE
OUR ABILITY. AS FOR THE TIEMS YOU THOUGHT SENSITIVE, FOR

EXAMPLE, TEXTILES, WE HAVE ONLY A LIMITED QUANITYT FOR
EXPORT. WE HOPE YOU WILL OFFER US A REASONABLE QUOTAM.
CONSUMER GOODS ARE THE MAIN ITEMS OF OUR EXPORTS -- THEY
ACCOUNT FOR A BIG PROPORTION OF OUR TRADE, BUT ONLY A SMALL
PART OF THE US MARKET. WE MUST START FROM THE ACTUAL
CIRCUMSTANCES. RECENTLY, WE SENT A TEXTILE GROUP TO THE
TO HAVE CONSULTATIONS WITH YOU. THIS SHOWS WE WISH
TO SOLVE PROBLEMS THROUGH CONSULTATIONS. WE HOPE YOU
WILL CONSIDER THIS PROBLEM POSITIVELY, WHICH WILL BE
BENEFICIAL TO TRADE.
KATZ: LET ME EMPHASIZE, OUR OBJECTIVE IS NOT TO BUILD
PROTECTIONISM INTO THE AGREEMENT, BUT TO AVOID HAVING TO
RESORT TO PROTECTIONISM. ESSENTIALLY WE DO THAT BY
PROVIDINGFOR APROCEDURE FOR CONSULTATIONS SO SMALL
PROBLEMS DO NOT BECOME WORSE OR UNMANAGEABLE.
WANG: WE THINK IT IS BETTER NOT TO PUT A PROTECTIONIST
CLAUSE IN THE AGREEMENT.
KATZ: WE HAVE A REQUIREMENT FOR SUCH A CLAUSE (READS
PASSAGE FOROM SECTION 405 OF THE TRADE ACT). AS A PRACTICAL
MATTER, WE ARE REQUIRED BY LAW TO PUT SUCH A PROVISION IN
THE AGREEMENT, BUT, IN FACT, WE THINK THAT SUCH LANGUAGE
IS HELPFUL TO YOU RATHER THANHARMFUL TO YOU. IT IS NOT
OUR PRACTICE, AS IS THE CASE OF SOME COUNTRIES, TO PUT
LIMITS IN THE AGREEMENT ON WHAT YOU CAN SELL TO US. WE
DO NOT WANT TO DO THAT, BUT WE MUST HAVE SOME PROCEDURE
FOR DEALING WITH PROBLEMS IF SUCH PROBLEMS ARISE OR
THREATEN TOARISE -- ESPECIALLY TO PROVIDE FOR CONSULTATIONS
TO FINA A MUTUAL SOLUTION. BUT IF THEY ARE NOT RESOLVED,
WE MUST HAVE THE RIGHT TO TTAKE ACTION. WE CAN PROVIDE
SOME TEXTS WHICH YOU CAN SEE ARE NOT PROTECTIONIST -- WHICH
ARE NOT RESTRICTIVE, BUT ASSIST IN RESOLVING PROBLEMS.
WANG: WE THINK SUCH WORDING IS PROTECTIONIST IN NATURE -AP CAN NOT UNDERSTAND YOUR POSITION. IN PRINCIPLE, IN

ORDER TO DEVELOP TRADE, WHEN WE HAVE PROBLEMS WE NEED TO
MUTUALLY SOLVE THEM. WE CAN PUT THIS IN THE AGREEMENT
FROM OUR SIDE, WE DO NOT TINK THAT WE WILL CAUSE MARKET
DISRUPTIONS.
KATZ: LOOKING AT THE PROBLEM FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE, WE SEE
A NATION OF 900 MILLION PRODUCERS;.
WANG: OR, WE CAN SAY WE HAVE 900 MILLION CONSUMERS AS WELL*
(LAUGHTER) (TELLS JOKE ABOUT CHINESE POUPLATION)
KATZ: WHAT WE ARE PROPOSING WILL NOT BE A PROBLEM.
WANG: WE WILL STUDY THIS FURTHER. WE HOPE ALL THE WORDING
WILL BE POSITIVE -- NOT NEGATIVE. WE WILL STUDY THE ACTUAL
WORDING TO DEVELOP A CLAUSE.
KATZ: THE NEXT SUBJECT RELATES TO COPYRIGHTS, PATENTS, AND

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
INDUSTRIAL PROPERTY. SUCH A CLAUSE IS REQUIRED BY OUR LAW.
SPECIFICALLY, WE WANT TREATMENT EQUIVALENT TO THAT PROVIDED
IN THE PARIS CONVENTION AND THE INDUSTRIAL PROPERTY
CONVENTION. IN THE MEETING THIS MORNING, YOUR MINISTER SAID
THAT YOU PROVIDED SUCH PROTECTON. BUT IT WOULD BE DESIRABLE -ESSENTIAL-- TO HAVE SUCH A PROVISION SET OUT IN THE TRADE
AGREEMENT TO GIVE CONFIDENCE TO OUR INVESTORS AND TRADEERS.
I UNDERSAND TAHT YOU ARECONSIDERING JOINING THESE TWO
CONVENTIONS. I ASSUME THAT THE SECRETARIATS OF THESE
TWO CONVENTIONS HAVE PROVIDED TECHNICAL ADVICE ON THE LAWS
ANDREGULATIONS THAT ARENECESSARY. IN ADDITION, WE HAVE EXPERTS
IN OUR
GOVERNMENT WHICH COULD ASSIST IN THIS IF
REQUIRED. WE ARE VERY INTERESTED IN HEARING WHAT THE
POSSIBILITIES AARE IN THIS AREA AND THE STATUS OF YOUR
NEGOTIATIONS WITH THESE TWO ORGANIZATIONS.
WANG: WE HAVE A RELEVANT DEPARTMENT HANDLING PATENTS
AND COPYRIGHT AFFAIRS. AS FOR THE PARIS CONVENTION, THE
DEPARTMENTS CONCERNED ARE ACTIVELY CONSIDERING THIS. IN
THE PAST FEW YEARS, WE DID NOT HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO
CONSIDER THIS &quot;DUE TO A NUMBER OF REASONS&quot;. WE ARE NOW
ENGAGED IN INTERNATIONAL ACTIVITIES. THE ORGANIZATIONS
CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL
PAGE 04

BEIJIN 01333 04 OF 09 100736Z

CONCERNED ARE ACTIVELY CONSIDERING THIS SUBJECT. EVEN
THOUGH WE HAVE NOT PARTICIPAED IN THE PARIS CONVENTION,
WE HAVE ACTIVELY PROTECTED PATENTS. WE ABIDE BY THE
CONVENTION BY HONORINGCONTRACTS SIGNED BY ENTITIES OF
BOTH COUNTRYES. WE HAVE IMPORTED PATENTS FROM JAPAN AND
OTHER COUNTRIES, AND SO FAR THERE HAVE BEEN NO COMPLAINTS
CONCERNING OUR
FAILURE TO HONOR THE CONTRACTS. BUT THIS
DOES NOT EXCLUDE THE POSSIBILITY THAT CHINA WILL PARTICIPATE
IN THIS CONVENTION. YOU CAN HAVE FULL CONFIDENCE IN CHINA.
WHEN WE SIGN THE TRADE AGREEMENT, WE WILL NOT NECESSARILY
BE ALREADY PARTICPATING IN THE PARIS CONVENTION -- THESE
ARE TWO DIFFERENT THINGS. WE CAN CONSIDER THE WORDING -HOW TO EXPRESS THIS IN THE TRADEE AGREEMENT.
COPYRIGHTS AREHANDLED BY ANOTHER DEPARTMENT. AT
PRESENT, MANY OTHER DEPARTMENTS IN CHINA ARE NEGOTIATING
WITH THEIR COUNTERPARTS ON THE US SIDE, FOR EXAMPLE,
IN SCIENCE ANDTECHNOLOGY AND CULTURE. MAYBE THIS WILL
BE COVERED IN OTHER AGREEMENTS.
KATZ: I THINK THAT FROM WHAT YOU SAY, WE CAN FIND WORDING
TO MEET OUR LEGAL RQUIREMENTS AND TO SATISFY THE CONFIDENCE
OF TRADERS AND INVESTORS. IF IT WERE INCLUDED IN THE AGREEMENT, IT WOULD NOT BE NECESSARY TO HAVE THIS IN THE S&amp;T AREA.
BUT ITHINK IT WILL BE POSSIBLE TO FIND SOMEWORDING WHICH
WILL BE ACCEPTABLE TO BOTH SIDES.
WANG: WE CAN STUDY THIS FURTHER.

FOR IMPARTIAL ARBITRATION IF THE PARTIES CAN NOT OTHERWISE

BUT WE ARE PROPOSING A GENERAL PROVISION.
WANG: WE AGREE TO INCLUDE SUCH A PROVISION IN THE AGREEMENT,
ALTHOUGH WE HOPE THAT THE BUYERS AND SELLERS HAVE NO
DISPUTES -- THAT THEY AVOID THEM. ACCORDING TO OUR PRINCIPLES,
ALL OUR DISPUTES SHOULD BE SETTLED BY MUTUAL DISCUSSION. IF
THERE IS NO SOLUTION, THEN THE QUESTION CAN BE SUBMITTED TO
ARBITRATION FOR SETTELEMENT. ARBITRATION CAN BE HELD EITHER
IN THE US, CHINA, OR IN A MUTUALLY AGREED THIRD COUNTRY.
WE CAN AGREETO THIS. THE CCPIT ISRESPONSIBLE FOR THIS.
THERE IS A LEGAL DEPARTMENT IN THE CCPIT WHICH HAS RESPONSIBILITY. THE PURPOSE IS TO PROMOTE TRADE -- TO PROMOTE TRADE
BY SOLVING PROBLEMS THROUGH MEDIATION. (LAUGHS) WE CAN

FOR SUSPENSION IN CASES OF NATIONAL SECURITY.THIS IS A
TECHNICAL POINT REALLY.
WANG: WHAT DOES IT MEAN?
KATZ: ITWOULD ESSENTIALLY STATE, ACCORDING TO ONE FORMULATION, &quot;THE PROVISIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT SHALL NOT LIMIT
THE RIGHT OF EITHER PARTY TO TAKE ANY ACTION FOR THE
PROTECTION OF ITS SECURITY INTERESTS.&quot;
WANG: PLEASE EXPLAIN WHAT THAT MEANS.
KATZ: ESSENTIALLY IT COVERS ONLY NATIONAL SECURITY. IF
EITHERCOUNTRYFELT THAT ITS NATIONAL SECURITY WAS THREATENED,
IT COULD SUSPEND THE PROVISIONS OF THE AGREEMENT. THIS IS
AN OVERRIDING PROVISION.
WANG: THIS IS ONLY CONNECTED WITH THE TERMS AND RESPOSIBILITIES
OF THE TRADEAGREEMENT?
KATZ: YES, ALTHOUGH THERE IS A QUESION OF EXPORT CONTROL
WHICH WE MAINTAIN FOR NATIONAL SECURITY REASONS.
WANG: WE DON'T THINK THAT THERE EXISTS SUCH A PROBLEM -BECAUSE YOUR EXPORTER SIGNS CONTRACTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH
US LAWS AND REGULATIONS. SO WE THINK THAT THE US
GOVERNMENT SHOULD OFFER FACILITATION TO BUSINESSMEN. WE
THINK THIS CLAUSE IS CONTRARY TO THE DESIRE TO DEVELOP TRADE.
KATZ: IT ISIN ONE SENSE -- IT IS AN EXCEPTION TO EVERYTHING IN THE AGREEMENT. IT PROVIDES FOR NONPERFORMANCE.

PREFERABLY, IT WOULD NOT BE USED. BUT THERE MAY BE TIMES
AND CIRCUMSTANCES WHEN EITHER COUNTRY MIGHT FEEL THAT IT
COULD NOT HONOR THE AGREEMENT FOR NATIONAL SECURITY REASONS.
WANG: WETHINK BOTH SIDES SHOULD HAVE FURTHER CONSULTATIONS
ON THIS SUBJECT. FROM THE STANDPOINT OF THE ACTUAL SITUATION, SOME MEASURES THATTHE US GOVERNMENT HAS TAKEN
HAVE NOT BEEN BENEFICIAL TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF TRADE. WE
HAVE SIGNED A NUMBER OF CONTRACTS WITH AMERICAN FIRMS FOR
WHICH THE US GOVERNMENT HAS REFUSED TO GRANT EXPORT
LICENSES. SO THE CONTRACTS ARE STILL OUTSTANDING - THEY

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
CAN NOT BE HONORED. FOR SOME ITEMS, THE PROBLEM WAS
SOLVED BUT IT TOOK A LONG TIME. SOME OF YOUR PRODUCTS
ARE ADVANCED IN TECHNOLOGY, THAT IS, YOU ARE COMPETITIVE
IN THIS AREA. IF YOU IMPOSE RESTRICTIONS ON EXPORTS,
YOU LIMITEDYOUR ABILITY TO EXPORT (LAUGHTER). ADVANCED
TECHNOLOGY PRODUCTS FROM THE US HAVE BEEN IMPORTANT
IN OUR TRADE AND THEY ARE REQUIRED FOR THE FOUR MODERNIZATIONS. IF WE INTRODUCE HIGH TECHNOLOGY PRODUCTS FROM TH
US, THIS WILL RAISE THE STANDARDS OF THE FOUR MODERNIZATIONS. WE DON'T THINK THIS WILL THREATEN THE US
THE MOREPOWERFUL CHINA IS, THE MORE THIS WILL CONTRIBUTE
TO THE US SECURITY.
KATZ: UNFORTUNATELY, WE LIVE IN AN IMPERFECT WORLD. IT
IS A MATTER OF MUCH REGRET THAT WE MUST SPEND SO MUCH OF
OUR RESOURCES, EVEN HUMAN LIFE, IN WHAT WE REGARD AS
NATIONAL SECURITY. WE LIVE WITH THREATSTOSECURITY.
SOME AE REAL; SOME PERHAPS ARE NOT REAL, BUT THEY ARE
PERCIEIVED AS REAL. WE ALL TAKE MEASURES TO PROTECT OUR
SECURITY. WE HAVE TRIED TO REDUCE THE THREAT IN VARIOUS
WAYS -- THROUGH WORK IN THE UNITED NATIONS AND INDEVELOPING
RELATIONS WITH COUNTRIESAND REGIONS OF THE WORLD, THROUGH
DISARMAMENT, THROUGH THE TREATIES ON NUCLEAR NON-PROLIFERATION,
BUT DESPITE THESE EFFORTS, THERE ARE PROBLEMS AND THREATS
THAT REMAIN. SO, MAYBE THIS PROVISION IS INCONSISTENT WITH
THE GENERAL THRUST OF OUR EFFORTS WHICH PROVIDE FOR THE
EXPANSION OF TRADE, BUT HERE WE MAY IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES

HAVE TO SUSPEND AN AGREEMENT. THIS IS A DELIBERATE EFFORT,
WHICH WE FEEL ISREQUIRED.
WANG: I WOULD LIKE TO SAY A FEW WORD WHICH ARE ON ANOTHER,
UNRELATED, SUBJECT. YOU WANT TO LIMIT STRATEGIC WEAPONS.
YET THE MORE YOU LIMIT THEM, THE MORE YOU STRENGTHEN &quot;THE OTHER
COUNTRY.&quot;
DISARMAMENT IS NOT MUTUAL. SUCH A PROBLEM
THAT CONGRESS MIGHT TAKE SUCH A NEGATIVE ACTON. AGAIN,
THIS IS ATECHNICAL, LEGAL REQUIREMENT RATHER THAN A
POINT OF GREAT SUBSTANCE.
WANG: GOOD.
KATZ: THE LAST POINT IS INDUSTRIAL COOPERATION AND INVESTMENT.
HERE, WE THOUGHT ITWOULD BE DESIRABLE TO PUT IN PROVISIONS
ON THESE SUBJECTS WHICH WOULD PROMOTE AND FOSTER INVESTMENT.
WE ARE VERY INTERESTED AND PLEASED WITH THEDISCUSSIONS UNDERWAY WITH US FIRMS WITH RESPECT TO MAJOR INDUSTRIAL CORPORATIONS. WE WERE VERY INTERESTED IN HEARING THEPLANS OF THE
MINISTER AND VICE PREMIER YU QIULI CONCERNING COMPENSATION
TRADE, JOINT VENTURES, COPRODUCTION, AND SO FORTH. OUR
THOUGHT WAS THAT WE COULD INCLUDE PROVISIONS IN THE AGREEMENT
TO ENCOURAGE THESE ARRANGEMENTS. FRANKLY, WE HAVE NO LANGUAGE
PREPARED ON THIS, BUT WE WANT TO GET YOUR REACTION TO PUTTING

WANG: WE ARE CONSIDERING LAWS ON ALL THESE SUBJECTS. OUT
STATE CORPORATIONS HAVE ALREADY SIGNED AGREEMENTS WITH
AMERICAN FIRMS AND OTHER FOREIGN FIRMS. WE THINK THESE ARE
LEGAL. IT TAKES TIME FOR US TO MAKE LAWS CONCERNING INVESTMENT, COMPENSTATION TRADE, JOINT VENTURES, AND COPRODUCTION.
IN ORDER TO EXPRESS OUR JOINT DESIRE, WE CAN INCLUDESUCH

YESTERDAY COVERED QUITE A LOT OF GROUND -- ALL THE ELEMENTS
WE THINK SHOULD BE IN A TRADE AGREEMENT. THE NEXT STEP,
I THINK, WOULD BE TO LOOK AT SOME ACTUAL LANGUAGE, RATHER
THAN STUDYING THESE PROVISIONS IN GENERAL. I WOULD LIKE
TO PROPOSE THAT SOME DAYS AFTER WE LEAVE, EITHER WE PROVIDE
LANGUAGE ON OUR SIDE, OR IF YOU HAVE LANGUAGE, WE EXCHANGE
DRAFTS. THAT IS, ON MARCH 15, SAY, EXCHANGE DRAFTS AND,
IF CONVENIENT, A MONTH OR SO AFTER THAT PLAN TO HAVE THE
FIRST MEETING. I THINK, TO MAKE OUR WORK MOST EFFICIENT,
WE MIGHT PLAN TO HAVE TEXTS OF A DRAFT AGREEMENT TO
ALLOW TIME FOR CONSIDERATION AND TO ALLOW TIME FOR AN
EXCHANGE OF VIEWS THROUGH DIPLOMATIC CHANNELS -- THAT IS
THROUGH OUR NEW EMBASSIES. THEN, WE CAN PLAN FOR A
MEETING AFTER THAT. WE WOULD WELCOME A CHINESE DELEGATION
TO VISIT WASHINGTON TO DISCUSS THESE MATTERS.

ON MARCH 15 AND IN ANOTHER TWO OR THREE WEEKS OR A MONTH
LATER TO MEET TO EXCHANGE PRELIMINARY VIEWS.
KATZ: YES. IN THAT TWO TO THREE WEEK PERIOD THERE MIGHT
BE SOME QUESTIONS OR PROBLEMS, AND WE CAN EXCHANGE VIEWS
THROUGH OUR RESPECTIVE EMBASSIES.

ON MARCH 15. TWO OR THREE WEEKS AFTER EXCHANGING DRAFT
AGREEMENTS WE CAN HAVE AN INITIAL EXCHANGE OF VIEWS
THROUGH THE US EMBASSY IN BEIJING.(DISCUSSION AMONG
THE CHINESE -- NOT TRANSLATED -- ABOUT THE TIMING OF THE

WANG: WE WILL LEAVE THIS OPEN?
KATZ YES, BUT WITH THE UNDERSTTANDING THAT IT WILL BE

WANG: GOOD.
KATZ: IN HELPING US TO DEVELOP OUR THOUGHTS ON THE AGREEMENT, I HAVE SOME QUESTIONS WHICH I WOULD LIKE TO PUT TO
YOU.
FIRST, IT WOULD BE HELPFUL TO HAVE SOME ESTIMATE OF
YOUR EXPECTATIONS OF TOTAL EXPORTS AND IMPORTS OVER THE
NEXT TWO TO THREE SAARS WITH RESPECT TO AGRICULTURE ON
THE ONE HAND AND INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTS ON THE OTHER.
WANG: AS A WHOLE WE THINK FOREIGN TRADE WILL DEVELOP
FURTHER TOGETHER WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF OUR NATIONAL
ECONOMY. ALL THE STATISTICS ANDSIMILAR INFORMATION ARE
HANDLED BY THE STATISTICAL DEPARTMENTS, BUT THEY HAVE
NOT PUBLISHED THE STATISTICS. JUST RECENTLY, SOME
STATISTICS FOR SOME MAJOR ITEMS OF OUR NATIONAL ECONOMY
HAVE BEEN PUBLISHED, BUT WE HAVE NOT GOT THE STATISTICAL
PICTURE OF THE WHOLE ECONOMY. OUR TRADE FIGURES, W
THINK THESE ARE OPEN TO THE PUBLIC BECAUSE TRADE IS
TWO-WAY. ALTHOUGH SOME FIGURES HAVE BEEN PUBLISHED,
THE METHODS OF CALCULATION VARY FROM ONE COUNTRY TO
ANOTHER -- SO THE FIGURES DON'T AGREE. BUT USUALLY
THERE IS NOT MUCH DIFFERENCE. IN LINE WITH OUR REQUIREMENTS
WE THINK THAT FOREIGN TRADE ILL BE EXPANDINGALONG WITH
THE NATIONAL ECONOMY. INDUSTRIAL OUTPUT WILL INCREASE
BY ABOUT10 PERCENT ANNUALLY. AGRICULTURAL OUTPUT WILL
INCREASE BY FOUR TO FIVE PERCENT ON AN ANUAL BASIS.
DEPENDINGON THE RATE OF GROWTH OF INDUSTRIAL OUTPUT AND
CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL
PAGE 03

BEIJIN 01333 07 OF 09 100841Z

AGRICULTURAL OUTPUT, WE THINK FOREIGN TRADE WILL DEVELOP
ON THE AVERAGE ABOUT 10 PERCENT ANNUALLY. IN THE INITIAL
STAGES, IMPORTS WILL BE GREATER THAN EXPORTS. WE WISH
TO DEVELOP FOREIGN TRADE, BUT FUNDS ARE INSUFFICIENT.
SOME COUNTRIES ARE OFFERING US CREDIT. THAT'S WHY IMPORTS
WILL BE GREATER THAN EXPORTS FOR SOME TIME IN THE FUTURE.
HOWEVER, IN A FEW YEARS, OUR EXPORTS MAY EXCEED OUR IMPORTS
BECAUSE WE HAVE TO PAY BACK OUR DEBT. THIS IS THE GENERAL
IDEA. SINO-US TRADE WILL REGISTER A REMARKABLE ACHIEVE-

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
MENT. VICE PREMIER DENG XIAOPING SAID DURING HIS STAY
IN THE UNITED STATES THAT SINO-US TRADE WILL BE DOUBLED.
IF BOTH SIDES FACILITATE TRADE, THIS POSSIBILITY EXISTS.
BEFORE NORMALIZATION, SINO-US TRADE GREW, THEN FELL.
AFTER NORMALIZATION, WE THINK TRADE WILL DEVELOP STEADILY -NOT FLUCTUATIONS LIKE A SNAKE -- BUT STEADY GROWTH.
JOINT EFFORTS ARE REQUIRED FOR HIS PURPOSE -- BOTH SIDES
GRANTING MFN -- AND THIS WILL BE BENEFICIAL FOR THE
EXPANSION OF TRADE. WE THINK THAT MFN TREATMENT IS BENEFICIAL FOR BOTH SIDES.
KATZ: SECOND, WITH RESPECT TO STATISTICS, DO YOU ENVISION
THAT THERE MIGHT BE PUBLISHED STATISTICS ON A REGULAR BASIS
IN THE NEAR FUTURE?
WANG: OUR STATISTICAL DEPARTMENT IS STUDYING THIS PROPOSAL.
EVEN IF WE HAVE NO STATISTICS AVAILABLE, HOWEVER, WE CAN
EXCHANGE VIEWS ON THE SITUATION IN ORDER TO PROMOTE MUTUAL
UNDERSTANDING. AS TO THE QUESTION OF WHETHER OR NOT TO
PUBLISH STATISTICS,THIS IS HANDLED BY ANOTHER DEPARTMENT.
KATZ: I MIGHT SAY, WITH THE KIND OF OPEN TRADING RELATIONSHIP WE HOPE TO DEVELOP, IT IS IMPORTANT THAT GENERAL
INTERNATIONAL PRACTICES BE FOLLOWED. IT IS USEFUL FOR
BUSINESS AND GOVERNMENT TO GET A PICTURE OF WHAT THE TRADE
OPPORTUNITIES MIGHT BE. THERE WAS A DISCUSSION OF IMF
MEMBERSHIP, FOR EXAMPLE. THE IMF USUALY PUBLISHES
STATISTICS OF MEMBER COUNTRIES. IT WOULD BE USEFUL IF
WE COULD LOOK FORWARD TO THIS POSSIBILIITY FOR CHINA.
WANG: WE WISH TO ENGAGE IN MORE INTERNATIONAL ACTIVITY.
CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL
PAGE 04

BEIJIN 01333 07 OF 09 100841Z

AS FOR STATISTICS, WE CAN WORK ON IT AND CONSIDER HOW TO
PUBLISH THEM. IN THE PAST WE PUBLISHED STATISTICS. BUT
IN THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS, SUCH WORK STOOD STILL. WE
WOULD NOW LIKE TO RESUME NORMAL WORK. FOR EXAMPLE, PUBLISHING
CUSTOMS STATISTICS CAN BE CONSIDERED NORMAL. WE
SHOULD OFFER THEM TO YOU-- WE DO NOT HAVE THEM AVAILABLE.
WE ARE CONSDERING HOW TO RESUME THIS. PERHAPS YOU
NOTICED IN THE PEOPLE'S DAILY, THE STANDING COMMITTEE
OF THE NPC IS NOW CONSIDERING HOW TO FORMULATE A WIDE RANGE
OF LAWS. WE WISH TO NORMALIZE THESE THINGS, BUT IT
TAKES TIME.
KATZ: THIRD, THE OTHER QUESTION IS WITH RESPECT TO OUR
BILATERAL TRADE. IS THERE ANY GENERAL ESTIMATE YOU COULD
PUT ON THIS FOR THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS, POSSIBLY TO PUT
A DOLLAR FIGURE ON THIS?
WANG: DO YOU KNOW WHAT TOTAL TRADE WAS LAST YEAR?
LINCOLN: $1.14 BILLION, TWO-WAY.
WANG:(AFTER CONSULTING WITH HIS CHINESE COLLEAGUES)
ACCORDING TO OUR STATISTICS, IT WAS ABOUT $1 BILLION. THAT
IS VERY CLOSE. VICE PREMIER DENG STATED THAT HE EXPECTED
US-PRC TRADE TO INCREASE BY SEVERAL-FOLD. ACCORDING TO OUR

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
ESTIMATE, THIS YEAR'S FIGURE WILL BE MUCH BIGGER THAN LAST
YEAR.
KATZ: DO YOU HAVE A FIGURE?
WANG: IT DEPENDS ON THE CONCLUSION OF CONTRACTS; WE
EXPECT A BIGGER FIGURE THIS YEAR. WHAT IS YOUR VIEW?
KATZ: IT IS DIFFICULT FOR USTO KNOW. OUR TRADING SYSTEM
IS MADE UP OF MANY FIRMS. IT IS DIFFICULT TO PUT TOGETHER
A CLEAR PICTURE.

WANG: WE ALSO HAVE THE SAME SITUATION. IT DEPENDS ON
BUSINESS NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN OUR INDUSTRIAL DEPARTMENTS
AND THE US COUNTERPARTS. FOR SOME HIGH TECHNOLOGY
PRODUCTS, WE THOUGHT THE US PRODUCTS ARE VERY GOOD. BUT
FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS, THE AMERICAN EXPORTERS THINK THEY
CAN NOT GET THE SUPPORT OF THE AMERICAN GOVERNMENT. THEY
THINK IF THEY SIGN A CONTRACT, THEY WILL NOT BE ABLE TO
HONOR IT. SO OUR DESIRE CAN NOT BE FULFILLED.
KATZ: IT WOULD BE HELPFUL IN THAT REGARD, IF THERE ARE
PARTICULAR KINDS OF PRODUCTS, IF YOU COULD TELL US, E
MIGHT BE ABLE TO GIVE SOME ADVICE AND THERE ARE CERTAIN
PROBLEMS WHICH WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO RESOLVE. WE WOULD
LIKE TO BE HELPFUL IN THAT REGARD.
WANG: NOW, OUR INDUSTRIAL DEPARTMENTS ARE EXCHANGING VIEWS
WITH THEIR COUNTERPARTS IN THE US. VICE PREMIER YU QIULI
EXCHANGED VIEWS WITH TREASURY SECRETARY BLUMENTHAL ON THE
MAJOR ITEMS WE WISH TO IMPORT. RECENTLY, OIL EXPLORATION
AND PRODUCTION IS A VERY ACTIVE AREA; ALSO CHEMICAL PLANTS AND
EQUIPMENT; WE WISH TO MAKE FULL USE OF OUR WATER RESOURCES,

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
SO WE NEED HYDROPOWER EQUIPMENT; WE CAN ECHANGE VIEWS ON
COOPERATION IN THE METALLURGICAL INDUSTRIES. WE ARE ALSO
INTERESTED IN PRECISION INSTRUMENTS CONNECTED WITH

ELECTRONICS AND COMPUTERIZED SYSTEMS.
KATZ: ON THE POINT YOU MENTIONED A MOMENT AGO REGARDING
THE UNCERTAINTIES OF FIRMS ONTHAT THEY CAN EXPORT, AS YOU
KNOW WE HAVE EXPORT CONTROL ON CERTAIN TYPES OF GOODS.
WANG: IF YOU DID NOT EXPORT THESE SAME COMMODITIES TO
OTHER COUNTRIES, WE WOULD HAVE NO COMPLAINTS, BECAUSE
THIS WOULD BE EQUAL TREATMENT.
KATZ: IT IS SOMETIMES NOT THAT CLEAR. IT IS NOT ALWAYS A
QUESTION OF THE COUNTRY TO WHICH A PRODUCT IS BEING
EXPORTED, BUT THE PURPOSE OF THE USE OF THE GOODS.
FREQUENTLY IT ISA QUESTION OF ASSURING OURSELVES THAT
THE PROPOSED USE OF THE GOODSWOULD NOT MAKE PROBLEMS
FOR US. MR. MARCUSS RECENTLY MET WITH YOUR LIAISON OFFICE
IN WASHINGTON TO INFORM THEM OF CERTAIN FORMAL REQUIREMENTS
WE HAVE FOR EXPORTS. THESE ARE REQUIREMENTS ATHAT ARE
REALLY IMPOSED ON ALL COUNTRIES. MR. MARCUSS' VISIT WAS
REALLY AN EFFORT TO FACILITATE XPORT LICENSING, AND IN
THAT SENSE I MADE THEPOINT A MOMENT AGO -- IF WE KNOW
OF A PARTICULAR INTEREST, WE CAN GIVE ADVICE ON HOW TO
AVOID PROBLEMS. THE OFFICE OFEXPORT ADMINISTRATION
IN THE DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE CAN BE A POINT OF CONTACT
FOR YOUR NEW EMBASSY. OF COURSE, MOST BUSINESSMEN KNOW
HOW TO GET ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS, BUT FREQUENTLY THE ANSWER
DEPENDS ON THE USE OF THE PRODUCT AND THAT INFORMATION WE
MUST GET FROM YOU. I THINK IF WE DEVELOP RELATIONS,
PROCEDUREES AND CONFIDENCE -- I THINK THE PROBLEMS IN
THIS AREA WILL BE VERY FEW.
WANG: WE HOPEYOU UNDERSTAND THE PRINCIPLE THAT THE MORE
WE EXPORT TO THE US, THE MORETRADE WILL DEVELOP. WE THINK
IT IS A NATURAL TENDENCY THAT CHINA WISHES TO DEVELOP ITS
NATIONAL ECONOMY AND CHANGE ITS BACKWARD STATUS. IF
CHINA IS MORE FLOURISHINGAND POWERFUL, IT WILL HAVE A
GREATER ABILITY FOR EXPORTING, AND MORE IMPORTS WILL FOLLOW.

BEIJIN 01333 08 OF 09 100914Z

IN NO WAY WILL THIS AFFECT THE NATIONAL SECURITY OF THE US.
WE MUST JUDGE THIS MATEER FROM THE ANGLE OF PRINCIPLE. WE
KNOW YOU HAVE REGULATIONS AND RULES GOVERNING YOUR EXPORTS.
W THINK WE CANCONSULT IN THESE MTTERS. WE THINK THAT
THE US ADMINISTRATION WILL FACILITATE THIS.
KATZ: WE HAVE PRINCIPLES AND POLICIES WHICH IN SOME CASES

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
MAY BE DIFFERENT. OUR TASK IS TO FIND THE MUTUAL INTEREST.
OUR TASK IS TO TRY TO MEET THE LARGER OBJECTIVE OF DEVELOPING TRADE RELATIONS IN THE CONTEXT OF DIFFERING ECONOMIC
SYSTEMSAND IN SOME CASES DIFFERING POLITICAL OBJECTIVES.
BUT WE ARE CONFIDENT THAT WE CAN BRIDGE THESE DIFFICULTIES
IF WE APPROACH THE PROBLEMS IN A PRACTICAL MANNER. OUR
FIRST TASK IS TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THE PRINCIPLES, POLICIES,
LAWS, AND REGULATIONS ARE.
WANG: WE AGREE WITH YOUR OPINION. WE THINK
WE MUST JUDGE THEMATTER FROM THEWHOLE PERSPECTIVE -- TOTAL TRADE
RELATIONS BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES AND THE HARMFUL EFFECTS
OF YOUR EXPORT CONTROLS. ALTOUGH OUR SYSTEMS ARE DIFFERENT,
WE HAVE A COMMON DESIE TO DEVELOP TRADE. IT IS A COMMON
GROUND. WE THINK BOTH COUNTRIES HAVE SIMILAR OUTLOOKS IN
INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS. WHEN WE DEAL WITH SPECIFIC PROBLEMS,
WE MUST TTAKE ALL FACTORS INTO ACCOUNT BECAUSE THEY ARE
CONNECTED WITH THE GENERAL PRINCIPLES. AS FOR US OFFICIALS,
YOU HAVE A POLICY THAT YOU MUST TREAT CHINA AND THE SOVIET
UNION EQUALLY. WE UNDERSTAND THAT YOU HAVE THIS POSITION.
BUT WHEN YOUDEAL ON SPECIFIC MATTERS, YOU CAN NOT TREAT
THESEE MATERS EQUALLY.
KATZ: OUR POLICY IS NOT TO TREAT ONLY THE USSR AND CHINA EQUALLY
BUT TO TREAT ALL COUNTRIES EQUALLY.IN ONE WAY, OUR EXPORT
CONTROLS DO NOT DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN THE USSR OR BRAZIL
OR FRANCE. THIS DOES NOT MEAN THAT WE APPROVE SPECIFIC
EQUIPMENT FOR ONE COUNTRY OR ANOTHER, BUT THAT THE POLICY
IS CONSISTENT. THE JUDGMENTSWE MAKE ARE THE SAME FOR
EACH COUNTRY ALTHOUGH THE DECISIONS MAY BE DIFFERENT.
WANG: WE HOPE YOU HAVE FEXIBILITY.

KATZ: WE DO, AND LET ME EMPHASIZE OUR OBJECTIVE IS TO
PUT THE EMPHASIS ON THE POSITIVE NOT THE NEGATIVE. WE
WANT VERY MUCH TO DEVELOP TRADE WITH CHINA; WE MUST WORK
WITHIN THE OTHER POLICIES WE MAY ENCOUNTER, BUT OUR
OBJECTIVE IS TO OVERCOME THE PROBLEMS AND EXPAND TRADE.
WANG: WE HOPE THE SITUATION WILL IMPROVE IN THE TIMES
AHEAD. WE ARE GOING TO SET UP A JOINT ECONOMIC COMMITTEE.
THIS COMMITTEE CAN DISCUSS MAJOR ITEMS.
KATZ: I THINK THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT. MANY OF THE PROBLEMS
WE HAVE OR APPEAR TOHAVE CAN EASILY BE RESOLVED THROUGH
DISCUSSIONS. IF WE BUILD A PRACTICE OF REGULAR CONSULTATION,
WE CAN DECREASE THE NUMBER OF PROBLEMS ENCOUNTERED AND THE
MAGNITUDE OF THE PROBLEMS. I THINK YOU WILL FIND THAT ALL
PARTS OF OUR GOVERNMENT WILL BE VERY OPEN TO DISCUSSIONS
WITH YOU. THE PURPOSE OF THE JOINT COMMITTEE WILL BE TO
FIND SOME FOCUS TO THE OVERALL RELATIONS AND ALSO TO PROVIDE A PLACE TO RESOLVE PROBLEMS WHICH CAN NOT BE RESOLVED
THROUGH NORMAL CHANNELS.

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
WANG: WE THINK THAT THE JOINT COMMITTEE WILL PROVIDE A
FOCAL POINT AND ALSO ENABLE USETO RESOLVE MINOR PROBLEMS.
I THINK THERE STILL EXISTS SOME PROBLEMS ON THE AMERICAN
SIDE. WE HOPE THE US ADMINISTRATION WILL MAKE EFFORTS TO
RESOLVE THESE PROBLEMS. INTERMS OF OUR EXPORTS TO THE
US, WE HOPE THE US GOVERNMENT WILL MAKE EFFORTS TO BRING
ABOUT THE EXPANSION OF TRADE IN THIS DIRECTON. IN THE
PREVIOUS TRADE, WE HAD AN UNFAVORABLE BALANCE. IN THE
PRESENT SITUATION, WE DO NOT REJECT THE POSSIBILITY OF TRADE
IMBALANCES.
BUT WE THINK IT IS NECESSARY FOR BOTH SIDES TO DIMINISH
THE IMBALANCES-- JOINT EFFORTS ARE REQUIRED. WE HOPE

YOU WILL FACILITATE OUR EXPORTS. ON SOME ITEMS YOU HAVE
RESTRICTIONS; WE HOPE YOU WILL GIVE US A FAIR QUOTA.
OTHERWISE, HOW CAN WE PAY FOR OUR IMPORTS? I QUITE AGREE
WITH YOU THAT WE SHOULD FACILITATE TRADE.
KATZ: FOR WHICH PRODUCTS:
WANG: IF WE RESOLVE MFN THAT WILL FACILITATE OUR EXPORTS.
FOR THE NEXT STEP, WE HOPE YOU WILL EXTEND GSP. CONCERNING
TEXTILES, WE HOPE THAT YOU WILL GIVE USA FAIR QUOTA. WE
DO NOT ASK FOR FREE TRADE, BUT THE QUOTA MUST BE REASONABLE.
WETHINK OUR REQUEST IS VERY REASONABLE,AND YOU CAN DO THIS.
KATZ: TEXTILES IS THE ONLY PROBLEM TO WHICH YOU REFER?
WANG: YES.
KATZ: MFN, WE HOPE AND EXPECT YOU WILL BE RESOLVED OVER THE
COURSE OF THE YEAR. AS WE PROCEED WITH CONGRESSIONAL CONSULTATIONS, WE CAN BEGIN NEGOTIATIONS FOR A TRADE AGREEMENT;

COUNTRY: &quot;THE DIFFICULT THINGS WE DO RIGHT AWAY, THE

BEIJIN 01333 09 OF 09 100913Z

KATZ:I THINK WE SHOULD SPEND A FEW MINUTES ON TEXTILES.
AS SECRETARY BLUMENTHAL SAID YESTERDAY TO MINISTER LI,
THIS IS A VERY DIFFICULT PROBLEM -- A WORLD WIDE PROBLEM.
I THINK YOU KNOW FROM YOUR RELATIONS WITH OTHER COUNTRIES
THAT THIS IS A PROBLEM WITH OTHER COUNTIES, AS WELL.
IN EUROPE, THEY HAVE PUT AN ABSOLUTE QUOTA ON THEIR
TEXTILE IMPORTS. MANY COUNTRIES HAVE EMBARGOES ON
TEXTILE IMPORTS. WE DO NOT DO THAT. OUR POLICY IS
RESTRICTIVE, BUT NOT A S RESTRICTIVE AS OTHER COUNTRIES
AND WE HAVE PERMITTED IMPORTS TO INCREASE TO THE US.
AS SECRETARY BLUMENTHAL SAID, WE ARE A BIG MARKET BUT NOT
AN UNLIMITED MARKET.THE TEXTILE AND APPAREL INDUSTRIES
MUST BE LOOKED AT TOGETHER. IT IS A LARGE INDUSTRY IN
THE US. THE TWO INDUSTRIES EMPLOY A LOT OF WORKERS. IT
IS A PRBLEM OF POLITICAL SENSITIVITY IN THE US AS WELL AS IN OTHER
COUNTRIES -- HOW THE IMPORTS WILL AFFECT THE EMPLOYMENT OF
WORKERS IN THESE INDUSTRIES. WE RECOGNIZE THAT TEXTILES
ARE A NATURAL EXPORT FOR CHINA. IN FACT, YOU HAVE COME
FROM ZERO TO SIXTH PLACE IN OUR MARKET. THAT IS, YOU ARE
NUMBER SIX IN EXPORTS TO OUR MARKET. WHAT WE NEED IS AN
UNDERSTANDING AND AGREEMENT THAT WILL PERMIT YOUR EXPORTS
TO INCREASE AT AA REASONABLE RATE. IT WOULD BE DESIRABLE
IF YOUR EXPORTS WERE NOT CONCENTRATED IN PARTICULAR PRODUCTS. SO W HAVE MADE SUGGESTIONS FOR THE MEANS FOR YOUR
EXPORTS TO CONTINUE TO INCREASE WITHOUT CREATING PROBLEMS
FOR OUR MARKET. I WON'T GO INTOTHE DETWILS OF THE
NEGOTIATIONS AND THE PROPOSALS. I AM NOT REALLY EQUIPPED
TO DO SO.A FURTHER MEETING WILL BE HELD BETWEEN THE TWO
SIDES IN MARCH. WE THINK I IS VERY IMPORTANT THAT A
SOLUTION BE FOUND AT THE NEXT MEETING. IF NO SOLUTION IS
FOUND, ONE WILL BE IMPOSED ON YOU -- AND ON US. WE WILL BE
FORCED TO TAKE UNILATERAL ACTION. IN THE LAST CONGRESS, OVER HALF
THE MEMBERS SUPPORTED A BILL TO AKE UNILATERAL ACTION TO

RESTRAIN TEXTILES. IN OCTOBER, CONGRESSDID PASS LESIGLATION TO REQUIRE THE PRESIDENT TO TAKE TEXTILES OUT OF

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
THE MTN NEGOTIATIONS IN GENEVA. THE PRESIDENTDID NOT
ACCEPT TIS -- HE VETOED THEBILL. BUT AS A PRACTICAL
REALITY, WE CAN NOT IGNORE THEPOLITICAL FORCES IN OUR
COUNTRY. IF WE CAN NOT FINDAA MUTUALLY AGREEABLE SOLUTION,
WE WILL BEFORCED TO TAKE UNILATERAL ACTION -- WHICH WE
DON'T WANT TO DO.
WANG: I AGREE THAT WE SHOULD NOT GO INTO THIS PROBLEM
IN TOO MUCH DETAIL, BUT I WANT TO DISCUSS THE PRINCIPLE.
FIRST, WE EXPORT EXTILES NOT ONLY TO THE US BUT TO MANY
OTHER CONTRIES. SECOND, OUR CAPACITY TO EXPORT TEXTILES
IS LIMITED. THIRD, WE HOPE WE CAN EXERT OUR JOINT EFFORTS
TO FIND A REASONABLE SOLUTION. WE THINK IF YOU GIE US
AN UNFAIR QUOTA -- TAKE UNILATERAL ACTION -- THIS MEANS
YOU CREATED A PRETEXT FOR YOUR UNILATERAL ACTON. WE THINK
THAT IF YOU GIVE US A REAONSABLE AND FAIR QUOTA, WE CAN
FIND A SOLUTION. I WISH TO EPEAT, IF YOU GIVE US AN
UNREASONABLE QUOTA WHICH WE WOULD BE COMPELLED NOT TO
ACCEPT, AND YOU TOOK UNILAERAL ACTION, THIS MEANS THAT
YOU CREATED THE PRETEXT FOR YOUR ATION. WE THINK THIS
CAN BE RESOLVED. WE HOPE WE CAN RESOLVE THIS AT THE NEXT
MEETING. IT IS VERY IMPORTANT.
KATZ: THE ONLY OTHER POINT -- WE TALKED YESTERDAY ABOUT
A MEMORANDUM OF RECORD.WE DID PREPARE SOMETHING LAST
NIGHT, BUT IT NEEDS TO BE AMENDED TO REFLECT THE DISCUSSIONS
THS MORNING. UNFORTUATELY, WE DO NOT HAVE A CLEAN COPY
TO GIVE YOU; THIS ONE IS MARKED UP. LET ME READ THIS TO
YOU AND THEN GIVE YOU A CLEAN COPY LATER. (MR. KATZ
READ THE DRAFT MEMORANDUM OF RECORD.)
WANG: ACCORDING TO OUR PRACTICES, WE HAVE NO PRACTICE OF
PREPARING SUCH A MEMORANDUM OF RECORD. BUT IN ACCORDNCE
WITH YOUR REQUEST, WE CAN WORK OUT SUCH A MEMORANDUM.
PERHAPS WE CAN SAY: &quot;BOTH SIDES HAVE EXCHANGED VIEWS ON
THE CONTENT OF A TRADEAGREEMENT.FOR SOME PROVISIONS,
BOTH SIDES EXPRESSED THEIR RESPECTIVE VIEWS. FOR SOME
CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL
PAGE 04

BEIJIN 01333 09 OF 09 100913Z

PROVISIONS, THERE NEED TO BE FURTHER EXPLORATORY TALKS.&quot;
FOR EXAMPLE, YESTERDAY, WE SPENT A LOT OF TIME DISCUSSING
WHAT YOU CALL &quot;NATIONAL SECURITY&quot;. PERHAPS YOU CAN AMEND
THIS AND GIVE US A CLEAN COPY.
YOU HAVE DONE MORE WORK THAN WE HAVE (ON THE
MEMORANDUM).
KATZ:THAT'S WHY WE'RE HERE. LET ME REITERATE THAT OUR
PURPOSE IS NOT TO COMMIT YOU TO A PARTICULAR VIEW BUT ONLY
TO SET DOWN OUR UNDERSTANDING ON THESE MATTERS FOR THE
RECORD.
WANG: TO REFLECT THE TRUE PICTURE. IN PRINCIPLE WE AGRE,
BUT PERHAPS SOME ADJUSTMENTS IN THE WORDING ARE NEEDED.
KATZ: THANK YOU. I HAVE NO FURTHER ITEMS ON MY SIDE.
I WOULD BE GLAD TO CONSIDER ANY YOU WOULD LIKE TO RAISE.

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014

Sheryl P. Walter Declassified/Released US Department of State EO Systematic Review 20 Mar 2014
WANG: NO, I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING MORE, BUT BOTH SIDES TOOK
A POSITIVE ATTITUDE; BOTH SIDES EXPRESSED THEIR OWN VIEWS.
WE RESPECT YOUR NORMAL PRACTICES AND REULES AND REGULATIONS.
WE HOPE YOU ALSO RESPECT OURS. WE THINK BOTH SIDES HAVE
SOLVED MAJOR ITEMS. SO IT IS EASIER TO RESOLVE THE MINOR
TINGS. WE THINK A TRADE AGREEMENT MUST RESPECT EACH OTHER'S
DESIRES. I GREATLY APPRECIAE THE KIND OF COOPERATION YOU
EXTENDED TO US. DIRECTOR ZHANG, DIVISION CHIEF, WILL HAVE
FURTHER CONTACT WITH YOU ON THE MEMORANDUM OF RECORD.
KATZ: LET ME SAY, I THINK WE HAD TWO DAYS OF PRODUCTIVE
MEETINGS. I FEEL OUR SIDE WE HAVE CCOMPLISHED OUR
MMISSION -- TO LAY THE FOUNDATION FOR NEGOTIAION OF A
TRADE AGREEMENT. WE HAVE CLARIFIED A NUMBER OF MATTERS.
THERE ARE SOME ISSUES FOR WHICH WE NEED TO DO FURTHER
WORK, BUT I FEEL CONFIDENT THAT THE OBJECTIVE OF BOTH
SIDES IS THAT WE CAN RESOLVE THES PROBLEMS VERY QUICKLY.
WE WILL PROVIDE A CLEAN COPY OF THE MEMORANDUM VERY SOON.
